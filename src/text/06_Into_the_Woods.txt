Into the Woods - Fei wakes up after destroying Lahan - 0612
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Uh... Uhn...?

Fei
"Huh...!
Where am I...!?"

Fei
"Doc!!"

Citan
"Oh, you have finally
gained consciousness,
Fei..."

Fei
"Doc...
What happened...?
Where's Chief Lee,
Timothy, Alice...?
What did I...?"

Citan
"Yes...
Well that is..."

Dan
"You murderer!!"

Citan
"Dan!"

Fei
"...!?
Dan,
what do you mean...?"

Dan
"Fei..."

Dan
"It...was because you
had to go get in that
monster...
Alice and Timothy...
The people of the
village are all...!!"

Dan
"You killed everyone
using that monster...!!"

Fei
"...!?"

Townspeople
Why did you have to
fight in the middle
of the village...?

How do you even know
how to operate such
a monster...?

Mother...?
Where mother...?

See, I told you so...
I said allowing someone
we knew nothing about
into our village would
spell disaster...

Owww...
Hurts...It hurts...

Fei
"Dan...!!
E, everyone...
I...!"

Yikes...!

No! Keep away...
I'm scared...

Waaaaaaahhh...

Dan
"Murderer!!
My sister...
Give me back my sister!!"

Citan
"Dan...
There is nothing to be
gained from putting the
blame all on Fei alone.
What is more, you know
Fei had no control over
the malfunction of that
Gear.

Dan
"I...
I know that!"

Dan
"But...
But...!!

Dan
"I HATE YOU!!"

Dan
"Uuuaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"

Fei
"Dan...!?"

Citan
"It might be better if
we left him by himself
for a little while...
He does not know what
to do with his grief,
his anger..."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"And Fei...
It may be a good idea for
you to leave this place.
There is no guarantee
that reinforcements from
yesterday's unit are not
going to come...
They will probably want
to know what happened
to their comrades.
Also, if you stay here, I
do not think the atmosphere
is going to be very joyful
...if you know what I mean.
It is probably best for
both you and all the
other villagers here.

Fei
"I guess you're right...
This disaster happened
because I was here..."

Fei
"But...what am I
supposed to do now...?"

Citan
"Yes, well... Why not go
through the Blackmoon
Forest and head for Aveh?
I am sure those soldiers
from yesterday were not
from Aveh.
If you can manage to get
to the Aveh side, they
will not be able to track
you down very easily."

Fei
"Okay...
I understand, doc..."

Fei
"Well anyway... Please
take care of the rest of
the things here, doc."

Citan
"Of course...
Well, do take care now."

Fei
"..."

You killed everyone with
that monster...!!

Murderer!! My sister...
Give me back my sister!!
Now, Fei, allow me to
spill the blood out of
love...Like the sea of
hell, red, deep...!

Fei
"Gh...!!"
