Fei
"Has Elly gone yet?"

Citan
"Oh, so you were awake?"

Fei
"Yes, I woke up midway, so
I only heard part of what
you two were discussing."

Citan
"..."

Fei
"Elly...
so that's what she is?"

Citan
"Fei, she is..."

Fei
"I know. 
It's not Elly's fault.
What happened to the
village is all my fault.
I took out all my pent up
feelings on Elly. I'm the
one who should apologize."

Citan
"Fei, do not blame 
yourself. It was not 
your fault either.
You were just trying to
protect the village."

Fei
"Thanks, doc...
By the way, how is everyone
from the village going?"

Citan
"Do not worry, Yui is
taking care of them.
I told her to leave soon
and take them all to a
certain place.
They should be safe for a
while. So you just worry
about yourself for now."

Fei
"Okay, doc."

Citan
"Now to think what we
should do next...
Shall we leave this forest
and head for the desert
town of Dazil?
We may learn what Aveh and
Kislev are up to...
not to mention getting some
parts for Weltall.
The leader of Aveh is not
going to sit back and let
the other night's fiasco
go by unpunished!"

?

Fei
"What is that...?"

Citan
"I would assume it is
an aerial battleship
from Aveh..."

Fei
"An aerial battleship?
I've never heard of Aveh
having anything like that."

Citan
"Of course it does
not come from Aveh
originally...
Most likely it belongs
to the Gebler forces
stationed in Aveh."

Fei
"Gebler?"

Citan
"Special forces from the
Sacred Empire of Solaris
known as Gebler.
I am sure you have heard
something about them.
They are an organization
providing large scale
military aide to the
Kingdom of Aveh.
They showed up in Ignas
several months ago.
Until then, Aveh was
being routed by Kislev.
But with Gebler's help
they have managed to
regain half their loses.
They are now expanding
their territory and
gathering resources
buried in the ruins."

Fei
"I've heard the village
elders talk about it...
Is Elly a part of that?"

Citan
"Quite possibly so.
Their group has superior
technology and power.
It is rumored they are
here solely to get the
resources in the ruins.
I am surprised they are
using something as
powerful as that ship...
It must be to supress the
recent border skirmishes."

Fei
"So they are fighting
the Kislev Empire?"

Citan
"Yes. It seems they have
found new ruins on the
northern edge of Aveh.
Those ruins are under a
five-hundred-year-old
temple.
Three weeks ago Kislev
took over those ruins.
Most likely they are
fighting over that."
