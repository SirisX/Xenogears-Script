Pirate
"Hey, come down here now!
I'm not gonna kill you.
All I want is for you to
leave this Gear... Huh?"

Fei
What?

Pirate
"Hey!?
You're not an
Aveh soldier?"

Fei
"I told you that in my
intercom transmission
earlier.
You're the one who
refused to listen to
me, right?"

Pirate
"Hah, ha, ha. Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I remember you were
saying something like that.
I went off half-cocked and
thought you were the enemy.
Uhh, ahem...
My name is Bart.
I'm the pirate that works
this territory."

Fei
"My name is Fei.
I was arrested for no
apparent reason, shoved
into that Aveh transport
ship...
...And was nearly going to
be sent to a concentration
camp until you went and
blew the thing to blazes.
Anyway...
I'm just glad to have
been able to survive."

Bart
"I see...
Well, I'm glad I at least
helped you out a little.
But I didn't expect a
civilian like you would
be riding in a military
Gear.
Besides, this Gear is a
brand new model.
I've never seen this type
before."

Fei
"Let's just say that
a lot of things have
happened...
It wasn't like I
wanted to pilot it!"

Fei
"Where are we anyway?
Looks like we fell into
one weird place.
I've never heard of huge
stalactite caves such as
this existing under the
desert before."

Bart
"What? You don't know
anything, do you?
Where are you from?
The desert only covers
around 1000 sharls of the
outer layer of the earth.
The stratum underneath
that consists of igneous
rock."

Fei
"From a sea of trees to
a sea of sand...and now
a stalactite cave...
What's next...?"

Bart
"What are you
talking about?"

Fei
"Oh, nothing...
Never mind..."

Bart
"We're in trouble...
Look, the hole we fell
through has disappeared.
We'd better find some
other way out...
So, you wanna call a
truce for now?
...At least until we
find an exit and get
out of here."

Fei
"Yes...
agreed.
First, we gotta find
the way out of here...
So, let's get going..."

Soldier 1
Phew, thank god...
I didn't wanna dry up and
die up in the desert...

Mechanic
Hey, you!
I know you're tired but
don't go any further
than there!

Soldier 2
Shut up!
You sunk our ship!
Don't you forget that!

Man
No, you shut up!
Just be thankful that
you were saved!

Nurse
Excuse me...

Is there anyone who is
almost dead, with no arms
and legs, or in need of
an abdominal operation!?

No one...? 
Well that's
depressing...

Citan
"I see...
So your 'young one' has
not just been shooting
at anything and every-
thing then, Sigurd."

Sigurd
"Yes, he actually
calculated this attack...
...or so he says!
As you can see...
no one has died this
time, either."

Gear Pilot
Sigurd, sir!
The collection of the goods
and soldiers from the Aveh
transport is almost complete.
We still can't locate the
young master... General
Maitreya's platoon will
scout around again.

Sigurd
"Okay.
I'm counting on you."

Gear Pilot
Yes, sir!
Since I'm part of the unit
I'll also excuse myself.

Citan
"So, what happened to
this 'young one' you
call 'master'?"

Sigurd
"He fell into an under-
ground cave with that
other guy in a Gear.
It's near an old excavation
site, and he is riding in a
Gear, so he'll probably be
able to come up somehow...
We'll try to find him for a
while, and if that doesn't
work, then we'll wait for
him at our meeting point."

Citan
"You seem to trust
him a lot..."

Sigurd
"Trust him...
Yeah, I trust he'll
get us into trouble."

Sigurd
"But I never thought I
would meet you here,
'Hyu'..."

Citan
"It is not coincidence.
It is an inevitable
consequence...I assume."

Sigurd
"...Hyuga...
Are you saying something
is about to happen?"

Stalactite Cave - Bolder blocks path - Great Hall - 0734
———————————————————————————————————

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
My sensors are responding
to something.
There appears to be quite
a large cavern on the
other side of here."

Bart
"If we can get rid of this
rock...but I don't think
it's possible."

———————————————————————————————————

Bart
"Hey, this is huge.
What can we do with this?
I doubt you can break it."

Fei
"I guess we could
try pushing it..."

Bart
"Wait, no matter how
you look at it..."

Fei
"What the heck are you
doing? Hurry up and
help!!"

Fei
"We can get by if we help
each other.
Let's keep it up so we
can get out of here."

Bart
"The hydromechanic pipe for
my knee joint is on the
verge of breaking down.
It's all because of that
fall from the ceiling...
followed by pushing this
mega-colossal boulder.
It won't be funny if my
Gear malfunctions in a
huge cavern like this."

Fei
"Your friends won't
come and help us?"

Bart
"It'd be a waste of time
waiting. They probably
won't come."

Fei
"But, aren't they your
friends?"

Bart
"We believe in a
liberal upbringing.
They'll think we can
escape by ourselves."

Fei
"I wonder if doc
is okay."

Bart
"Don't worry about the
man you were with.
I'm sure our guys saved
him by now."

Fei
"..."

Bart
"What is it?"

Fei
"...
We wouldn't have fallen
in here if you had only
listened to me."

Bart
"Don't blame it on me!
You should've surrendered
instead of challenging me.
All I wanted was your
Gear."

Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!
You're the one who blindly
attacked me. What else was
I supposed to do?
I thought I might die if
I didn't fight you."

Bart
"I was taking it easy on
you. Couldn't you tell?
Then you're a bit dense."

Fei
"Don't lie to me.
I know you were serious."

Bart
"What! You want some!?
Let's have it out!
Right here!"

Fei
"..."

Bart
"Wait! Settling it
right here comes first.
I won't be able to get
anything done until we
settle this once and
for all!"

Fei
"I thought you wanted a
truce for now? Getting out
of here should come first!
Once we're out of here,
then I'll fight you all
you want. Let's hurry up
and move on out of here!"

Bart
"I don't like you
very much...
Damn it!
I'll get you when we
get outta here."

Fei
"Looks like even a person

Detected amounts of falling sand
above the standard safety figure.
The sand barrier on the south
wall of the Terrace Stones has
been sealed to prevent sand from
penetrating the excavation site.
Until the barrier is reopened,
please assemble at the safety
shelter to the east of the
barrier wall. Thank-you.

Stalactite Cave - Outside Old Man Bal's Cave - 0738
———————————————————————————————————

Bart
"Who'd have thought there
would be someone living
in a place like this!
Let's check it out!"

———————————————————————————————————
Stalactite Cave - Old Man Balthazar's Cave - 0748
———————————————————————————————————

Bart
"Hey, Fei! This is a
surprise! There's someone
living in this place!"

Old Man
Hmm, it's been a while,
but I thought I could hear
the sound of Gears.
I assume they are yours?
Well anyway, come on back
in here and make yourself
at home.

Old Man
It's been a long time
since my last visitor.
What happened? Did you
fall from the surface?

Bart
"I guess that's it."

Old Man
I see...
That's too bad.
I can tell from the sound
that you both ride good
Gears...
But the legs seem to be
playing up a bit.

Fei
"You mean, you can tell
what's wrong just by the
sound of its footsteps?"

Old Man
Ha ha ha.
It's easy to know what's
wrong with Gears by the
sounds they make.
My guess is that one
of them needs a new
hydromechanic pipe
in its joints.
It's making a
nasty sound.
It must be hard to
walk with too.
Oh, by the way, the
name's Balthazar,
but you can call me
Ol' man Bal.

Bart
"Oh yeah? 
So looks like we've got a
real fanatic here, huh!"

Bart
"What's an old man like
you doing in a place 
like this?"

Ol' man Bal
"I guess you can call me a
'fossicker' or a 'collector
of things'.
There is much to be found
lying around in this here
stalactite cavern."

Bart
"A collector, huh?
Sounds interesting."

Bart
"The things on this shelf,
are they some of the stuff
you have found?"

Ol' man Bal
"You mean the fossils?
They're one of the 
things I collect.
Feel free to have a
look at them."

Ol' man Bal
"Around here you can dig up
ancient machines along with
human and animal fossils.
Notice anything particular
on these shelves? They go
from oldest on the left,
to newest on the right."

Bart
"Are you an archaeologist
or something, old man?
I don't quite see what
you're talking about.
They just look like a
bunch of old bones to me.
Fei, what do you think?"

Fei
"...Let me see.
First, there are no
human bones up to here.
Then, from here on over
to the right, something
is slightly different...
I guess."

Ol' man Bal
"Yes, from a certain point
in time, human fossils
suddenly no longer appear.
That point is roughly
10,000 years ago."

Bart
"What does that mean?"

Ol' man Bal
"Don't ask me.
I don't know for sure...
But my guess is, there
were no humans on this
planet before then.
At least it appears so."

Bart
"How could that be?
What about all that
talk about evolution?"

Ol' man Bal
"You mean the theory of
evolution as taught by
the 'Ethos', right?
You can't trust that!
Rather, I believe in the
old legends and myths."

Fei
"Legends?
Myths?"

Ol' man Bal
"Haven't you heard
of this story...?"

Ol' man Bal
"They say that humans and
god lived together in a
paradise in the sky.
With god's protection,
there was no fear of death
and natural disasters were
entirely unknown.
Then one day, the humans
ate a forbidden fruit
which gave them incredible
wisdom.
But god drove mankind from
the paradise for their sin.
Bitter at having been
driven out of paradise,
humans used the wisdom they
had gained to make giants.
With these giants, they
planned to challenge god
himself. But god poured
his wrath down on them.
All who defied god were
destroyed. 
But god himself did not
escape unharmed.
Taking paradise with him,
the wounded god buried
himself deep beneath the
ocean to sleep for eons.
Before going to sleep, god
used his remaining power to
create right-hearted humans
to live on this planet.
These people are said to
be...our ancestors."

Ol' man Bal
"Well, anyway, I'll
stop my rambling now."

Fei
"By the way, does 
this cave have..."

Ol' man Bal
"An exit?
There is an exit in the
excavation site beyond the
sand barrier. You can get
outside through there."

Bart
"Sand barrier? You mean
that huge wall you can
see from your entrance?"

Ol' man Bal
"Yes, that's it.
On the other side is an
old Aveh excavation site.
They built the wall when
Aveh was excavating here
to keep the sand from
falling in from above.
But they've stopped work
there now."

Fei
"So, how do we open such
a huge thing like that?"

Bart
"If it's a wall,
you can probably
break it down."

Ol' man Bal
"Hold your horses
there young'uns.
No matter how good a Gear
you have, you'll never
break that wall down.
It's much too strong.
So...
let's make a deal." 

Bart
"A deal?"

Ol' man Bal
"The wall was closed
due to the reaction of
the 'Sand Sensors'.
Thanks to that, now I
can't get through to
the other side either.
Maybe it happened when
you two fell in here.
Were you boys fighting
up there or something?"

Fei
"You seem to be able
to tell everything!
Anyway, so what can
we do about it?"

Ol' man Bal
"It's very simple.
You just have to turn off
the Sand Sensor switches.
Doing that will keep the
barrier from closing again.
While you two are doing
that, I'll open it up."

Fei
"Right, got it."

Ol' man Bal
"The sensors are in two
places. You should see
their flashing red lights.
Well, good luck then." 

Fei
"Let's go Bart."

Ol' man Bal
"Oh, before you go...
I can share some parts
and fuel with you.
Just talk to me whenever
you need something, right."

Bart
"Thanks, old man.
Well, we'll go and finish
our part of the deal then!"

———————————————————————————————————

Ol' man Bal
"Now hurry and shut off
the Sand Sensors.
Or do you have something
else you want to ask?"
    Where are the sensors?
    About Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, which do you want?"
    For Gear use
    For character use

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items

"It's been a while since
I last serviced a Gear.
This should be fun."

Ol' man Bal
"A Gear's strength changes
with the parts equipped and
how the pilot handles it.
First, let's talk about
the Engine.
With a good Engine your
Attack Power and fuel 
capacity go up.
HP depends on the Frame
and Defense Ability on
the Armor equipped.
Here's a tip for when your
fuel is low: use 'Charge'
to replenish it a little
as you defend yourself.
When you are fighting a
strong enemy, use 'Booster'
to increase your mobility
and power.
If you use Booster too
much though, your fuel
will run out.
So think carefully and
try to find your own
style of fighting."

Ol' man Bal
"First, changing the
engine is a good idea."

Ol' man Bal
"First, try changing
the engine."

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"I don't know where they
are. Can you tell me?"

Ol' man Bal
"One is up on the rock
ledge above the boulder
in the 'Great Hall'.
You can find it by climbing
the 'Terrace Stones' out
there and heading into the
passage on northwest wall.
The other sensor is on
the road from which you
can see the waterfalls.
You can get to it by going
northwest from the place
where the Gear is standing.
It is on a rock ledge.
You can tell that it is a
Sand Sensor by its square
shape and the flashing red
light it emits."

———————————————————————————————————
-AFTER- Shutting off the Great Hall Sand Sensor

Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut off
the 'Sand Sensor' on the
ledge in the Great Hall...
But there's another 'Sand
Sensor' on the road from
which you can see the
waterfalls.
It's on a rock ledge,
northwest of where my
repair robot stands.
Anything else you want?"
    Explain Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items
	
———————————————————————————————————
-AFTER- Shutting off the Waterfall Grotto Sand Sensor

Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut
off the Sand Sensor in
Waterfall Grotto.
But there's still one more,
above the big boulder in
the Great Hall. I think
you've seen it already.
Anything else?"
    Explain Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

Fei
"Well done, old man!"

Ol' man Bal
"Our deal is done."

Bart
"Hey, old man.
There's one thing I
want to ask you."

Ol' man Bal
"What is it?"

Bart
"I've heard somewhere on
this planet is a Gear far
superior to all others.
I've heard that it was
called 'the god Gear' and
was made in ancient times
but hidden away somewhere.
Do you know anything
about it?"

Ol' man Bal
"A man-made god, created
with the wisdom of god!
Such a Gear would have the
power of a thousand Gears.
In a wave of its arm, it
could destroy whole cities.
Its battle cries would
thunder in the heavens.
You must be speaking of
the 'Omnigear'."

Bart
"You know of it?
Then perhaps it was what
you were speaking about in
that tale you told us of
the battle with god..."

Ol' man Bal
"Goodness gracious,
you too, boy?
Those stories were made
to inspire man's soul.
But they're just legends.
They don't really exist."

Ol' man Bal
"Anyway, allow me take
a look at your Gears.
It'll only take a
little while, so
wait here please."

Bart
"Hey, wait!
Arhh, he's gone..."

Fei
"Hey Bart. Do you think the
Gear in that story's buried
in the ground somewhere?"

Bart
"I think that's
what I've heard."

Fei
"Could one of the Gears we
are using possibly be it?"

Bart
"Yeah, right!
What are the chances
of that happening?

Fei
"?"

Bart
"The Gears that are
excavated lately...
...are usually only a
few hundred years old.
Nowhere nearly as old as
the Gear in that legend."

Fei
"Then why were they
in the ground...?"

Bart
"I don't know.
There are no records. 
Except..."

Fei
"Except what?"

Bart
"There must be some truth
in the tales that they were
buried after a great war...
The bullet wounds covering
most of the Gear's armor
would appear to confirm
that."

Fei
"You mean that there are
no records from the last
several hundred years?
How about before that?"

Bart
"None from either period.
The 'Ethos' controls
all the records from
that time period.
Maybe they have some very
ancient records too...
All we know about our
history is from the
little pieces that we
find for ourselves."

Bart
"Anyway Fei, what do you
make of the old man?"

Fei
"What do you mean...?"

Bart
"Why would such an old 
man live all alone in
this abandoned cave?"

Fei
"I don't know. Probably
digging for ancient
Gears or something?"

Bart
"Right!
So you think so too?"

Fei
"Hey!
I just said that as a joke.
Don't take all that stuff 
seriously. They're only
legends, you know."

Bart
"No...that old man 
is up to something!"

Ol' man Bal
"This can't be..."

Fei
"??"

Bart
"What's wrong, old man?"

Ol' man Bal
"Is this your Gear?"

Fei
"Well, 
sort of..."

Ol' man Bal
"Where did you get it?"

Fei
"I'm just borrowing it."

Ol' man Bal
This is...

the host for the spirit
of the slayer of god...

Fei
"Wait a moment! 
What did you just say?"

Ol' man Bal
"Nothing.
I didn't say anything!!"

Fei
"No! I heard you!
You said, slayer of god...
That's what you said,
isn't it old man!!"

Ol' man Bal
"Your Gears are fixed.
You have no more
business here.
This is a bad time for me.
Be on your way!"

Fei
"Be on our way...?
Listen here, old man...!!"

I'll just get these parts
back anyway...

I'll sell them to you...!"

"What the...!?"

Fei
"Get out of the
way, Bart!!"

Bart
"Woooh! What
the hell did
you just do?"

Fei
"......"

Bart
"Hey!!"

Fei
"......huh?"

Bart
"What do you mean
'huh?'!? What in blazes
was that?
... Don't you know?"

Fei
"...No, I err,
......I don't know."

Bart
"That was incredible!
You just blew that huge
thing to pieces!
Why didn't you use
that technique a bit
earlier?"

Fei
"... I don't know that
technique... I have no
idea how I even did it!"

Bart
"Hmm. Oh well, I guess
that doesn't matter.
Anyway...
thanks for helping
me out!"

Fei
"........."

Bart
"So, now that we've got
rid of that nuisance,
let's get out of here,
eh, Fei!"

———————————————————————————————————
Stalactite Cave - Fei and Bart leave the caves - 0752
———————————————————————————————————

Bart
"Wow...
I never thought we'd
end up here..."

Fei
"Where are we?"

Bart
"You see the twin
mountains way over there?
That's where Bledavik, the
Royal Capital of Aveh, and
Fatima Castle are located.
Currently, there's no king
living there though.
Anyway, that's my old home
town."

Fei
"Home town..."

Bart
"I'd like to go ahead and
settle our dispute but...
considering how close we
are to the capital of Aveh,
we'd probably get caught."

Fei
"..."

Bart
"Hey, stop looking so
glum, chum.
I guess I'll have to get
you back to your friend
soon or you'll die from
fretting or something.
Anyway, the rendezvous
point with the Yggdrasil
is right over there.
Don't worry, you'll be
meeting your friend in
no time at all."
