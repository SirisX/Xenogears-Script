Prologue - 0614
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The continent of Ignas, in the
northern hemisphere of our world.
On this, the largest continent,
a war has been raging between two
countries for hundreds of years.
In the north of the continent lies
the Kislev Empire, in the south
lies the desert kingdom of Aveh.
The war has gone on for so long
that the people have forgotten the
cause, knowing only the pointless
circle of hostility and tragedy.

The chronic war obsession was soon
to encounter a devastating change.
This was due to the 'Ethos', an
institution that preserves our
world's culture, repairing tools
and weapons excavated from the
ruins of an ancient civilization.
At once both countries excavated
these ruins, and had the 'Ethos'
repair the discoveries, in order
to increase their military power.

The various weapons excavated from
the ruins greatly changed the form
of warfare.
The outcome of the battles between
the two countries was no longer
determined by man-to-man combat,
but by 'Gears' - giant humanoid
fighting machines - that were
obtained from deep within the
ruins.

Eventually, after continuous
swings in the state of the war,
Kislev gained the upper hand.
The major factor behind this lay
in the enormous difference in the
amount of resources buried within
their ruins.
But suddenly a mysterious military
force appeared in the continent of
Ignas. Called 'Gebler', this force
decided to make contact with Aveh.

With the assistance of this Gebler
military force, Aveh was able to
recover from being hopelessly out-
numbered to being back on an even
standing with Kislev.
Then, taking further advantage of
its newly gained momentum, Aveh
started to capture one territory
after another from Kislev, showing
no indication of slowing down in
their invasion campaign.

The remote village of Lahan,
 in the outskirts of Aveh,
near the border with Kislev.

This is where it all begins.

Lahan Village - Intro Flashback - file3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Huff...huff...
Damn you...!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Hiyaaaaa!"

Fei
"Huff, huff...
That's one down!?"

Fei
"What on earth are you?
No matter how often
I knock you down
you still get up!"

Citan
"Fei! Stop!
You must not
fight here!"

Fei
"Guh!
Boy are you
persistent!"

Fei
"Huff, huff... Damn it!
How come...? Why did it
have to come to this?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Beginning of the Game - Fei's Room - 0634
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Whew!
That about does it..."

Fei
"Alright...
Now for a
short break."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maid
"Hello, Fei.
You're looking well today."

Maid
"My, how time flies! Why, it
has already been 3 years since
you came to our village...
When they first saw you brought
in all bloody and soaken, to
tell you the truth, they didn't
think you were going to make it.
And that strange masked man who
carried you here that day...
Do you think that maybe he was
your real father?
Don't you remember anything?
Why, they say you had terrible
nightmares and constantly
called out for your father."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Flashback - 1974
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Who is it? 

Chief Lee
"Wh, who are you? ...
What? You want me to
look after this boy?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Chief Lee's House Downstairs - 0634
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maid
"But now, you're so
healthy and strong...
And it's all thanks to our
village chief, Lee.
My, should you be grateful!"

Maid
"It's alright for you to
like painting and all...
But please try not to make
so much mess. Cleaning isn't
such an easy job you know!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Chief Lee's House - Wedding Day Plans - 0632
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Timothy
"Yo! Hi there, Fei.
Sorry for us all using
your house like this.
But, we have to talk about
the big day tomorrow with
the village chief."

Fei
"Yeah tomorrow, huh...
Your wedding with Alice!
Now that is a big day!"

Timothy
"Yeah... right...
But it still hasn't hit
me as reality though."

Fei
"Hey, errh, Timothy.
I just want to thank
both you and Alice...
3 years ago, I woke up
in this village without
a trace of my memory...
I didn't know who I was,
where I had been or what
I had been doing up until
that day...
I couldn't recall a
single thing..."

Fei
"Despite that, you and
Alice sympathized with me
and encouraged me to go on.
If the two of you hadn't
have been there for me,
I don't know what would
have become of me..."

Fei
"Timothy...
From the bottom of my
heart, I thank you!
Now, you and Alice
had better live
happily ever after!"

Timothy
"Hah! Quit it will ya!
You don't have to go and
get all mushy on me...
Anyway, to me it feels
like I've always been
friends with you ever
since we were kids."

Timothy
"And we will go on being
friends forever, right?"

Fei
"Of course!"

Timothy
"Oh yeah, Fei...
Could you stop by
and check on Alice?
I still have stuff to
discuss with my old man
and the village chief.
But I'm sure she'll
be glad to have some
company."

Fei
"Yeah, sure!
I'll do that... Anyway,
I'll see you later.
Oh, and I am really
looking forward to the
ceremony tomorrow."

Dan
"So there you are! 
Fei, I have to talk to
you about something!"

Fei
"Why, hello there Dan!
You're lively today...
as you are everyday!"

Timothy
"Dan! Don't be so rude.
What's this barging in
and all?"

Dan
"Argh! Timothy's
here too."

Dan
"Butt out, Timothy!
Until you marry my
sister, you have
nothing to do
with me at all!
I just have some
business here with
my friend Fei!"

Dan
"So anyway Fei, I errh...
I have something to talk
to ya about later..."

Fei
"What is it, Dan?
It sounds serious!"

Dan
"Yeah, that's why I can't
talk about it here...
There's a certain person
listening in who could
cause us trouble...!"

Dan
"It's really important!
We gotta talk, seriously,
one-on-one, man-to-man!
I'll be hanging around
outside. So I'll see
ya there later, OK!"

Dan
"Be seein' ya, Timothy!
Take care of yourself
until tomorrow..."

Fei
"Huh...? 
What's up with him?"

Timothy
"As of tomorrow, I'm
going to be that kid's
brother-in-law...
Hah!
That part isn't going
to be no honeymoon!"

Chief Lee
"Oh, it's you, Fei.
We're in the middle
of discussing Timothy
and Alice's wedding
arrangements."

Chief Lee
"Hey, why don't you bring
a girlfriend or two home
once in a while?
Just because you live with
an old man like me doesn't
mean you have to hold back
now, you hear!?
Why, when I was as young
as you are, it seemed like
everyday I would..."

Ahem!
Ohum!

Chief Lee
"Oh, errh... never mind.
Now, we still have
important things to
discuss... so don't
get in the way now."

Chief Lee
"We still have many
important things to
talk about...
So you had better
not bother us now."

Timothy's Father
"Hello there, Fei.
Our Timothy is a really
lucky boy to be able to
marry such a beautiful
girl like Alice!
I hope you come up with
some embarrassing tales
to tell in your speech!
Hah haah haaah!"

Alice's Uncle
"I don't know whether to be
happy or sad...
Tomorrow, our little Alice
is going to become someone's
wife...
I knew this day would come!
...This is the worst part of
bringing up a little girl!"

Sigh...

Woman
You know Fei, I am sure that
our village chief thinks of
you as his own grandson...
Not having any family for
all those years, and living
on his own for oh so long...
That's why he cares so very
dearly about you!

Please, never do anything that
would break his poor old heart!
You promise me that, Fei!?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-AFTER- After visiting Alice

Timothy
"So how was Alice? I still
can't believe we're really
getting married tomorrow!
It's such a weird feeling.
We've always been together
ever since we were just
little kids..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - 0608
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dan
"Oh good, Fei!
Ya ready to talk?"

Dan
"As you know, tomorrow's
finally the day of my
sister's wedding...
So, what I want to talk
to you about is exactly
that... Alice's marriage!"

Dan
"Fei, to be perfectly
honest with you...
I've always wished
you could have been
my brother."

Dan
"It's still not too late.
You could go steal Alice
and run off with her!
If you need me to help,
I'd be glad to!"

Dan
"It may be odd for me to say
this, but my sister's
beautiful and a good cook...
(and this is just between
you and me but, she's
well endowed too! 
Heh heh heh!)"

Dan
"So c'mon! Go for it!
    Let's do it!!
    That's crazy 

Fei
"Alright Dan,
you've got it...
I guess I'll just go sweep
Alice away and make a run
for it!"

Dan
"Really!?
I knew I liked you, Fei!
That's the spirit!"

Dan
"... But, if only
it was that easy...
It's not like we can
change their feelings...
And you would need to
have love for her too..."

Dan
"But, I'm not gonna
forget this, Fei!
You were really willing to
go that far to help me...
Fei, you're a good guy!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-OPTION 2-
Fei
"Hey...
What are you talking
about, Dan?
Timothy and Alice are both
my best friends.
You know I can't do that!"

Dan
"Tch, yeah I know that.
Well if you're gonna be
like that..."

Dan
"But, if you change your
mind, come and talk to
me!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Timothy is a balding
headed fool! And his dad
is bald and stupid too!"

"Mountain path ahead!
Beware of the HP
gobbling hob-gobs!!
Those wishing to see the
doctor on the mountain top
should proceed with courage
and conviction."

"Alice and Fei
are in looove!!"

"From all the cool
people of Lahan...
  Buon giorno!"

"- The Laughing Fox  
   & Piglet Tavern - 
   Drunks welcome!  "

" - Lahan's General Store - 
    You want it?
    We've got it...(maybe)! "

Fei
"Phew!
That was a close one...
This well is dangerous...
Perhaps it's better if I
don't go near it again."

Received a chill from the
depths of the cistern!
Oh 'well'...!

'High' there Fei!
Did you know that beyond
that black forest lies the
great kingdom of Aveh?
It's got a big capital
city with lots of people
living there.
My father is working
somewhere in Aveh.

Soon, my father is going
to come pick mother and
me up so that we can all
live together in Aveh.

Oh, father!
Please come home soon...

Hey hey, Fei!
Let's go catch some
scampi again sometime!

I'm gonna get you!

Hey hey, Fei!
Help me find another
elephantsparrow's
nest sometime, okay!!?

Run away!

Hey, Fei. Next time,
teach me more of your
kung fu stuff.

I'm gonna get you!

Hey, Fei!
Let's go tease
the girls again!

Run away!

Birds are great...
They can fly so high in
the sky and go wherever
they want to...

You know Fei... Mom
was saying that you
might have come from
a far away place...

If you were a bird,
you could fly back
to your real home
anytime you wanted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
That Dan...!
When will he ever grow up!?

Small Girl
Oh, Fei!
Maybe you can help...
Have you seen Dan?

Fei
"Oh, he's just hanging
about over there...
He's thinking about his
sister's marriage and
doesn't seem to be able
to calm down.
He likes to talk and act
big, but he really is
still just a kid...
It's kinda cute, huh?"

Small Girl
Oh really?
I'm a little suspicious
though...
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...
I bet he's avoiding me...

Small Girl
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...
How could a brat like
him possibly be related
to Alice?
Oh, brother...!

You're right! I've got my
whole life ahead of me!
I've got to strive harder
to fulfil my goals in life.

Sigh... The never ending
hardships of a woman.

Alice and Timothy's
wedding tommorow is
the talk of the town.
I guess it's to be
expected though...
It is one of life's
biggest events.

The women of the village
are born, raised, married
and live out the rest of
their lives here.
There must be some
happiness in that, but...
I've been thinking from
time to time.
Sometimes I wish I were
born a man so I could
travel the world and live
an ever-changing life...

Heh... It's weird, isn't it?
    Yeah, that is weird!
    No, of course not! 

Ooooooh! You think so?
Maybe I need to rethink
this...

Really? Do you mean it?
Hah, I knew you'd say
that for me, Fei.
Here, this is my very
own homemade Aquasol.
Our bearcows love it! 
Try it out sometime!

Received Aquasol, the
choice of all bearcows.

Hello, Fei.
Tomorrow is Alice and
Timothy's big day.
Isn't it exciting!
I know Alice will
make a lovely bride.
Ahh... I hope a
handsome prince comes
into my life soon.

Hey! Stop pushing!
What are you...some
kind of pervert!?

That doctor is weird!
Why would anyone want to
live up on that mountain
peak?
He should live closer to
the village...
Hey, you're good friends
with the doctor. Why
don't you ask him to move
closer to the village!

Lately, my legs have
gotten weaker...
It's causing me a great
deal of trouble.
I would like to go and
have Doctor Uzuki take
a look and see if he
can help me...
But it's a tremendous task
to go up that mountain path
to visit the doctor.
I must be getting old...

That doctor's eccentric!
Why else would anyone
live up on a mountain
peak like that?
He should have moved
closer to the village!
Fei, you're good friends
with the doctor...
Ask him to move closer
to our village for us!

Lately, my legs have been
giving me trouble.
It's really getting to me!
I would like to go and have
Doctor Citan Uzuki take a
look at them and tell me
what's wrong...
But it's a dreadful chore
to climb that mountain path
to visit the doctor.
It must be a sign of my age.

Uuh... Sob...
How could Alice go and get
married...and to that
muscle head, Timothy...!!
I...I've loved her...
since I was a baby...!!
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to live!?

AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHH!! 

Sob... Life...
can be so unfair...

Uh... Sob...
Woe is me...!

Zzzzzz, snore...

Uh, uhn...?
Oh, it's you Fei!
What do you want?

Finally, at my age,
I've become able to
live in peace.
At this rate, I'll
probably live to be
a hundred! Hahahah!

No, no!
Don't waste perfectly
good food like that!

Fei!!
I thought I told you
not to step on my food!

You know you won't come out
in one piece if you try and
pull anything on the bride!

Welcome to the village
of Lah...
Oh, it's you, Fei!?

Oh, don't worry...
We already consider
you a proud member of
the Lahan community!
So, how about finding a
wife and settling down
in our village too?
I'm sure if you live a
peaceful life here your
memory will be bound to
come back one day.

You have a natural ability
to paint and can do martial
arts rather well, I hear!
I bet it's because your body
remembers these things.
You'll be able to breathe
a sigh of relief when your
memory returns to you...
And don't you worry!
I'm sure it will!

Yo, Fei!
Alice has sure
gotten pretty, huh!
Come to think of it...
Alice, Timothy and you
were always together.
I bet you also had a
crush on Alice too, eh?
Am I right? Hahahaha!

Oh, hello there, Fei.
Come to think of it,
it's already been quite
a while since you first
came to our village...
I take it you still
don't remember anything
prior to your coming
here though?
It must be terrible
not knowing your true
identity and all...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being rude...
Please don't take it
the wrong way.

Sorry.
That's all the
Aquasol I have.
But I've got plenty of
my special fertilizer.
Ya want some?
Hahaha!

Oh alright. Here ya go!

Received Aquasol.

Oh yeah, I forgot!
Here's some of my
homemade Aquasol!
I used my special
fertilizer in it so
it should work real
well! Haw-haw-haw!

Received Aquasol.

Hmmm... Oh I'm just
contemplating what I
should plant next.

It's a lot of work just
trying to raise crops.
But it's an excellent
feeling, Fei.
In this great open land,
new life emerges...
I'm not saying we're
doing it.
It's just the earth, 
rain and sun combining 
together to nurture 
these striving new lives.
We're just helping 
them out.

Pumpkinberry...
Applelily... radish...
Hmmm, they all seem
good...

This is the village
consultant's house.
He can teach you
all kinds of things.
Before you step outside
of our village, it might
be wise to stop by here
for some advice first.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Village Consultant's House - Lucca - 0616
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Good day. 
I'm the village consultant.
(But to tell you the truth,
the village chief knows far
more than I do...
However, the chief is an
awfully busy person, so I
have been placed in charge
of answering some of the
more mundane questions.)

As a special for this week,
we are lecturing on the
techniques of "Marshal Art's"
self defense. Wouldn't you
like to learn about it?

What can I do for you today?

    Explain battle commands
    Explain 'Defense' option
    Explain 'Action Points'
    Explain 'Attack' option
    Explain 'Combo' option
    Nothing now, thanks. 

Alright then.
Allow me to explain the
overall battle commands.

During battle, there are two
groups of commands you can
choose from. You can toggle
between groups with the Left
& Right Directional buttons.
The first group includes the
most frequently used Attack,
Defense and Chi options.
The second group contains
special commands such as
Combo, Escape and so forth.
You fight by skillfully
selecting from the two
groups of options the
action that best suits
your circumstances.
Normally, you should be
able to get by with just
the first group of options.
The item option is in both
sets, so you don't have to
switch groups to use items.

...Well, that pretty much
wraps it up. Please come
back again whenever you
need my services.

Oh I see, I see. You wish
to inquire about Defense? 
Well allow me to begin...

By choosing 'Defense', you
can halve the damage your
opponent does to you.
Fighting is not just about
being on the offensive - at
times it pays to hold back.
When you find yourself in a
pinch, it may be a good idea
to leave the attacking up to
your other party members and
simply choose to defend
yourself from enemy attacks.

...Well, that's about it.
Oh, and if you have any
other questions, please
feel free to stop by any
time now, you hear!?

Aha! I knew you were going
to ask me about them! 
Well then, allow me to
explain about Action Points.

There are three kinds of
attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each using
up a set amount of Action
Points when performed.
When all your Action Points
are used up, your turn will
end. Conversely, as long as
you have Action Points left,
you may continue to attack.
In other words, Action
Points represent how many
attacks you can perform in
one turn of combat.
In the beginning, you
will only start out with
3 Action Points. However,
as you increase in level,
your Action Points will
increase accordingly.
The secret in putting up a
good fight lies in how you
utilize your Action Points
- what strengths of attacks
you use, and in what order
you dish them out in...!

...Well, that's it in a
nutshell. Oh, and don't
hesitate to ask if you
have any other queries!

My, you are bold!
Okay then, allow me to
explain to you a little
about attacking.

I am sure that you already
know that there are 3 types
of Attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each of which
uses up a different amount
of Action Points.
The Fierce Attack (<X> button)
uses up 3 points in a single
blow. Hence, if you have only
3 Attack Points, all will be
used up in one Fierce Attack.
The Weak Attack (<T> button)
will use up 1 point per blow.
So, with 3 Attack Points, you
can attack the same enemy 3
times in rapid succession.
The Strong Attack (<S> button)
uses up 2 points per blow.
So, if you've got 3 Attack
Points, you can combine one
Strong Attack with one Weak
Attack to total 3 points.
It is possible to continually
press the <X> button to keep
obliterating enemies in one
Fierce blow, but you may find
out that relying on this will
have repercussions later.

...That's about all I have
to say about that, really.
Please come by again when
you're in need of advice.

Ooooh! The 'Combo' option,
eh? I didn't expect you to
ask about it! Well then,
allow me to explain the
art of the 'Combo'.

When you use the Attack
option, there are times
when you do not use up
all your Action Points.
Such is the case when
you eliminate an enemy
by using only a fraction
of your total points, or
when you cancel midway
through an attack turn.
Action Points which don't
get used are stored in an
'AP Counter'. When this AP
Counter stores up a certain
amount of points, you will
become able to use 'Combos'.
'Combos' are rapid series of
Deathblows let loose all at
one time, and they tend to
be rather ferocious. Any
foe on the receiving end of
a 'Combo' will likely die.
At low experience levels,
you probably won't be able
to do much 'Combo' damage.
But in time you will become
able to do some devastating
'Combo' maneuvers!

...And that's that!
So, if you need any
other advice, you
know where I am!

I see. Well anyway...
feel free to ask me
anything, anytime!

Ahem!
AHEM!

So as not to bother other
clients, please keep all
personal conversations
down to a minimum!

When it comes to fighting
techniques, I tend to be
extremely fussy!
I've started to study up
on them recently...

How 'bout it then?
Wanna hear what I have to say?
    Explain 'Abilities'
    Explain 'Deathblow Skills'
    Explain 'Skill Levels'
    Forget it!

Hmmm, you're pretty
scholarly for a young'un.
Good, now listen up!

That 'Guided Shot' ability
you already have is one of
the many mysterious powers
related to Ether and Chi.
Not everyone has the
talent to use such powers.
People are each born with
differing innate abilities.
If that individual does
have the gift, increasing
in level will give birth
to more powerful abilities.

Hmm. I see a lot of
potential in you.

Good, good.
Ask away young'un!

As you already know, there
are 3 strength levels for
the ordinary Attack option:
Weak   Attack (<T> button),
Strong Attack (<S> button) and
Fierce Attack (<X> button).
'Deathblow Skills' are special
chains of Attacks that first
use some Weak or Strong blows
to knock your foe off balance
and then end with a Fierce
blow to do some major damage!
But first you must master
the use of Weak, Strong
and Fierce Attacks in order
to become able to learn
such 'Deathblow Skills'.
To master these Attacks, you
should keep trying to do, say,
four Weak blows in a row, or
two Strong blows, or even a
Fierce blow accompanied by
another type of blow.
In other words, the way to
learn new 'Deathblow Skills'
is through the frequent use
of various combinations of
the three basic Attacks!

So, whatcha' think?
Doesn't it just make ya want
to go out there now and start
learning those 'Deathblow
Skills' as soon as possible!?

Alright, here we go!
More about Deathblows
and their relation to
Experience Levels...!

If you want to see how
close you are to learning
certain 'Deathblow Skills',
go to the Menu Screen and
then to the Status Screen.
From the Status Screen you
can select 'Skills' to view
a list of your Deathblows,
with meters showing the
percentage learned so far.
If one of the Deathblows
just doesn't seem to be
increasing, then you're
probably using the wrong
types of Attack buttons.
In that case, it might be
best to try those Attacks
you normally haven't been
using. So experiment with
different attack patterns!
But remember this...!
Some 'Deathblow Skills'
cannot be obtained until
you have reached a certain
level of experience!
If you have not attained
that experience level, then
it won't matter even if the
Deathblow's meter has
reached 100%...!
In this case, you will have
to wait until your level of
experience increases before
you will be able to learn
to use that Deathblow!

... And that's about it.
If you keep up in your
studies, you're bound
to go far!

Here you go...
This is an allowance for
being such an enthusiastic
scholar! Hah hah hah!

Received 80G!

Buy some pencils and
books with that, OK!? 
Stick with it, kid!

Oh well... You can never
be too old to study. There
are mountains of things to
learn out there, young'un!

Lucca
Don't tell me!
It's about the
'Memory Cube',
right?

Oh good, good!
You're lucky, you came
just at the right time...
If it's about the 'Memory Cube',
then don't hesitate to ask me.
No one knows better than I do!

How about it then?
Want to hear me out?
    Yeah, okay!
    No, not really!

Alright! Good show!
That's the spirit!
You're pretty smart
for an artist.
Now, open up those
ears and carve every
word I say into that
tiny brain of yours!

I'll begin by explaining
how to save your adventure.
Normally, you can open up
the Menu Screen by pressing
the <S> button. From there
you can select the 'File'
option, and simply follow
the directions to save.
However, when you are in a
town or a dungeon, you can
only save at designated
Memory Cube areas. Without
a Cube you cannot save!

To make a long story short...
This bobbing, spinning thing is
a 'Memory Cube', right!? You
must be cool, calm and collected
to superimpose yourself with it
and boldly open the Menu Screen.
If you accomplish that you will
be able to save successfully.
You should always save without
hesitation whenever you find
one of these in the dungeon.
In life, you can never tell
what may lie around the corner! 

So, what do you think?
You understood everything
perfectly, then!?
Okay, well I gotta...
Wha?
You didn't understand?
Aww gee... Well alright,
let me explain once more!

Alright, this time, make
sure you're listening then!
This spinning and bobbing
thing here is the Memory
Cube I just spoke about.
Fearlessly stand inside of
the Cube's area and calmly
and composedly open up the
Menu Screen! From there you
will be able to save into a
memory file as per normal.
Especially in dungeons and
other like areas, as soon
as you see one of these,
you should save without
hesitation. You never can
tell what may happen next!
When outside on the World
Map, you can save anywhere
you like (... probably)!
If you don't want to wind
up crying later, make sure
you save frequently, okay!?

So, that's it for
my concise summary!
You took it all in this
time, didn't you...?
Well, even a 2 year old
Dongarian Monkey could
understand my fantastic
explanation 120%, right!?

Hooh-ho-ho!
I'm such a genius!!

And now, about the
explanation fee...
Ha-haa! Just kidding...
You didn't think the great
Lucca would be that mean
did you?
This time I'll give you a
special deal and let you
have that one for free!

And you owe me 28G!
Don't forget that, okay!?

Alright, now for the
explanation fee...
it's 28G!
28G is a bargain considering
you were able to receive
such a perfect explanation
from the likes of me!!!
So c'mon, drop the excuses.
Be a man and pay up!

Had 28G taken from you!

Yes, thank you so much...
No receipts given though!

What the...!?
You don't even have 28G?
I guess I have no choice...
You'll have to owe me then.
Don't forget, you now owe
me 28G! You got that, Fei?

Owe Lucca 28G!

What!?
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me, the
one and only great Lucca,
can only do you good...!
... No matter how many
times you listen to it!
Oh, what a waste! Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

What!?
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me, the
one and only great Lucca,
can only do you good...!
... How will you ever know
unless you hear it out!
Oh, what a waste! Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

Oh, and you owe me 28G!
You haven't forgotten
that have you, Fei?
I'm not going to let you
get off so easily if you're
trying to get out of paying
your debt. You got that!?

Did you know that you can
spin the world around with
the L1 and R1 buttons!?
I'm sure you'll see things
you weren't able to before!
Explore the world by using
your own eyes and ears!
That is how you make the
gains in your life truly
your own!
If you're lost, then be
lost! There is no need to
rush, is there? Nor do you
have to explore the world
using someone else's maps!

I come here often to talk
to the village consultant.
He usually gives good advice.
Although, once in a while
he can be a little absent-
minded...
Just recently, he mixed-up
the love potion with the
balding potion...

Hehe... Yes, sir!
Whatever you say!

We'll have to continue
this conversation later!

But then again, we're out

Lahan Village - RPS Guy's House - 0620
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rock!!

Scissors!!

Paper!!

Wife
Sigh... 
My husband's love for the
rock-paper-scissors, or
'RPS' game is ruining us...
Just recently, he even said
he had a dream of receiving
the hero title from the
'RPS King'...
If only someone could
utterly defeat him to
make him see reality...
But he's just so good...

Husband
Yo! You want to play
rock-paper-scissors?
It's 50G per challenge.
    Let's do it!
    No thanks!

What the...?
Ya don't even have 50G!
Come back and talk to me
when ya have money, OK!

Argh... I can't afford
to lose the next turn.
This time I'm getting
serious... Ready?

Tisk... Lost three times
in a row! Not bad, Fei.
But, it's not over yet.

We're just getting started!
Are you ready to 'rock'!?

Yeah, that's the way, Fei!
If ya manage to beat me 5
times in a row, I'll give
ya a special reward!

I need some kind of risk
to make things interesting
against such an amateur.
Hehehe...

Here we go!

One, two...
    Rock
    Scissors
    Paper 

Rock!!

Whoa, you did rock too!?
Not bad! Not bad!
Let's do it again...

Scissors!!

Aww no, rock!?

Darn, you got me!
I can't believe this!
Aarrgh...!!

Paper!!

Rock!?
You did rock?

Muahaha.
Are you serious?
Yesss! I win!!
Ah-hahaha...!!

Rock!!

Scissors!
You did scissors!?

Yesss! I win! 
I did it baby! 
You can kiss my...!!

Scissors!!

Hey, you did scissors too, huh?
Hmmm... So that's how you play?
Anyway, here we go again...

Paper!!

Doh! Scissors?
You did scissors!?

Uuuaaahh! I, I lost!
How could this be!! 
What a snot!

Rock!!

What the!? Paper!?
Paper!?

Me? Lose!? 
This's ridiculous...!
Oh-my-gobrino!

Grraaaaahhh!!
I lost to an amateur!?
M, me...!? MEEEEEEEE...!!

Received 50G.

Guh!? I lost 4 in a row!?
How could I...!?
This is not good!!
If I lose the next one...!!

...
......
It's over...

I give up. I completely
lost to you, Fei.
It just goes to show that
I need more training.

Uuuhh... I give up!
It's my loss, Fei.
Here, as promised
I'll give you this!

Fei received the
'Mythical RPS Hero Badge'!!
Although, no one has any
idea what use it has...

Wife
I see you've beaten my husband!
Well, this should stifle some
of his manic love for the game.
But now I see you've come to
have a passion for RPS too!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scissors!!

Oh, paper!
You did paper!?

Yesss! I win, so pay up!
Hallebalooyah! Boy...
that was too easy!!

Gyahahahaha!! Too bad, Fei!
You're 100 years too early
to even try to win 5 in row!!

Lost 50G.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Paper!!

Oh my, you did paper too.
Hmmm, well I see...
Here we go again...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here...!! Hey! 
You were late!!
You cheezy cheater!!
Only cowards do that.
The penalty's 15G.
C'mon, cough up!

Lost 15G.

Tch! Ya don't even have 15G!
What are ya, a pauper? Boy!

Humph. 
Well, see ya later then.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Elder's Home - 0622
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This town may be hidden
away deep within the
mountains without anything
else... But, I still love
it...Lahan.

Well if it isn't Fei.
Isn't it exciting to know
that Timothy's wedding is
going to be tomorrow?
I think it's time you
found a wonderful girl
like Alice yourself.
Hah hah.

By the way, Fei. What
do you think of Lahan?
    I like it
    I don't dislike it...

Fei
"Lahan...I like it.
The village leader,
Chief Lee, has taken
such good care of me...
Everyone in the village
has warmly accepted
me..."

Fei
"Regardless of where I may
have been born and raised,
Lahan is now my home."

Ah, yes. It makes me
happy to just hear that.

Here, take this as an
allowance. Don't squander
it all at once.

Received 120G!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"I don't dislike Lahan.
The people here are good
people."

Fei
"But, someday, I'd really
like to leave and find my
true home...
To walk upon the land I
was born on, I want to meet
those who've known me...
I want to know who
my true self is."

Fei
"As it is now, it feels
like there's some kinda
empty void within me..."

That's unfortunate.
But I'm sure there are
people out there waiting
for your return...

If the day comes and
that happens, think about
us once in a while and
remember our village.

Fei
"Of course. 
I'd never forget."

But let's forget that
for now. That won't come
along for a while.
It's not good for an elder
like me to be so hasty,
hah hah.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Bar - 0624
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Barkeep
"Aaarh, Fei!
That's the back door!
Go around and come in
through the front door!"

Man
Have you heard the
latest rumors!?
It's said that, in the
southern desert of Aveh
there is buried treasure
all over the place!
There's hundreds of
people who are trying
to strike it rich by
digging everywhere!
A single strike could 
make you totally rich.

But then again, you
never can tell how
much is the truth...
In life, if it sounds
too good to be true,
it usually is. Bah.

Barkeep
"Hey, it's Fei.
How's it going?
I ain't got any drinks
for kids, ya know! 
Come back when you're
older, alright!!?"

Ellen
Oh my! Welcome Fei...
You wanna have some fun?
I give the best service
in Lahan, you know!?

Barkeep
"Hey, Ellen!
Quit teasing the
innocent kid!"

Ellen
Yeah, yeah! I know!
It's just a joke...
you blockhead!

Gee, he's got sharp
hearing! Anyway...
(Maybe next time, okay,
Fei!? I'll be waiting...
Rowrrr!)

Barkeep
"Here's a tip, Fei.
Be very cautious of
alcohol and women.
Behind those sweet and
beautiful appearances
lies a deep, dark swamp.
Before you realize it,
you are trapped, and
lose your freedom.
They are the most
fearsome demons
in this world."

Old Man
Hmmm...!!
Young one, beware!
I can see it...
There is a dark and
icy wind that blows
where you are going.
A wind that nurtures
grief and resentment,
inviting death from
which there is no
salvation...
No one will be able
to escape from it!
But you, and only you,
must eventually face
up to that dark wind!

... Just kidding!
I've always wanted
to try saying that!
Did I scare you?
I'm really sorry!
Wahaha...

But in reality, these
premonitions of misfortune
tend to take on their own
shape once uttered.
You ought to be
prepared...
... Hah hah! Just kidding!
It's also a joke!
Don't let it get to you.

Instead of believing
what others say, you
should follow your
own path.
After all, your
fate will be what
you make of it.

But, do you want to hear
my prediction again? Eh?
    Yeah, from the top!
    No, enough already!

Oh good!
That's the spirit!
Well, here goes...
Are you ready?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How boring.
A guy like you will
never be popular.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gramps always makes
things out to be
easier than they
really are!
It's actually quite
a tremendous feat
to get through that
Blackmoon Forest...
All those dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
live there...
I tell you, it's
better if you don't
go near the place!

South of here is the
'Blackmoon Forest'.
If you can make it through
there, you'll come to Aveh,
the great land of fire!
I shouldn't be wasting my
time here in this little
country village.
Why, I oughta go to Aveh
and work there...!
Beautiful women and good
liquor...
And if I work hard enough,
I'll be rich in no time!
Hehehe...
Wouldn't that be good!

Pay no attention to
the fool!
He's always saying all
this carefree stuff.
In reality, it's an
incredibly hard task
to get through the
Blackmoon Forest...
Lots of dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
make their home there!
It'd be better for
you to stay away
from there!

If you get through the
'Blackmoon Forest' to
the south of here, you
will find the kingdom of
fire, 'Aveh'.
Instead of just wasting
away here in this little
mountain village, I should
go have some fun in Aveh!
Beautiful girls, tasty
liquor...
Why, a gentleman like
myself is bound to draw
the babes wherever I go!
Haw-haw-haw...
Wouldn't that be good!

Drunk Man
You gotta problem with
me, hic, drinkin' at
midday? How can I not be
drinkin'... Damn it...

Nobody knows...
In the depths...
of the sea...
a tear...drop...
shed by...
a mermaid...
It's not some dream...
You idiots...
Hic...

You got a problem, boy?
    No... Go, go, go for it!!
    Yeah... I hate drunks!
    Drinking won't help matters!

Hya hah hah...
I like you, boy! Now go
away and leave me alone.

Hah!
The feeling's mutual...
I hate nosy people!
Since we both hate each
other, why don't you just
leave me alone then, eh?

Shut up! 
What would you know!?
You don't know how I
feel. I wouldn't want
you to know. Damn it...

No...
Wait up, boy!

I'll give you this.
Take it.

Fei
"???
What is that?"

I have no use for it...
Don't worry 'bout it.
Just take it.

Nobody knows...
In the depths...
of the sea...
a tear...drop...
shed by...
a mermaid...

Received a 'Mermaid Tear'!

Fei
"Hmmm...
Well, whatever."

Fei
"Well then,
thanks for this."

Young Man
My, that drunk had the
most beautiful stone!
Hmmm...
I wonder what it was?

There he goes again...
How could there be a
mermaid in the middle
of the sea of sand?

Fei
"Sea of sand...?"

Young Man
What's this, Fei?
You've never seen
the sea of sand?
This is what the
sea of sand is...
It's a vast, swirling,
bottomless desert.
More than half the world
is this sea of sand.
I'm surprised you haven't
heard anything about it.

Lahan Village - Bar Upstairs - 0626
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't need anything
else if I could only live
together with my family.
Just the three of us...
Why can't men understand
something so simple...

...sigh...

...I wonder how
he's doing...
Aveh's so far...
...
...sigh...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Outside Alice's House - 0618
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why, hello Fei.
Are you here
to see Alice?

Actually, it's customary
that we don't let any men
in to see the bride today...
But, you can be an exception.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Alice's House - 0628
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alice's Aunt
"Why hello, Fei. Have you
come to visit our Alice?
She's upstairs right now.

Alice's Aunt
"But doesn't time fly...?
It has already been ten
years since my brother
and his wife passed away.
We did our best to raise
the two children in their
place..."

Alice's Aunt
"But now, as far as
Alice is concerned,
I can finally say my
job is done.
I know Timothy will
take good care of
her from here on...
Now all that's left
is Dan...
I'm going to have a
hard time raising
him to adulthood."

Sigh...

Alice's Aunt
"Tomorrow, please pray
for Alice's happiness.
And, from here on as well,
I want you to stay the best
of friends with both Alice
and Timothy. Thanks, Fei!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lahan Village - Alice's Room - 0630
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Hello, Alice.
Is that your
wedding dress?"

Alice
"Oh!?
Fei, you startled me!"

Alice
"Yes it is...
I just finished it. It took
more work than I expected."

Fei
"Hmmm...
You did a great job there!
It'll look wonderful
on you, Alice...
Congratulations."

Alice
"Thank you.
..."

Alice
"..."

Fei
"Hey, uh, Alice..."

Alice
"Oh, um, Fei..."

Fei
"What is it?"

Alice
"Oh, nothing..."

Fei
"I see..."

Alice
"Um...
Oh yes, that's right..."

Alice
"Fei, 
have you seen Dan?"

Fei
"Yeah, he's outside...
bragging as always."

Alice
"Ugh, that kid!
I just told him that I had
an errand for him to run!"

Fei
"Oh yeah?
What kind of errand?"

Alice
"It's for my wedding
ceremony tomorrow...
I was hoping he could go
borrow a camera and some
lights from Doctor Uzuki,
up on the mountain peak."

Fei
"If that's all it is,
I'll be glad to do it
for you."

Alice
"Could you?
Oh, but I couldn't
possibly..."

Fei
"Don't worry!
It's no problem!
Anyway, it doesn't exactly
make me feel comfortable
having Dan handle such
delicate instruments.
What's more, I might have
a chance to eat some of
Yui's cooking if I go to
the doc's place."

Alice
"Hee-hee...
That's my Fei!"

Fei
"Well, I'll go up there
now and get them for you!"

Alice
"Oh...
Fei, wait!"

Fei
"Huh...? Is there
something else you want
me to get from Citan?"

Alice
"No...
It's not that..."

Fei
"... ?"

Alice
"Fei...
Have you ever thought
about things this way?"

Alice
"If... If, you had
only been born in
this village...
And if we had only
known each other
earlier on..."

Fei
"..."

Alice
"...
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm sorry..."

Fei
"...
Well, I think I had
better get going now!"

Alice
"Oh, OK...
Be careful on that
mountain path.
And give my regards
to Doctor Uzuki!"

Alice
"...
Is this fate...?"

Alice
"I feel so foolish...
Who am I kidding?"

Mountain Path Daytime - 0636
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Doc Uzuki's house
is over the bridge
and up to the north."

Young Boy
Oh, it's you Fei!!

The cliff's edge collapsed from
the heavy rain we had recently.
You're alright Fei, you can do
a big jump to get across it...
But I'm too scared...
    Hey, what's a big jump?
    It's easy, watch me!!

How could you forget...?
A big jump is done by
pressing the <T> button
while running with the
<C> button held down.
You can jump much further
than with a regular jump.
...Fei, you never have
any problems.
It's not fair.

Say hello to the
Doctor for me!

That'a boy Fei...!
Champion of the 12th Lahan
Village Jumping Tournament!

Found a bird nest!!

Take the egg?
    Of course!!
    No, that's cruel!

Received a nutritious
    'bird egg'!!

Cheep, cheep!!!
(Return the egg!!)
    OK, I give it back!!
    No way, never!!

Fei
"Ouch!
Sorry, I'll
give it back!"

Cheep, cheep, cheep!
(Good! You got the hint!)

No way!

Caught a 'spider'!

This way: Walking course.
  Watch out for the cliffs!!
That way: Doctor's house.
  ...Right after the bridge.

This way to Doctor
Citan Uzuki's house!

Fei
"Alright!
Let's go!"

Yui
"Oh, welcome, Fei.
What brings you
here today?"

Fei
"Well,
nothing in particular..."

Yui
"I see...
Well, anyway, please
make yourself at home."

Midori
"..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yui
"Oh Fei, welcome."

Fei
"Hello, Yui.
Where's doc...?"

Yui
"My husband is tinkering
with his junk out in the
backyard."

Fei
"I should have guessed!
Doesn't he ever get sick of
playing with that stuff!"

Fei
"Well, okay then, I'll go
out into the backyard and
see if I can find him."

Fei
"Oh, I nearly forgot!
Yui, I found this on
the mountain path...
Please use it to make
a tasty egg dish for
doc and Midori."

Yui
"Oh, what a nutritious
looking egg! Thank you.
I'll use it for dinner."

Gave the egg you worked
so hard for to Yui.

Fei
"Hi, Midori.
It's a nice day
to play outside.
How about we feed
the birds later?"

Midori
"..."

Fei
"Where are you, doc?"

Fei
"W, what's going on?"

Citan
Ohhh! This is no good!
Why do they use such
inferior parts?
This is why their
intervention strat...

Fei
"Doc!!
So that's where
you were!"

Citan
"Oh, Fei!
Good to see you."

Fei
"Are you alright, doc?
What are you doing all
the way up there?"

Citan
"I thought I would try to
restore this Land Crab.
Oh, and that explosion was
nothing to worry about.
It happens all the time.
Ha, ha, ha...!"

Citan
"Could you wait a while?
I am just about ready
to call it a day.
Oh, yes. There is
something interesting
in the storeroom...
Why not take a look!?"

Fei
"Okay, doc, I will.
But please hurry up.
It will get dark
before you know it."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallen Shadows - Citan's Workshop - 0648
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"So this is what doc
was talking about.
Let me see...
what's so interesting
about it..."

Wow!?

Fei
"W, what is this...?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Soundtrack - A Distant Promise
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"This music...?
I've heard it before
somewhere...?"

Citan
What do you think?
Not bad, huh?

Fei
"Doc..."

Citan
"Hello again Fei. Sorry
to have kept you waiting."

Citan
"Music is a mysterious
thing...
Sometimes, it makes people
remember things that they
do not expect.
Many thoughts,
feelings, memories... 
things almost forgotten...
Regardless of whether
the listener desires to
remember them or not..."

Fei
"Doc, what is this...?"

Citan
"It was excavated from
some old ruins, and is
still under repair.
Obviously it is an audio
device of some type."

Citan
"Long ago people would
listen to this melody,
just as we are doing now...
At times they would have
been cheered up...
While at times they would
have been made to cry."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"By the way, what brings
you here today?"

Fei
"Oh yeah, that's right!
Alice asked me to borrow
some camera equipment
from you."

Citan
"Oh yes. 
Her wedding is
tomorrow, right...?"

Citan
"Understood.
Well, we had better
get them ready then."

Citan
"Oh, and dinner should be
ready soon. Would you like
to join us?"

Fei
"Would I ever!
I was hoping
you would ask."

Citan
"I still have some
cleaning up to do
out here.
Would you mind giving
Midori some company
back in the house?"

Fei
"Okay.
Take your time, doc.
I'll go ahead and eat
when dinner is ready!"

Citan
"Ha, ha, ha.
Go right ahead.
But, I will not be held
responsible if you get a
stomachache from eating
my wife Yui's cooking."

Fei
"Doc...
I feel strange when I
listen to this music...
I feel something warm
inside..."

Citan
"That just may be because
you have someone living
inside of you...
... And he too must have
liked this music a long
time ago before he became
a part of you...

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Is Timothy and Alice's
wedding really tomorrow...
It might actually be
better to live an ordinary
life, in this condition...
As a son of man..."

Citan
"Well, anyway. I suppose
I had better adjust the
gyro at least..."

Citan
"Huh....!?"

Citan
"This cannot be...
Is...is this...
an omen...?"

Citan
"...
Now, what is going
to happen...?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallen Shadows - Citan's House - Dinner - 0644
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Mmmm!
That was good!"

Fei
"Your cooking never
fails to impress me,
Yui!"

Fei
"Thank you for such
a delicious meal!"

Yui
"You're welcome.
If you like my cooking
that much, then I'd be
happy to cook for you
anytime, Fei!"

Yui
"Oh, and the bread tasted
really good because I used
that egg you brought us."

Fei gained a bit of weight,
but felt he did a bad thing.
... Well, just a little bit!

Citan
"I will bring the equipment
you need to the village
tomorrow morning, myself...
It does not exactly make me
feel comfortable to have
you handle such delicate
instruments, I am afraid!"

Fei
"...
Where have I heard
that line before!?"

Fei
"That's alright by me...
Well, see you tomorrow, doc!
Good night, Yui, Midori!"

Yui
"Good night.
We're looking forward
to tomorrow's wedding."

Midori
"..."

Yui

Be careful now, Fei!"

Citan
"Yes, good night."

Citan
"Oh, Fei!
Please be careful..."

Citan
"Ah, I mean...
the path is dangerous
when it is so dark..."

Fei
"What's wrong, doc?
There is nothing to worry
about! Well, anyway, I'll
see you tomorrow."

Citan
"Good night, Fei.
And do be careful!"

Fei
"What's that...?"

Fei
"Giants...?"

Citan
Fei!!

Fei
"Doc!
Some flying objects
went toward Lahan!!"

Citan
"So you saw them too!
Judging by their shadows,
they appear to be a group
of Gears from our neighbor
country, Kislev."

Fei
"Those were...
Gears...?"

Citan
"!!
Oh no! They are headed
directly for Lahan!" 

Fei
"The ones I just saw?"

Citan
"Let us make haste!"

Fei
"Right!"

Fei
"No!
Lahan's...!?"

Citan
"Alice!?
Timothy!!"

Alice
"Doctor Uzuki!?
Fei!!"

Timothy
"Doctor! They just came
outta nowhere and landed
right in our village...!"

Citan
"I know. What on earth
are they doing starting
a battle here...!?
Are you all okay?"

Alice
"Yes!
But it's Dan...
We can't find him!!"

Timothy
"I'll go look one more
time! Alice, go ahead and 
get out of the village."

Citan
"No, Timothy, wait!!
You, Alice and the
rest of the villagers
should evacuate to a
safer location!"

Timothy
"Doc, you know I
can't just leave
Dan behind!"

Alice
"Timothy..."

Citan
"I understand how you feel,
but leave the rest up to
Fei and me!
The primary thing you
should be concerned with
is your own safety...
Timothy, your
responsibility is
to protect Alice!"

Timothy
"...
But..."

Fei
"It's just as doc says.
The two of you should get
out of the village now!
Don't worry about Dan.
Knowing him, he has
already evacuated and
is waiting for you!"

Timothy
"...
I guess you're right..."

Timothy
"Okay! Alice, let's let
Doctor Uzuki and Fei
handle it from here!"

Alice
"...
Yes, okay.
Thank you, Doctor!"

Alice
"But, Fei...
Please look out for Dan!"

Fei
"Yeah, don't worry.
If he still happens to be
in the village, I'll be
sure to save him!"

Citan
"Now, both of you,
hurry!!"

Citan
"I will go check inside
the houses to see if there
is anyone left behind.
Fei, please go around
the village and guide
the stragglers to a
safe location!"

Fei
"Alright!
But doc...
You be careful, okay!!?"

Citan
"You too, Fei!"

Fei
"Whoa!!"

Fei

Ah...!?"

This is not good!

Citan
"Are you alright!? 
What on earth are
you doing here!?
Do you not know
how worried Alice
and Timothy are!?"

Dan
"I'm sorry Doctor Uzuki!
I got out of the village
earlier, but I came back...
... I just couldn't bear
to think of leaving my
sister's wedding dress
behind here..."

Citan
"You returned to
save your sister's
wedding dress...!?"

Citan
"Heh...
You are such a sentimental
little boy...!"

Citan

"Oh, you have finally
gained consciousness,
Fei..."

Fei
"Doc...
What happened...?
Where's Chief Lee,
Timothy, Alice...?
What did I...?"

Citan
"Yes...
Well that is..."

Dan
"You murderer!!"

Citan
"Dan!"

Fei
"...!?
Dan,
what do you mean...?"

Dan
"Fei..."

Dan
"It...was because you
had to go get in that
monster...
Alice and Timothy...
The people of the
village are all...!!"

Dan
"You killed everyone
using that monster...!!"

Fei
"...!?"

Townspeople
Why did you have to
fight in the middle
of the village...?

How do you even know
how to operate such
a monster...?

Mother...?
Where mother...?

See, I told you so...
I said allowing someone
we knew nothing about
into our village would
spell disaster...

Owww...
Hurts...It hurts...

Fei
"Dan...!!
E, everyone...
I...!"

Yikes...!

No! Keep away...
I'm scared...

Waaaaaaahhh...

Dan
"Murderer!!
My sister...
Give me back my sister!!"

Citan
"Dan...
There is nothing to be
gained from putting the
blame all on Fei alone.
What is more, you know
Fei had no control over
the malfunction of that
Gear.

Dan
"I...
I know that!"

Dan
"But...
But...!!

Dan
"I HATE YOU!!"

Dan
"Uuuaaaaaaahhhhh...!!"

Fei
"Dan...!?"

Citan
"It might be better if
we left him by himself
for a little while...
He does not know what
to do with his grief,
his anger..."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"And Fei...
It may be a good idea for
you to leave this place.
There is no guarantee
that reinforcements from
yesterday's unit are not
going to come...
They will probably want
to know what happened
to their comrades.
Also, if you stay here, I
do not think the atmosphere
is going to be very joyful
...if you know what I mean.
It is probably best for
both you and all the
other villagers here.

Fei
"I guess you're right...
This disaster happened
because I was here..."

Fei
"But...what am I
supposed to do now...?"

Citan
"Yes, well... Why not go
through the Blackmoon
Forest and head for Aveh?
I am sure those soldiers
from yesterday were not
from Aveh.
If you can manage to get
to the Aveh side, they
will not be able to track
you down very easily."

Fei
"Okay...
I understand, doc..."

Fei
"Well anyway... Please
take care of the rest of
the things here, doc."

Citan
"Of course...
Well, do take care now."

Fei
"..."

You killed everyone with
that monster...!!

Murderer!! My sister...
Give me back my sister!!
Now, Fei, allow me to
spill the blood out of
love...Like the sea of
hell, red, deep...!

"Gh...!!"

"I have orders to kill all

I come in contact with...
It's part of my mission.
It's nothing personal."

"I have a question for you.
...How do I get out of this
forest?"

Fei
"Are you...lost?"

Mysterious Woman
"Just answer my question!
How do I get out of here?"

Fei
"Sorry...
but I'm looking for the
way out of here too."

Mysterious Woman
"Oh..."

Fei
"How long are you
just going to stand
there like that?
If you're going to
shoot me, then hurry
up and do it."

"What an odd thing to say!
Don't you understand the
situation you are in?"

"I don't care about
my situation...
I'm just a guy whose
life is worthless...
There's no point in
me living anyway!"

Fei
"How are you feeling?"

Fei
"Do you still intend to
kill me? Then go right
ahead and shoot me!
But you'd better not do it
while we're in this forest.
Forest monsters hate loud
noises, you know!?"

Mysterious Woman
"..."

Fei
"Fine.
Don't talk to me if
you don't want to...
But it wouldn't kill
you to thank me for
tending your wounds."

!

Mysterious Woman
"Th...thanks...
but you shouldn't
have helped me.
Don't think it will
save your life though.
It really doesn't
change a thing."

Fei
"What are you
so afraid of?"

Mysterious Woman
"I'm not afraid...
I'm just being cautious.
It's natural for me to be
this cautious considering
I've met such a suspicious
surface dwelling -Lamb-."

Fei
"Hm... Don't you worry.
I'm not gonna do anything.
Besides you're much more
suspicious than I am."

Mysterious Woman
"Huh...?"

Fei
"So, what's your name?"

Mysterious Woman
"I won't give my name to
a surface dweller -Lamb-."

Fei
"What's with you and
this 'Lamb' thing?
We're both lost in this
forest, surrounded by
dangerous monsters...
Shouldn't we at least
be cooperating with
each other until we
get out of here?"

Mysterious Woman
"..."

Fei
"Good.
So what's your name?
It's going to be hard for
us to cooperate with one
another without at least
knowing each other's names.
Anyway, my name is
Fei Fong Wong.
You can call me Fei."

Mysterious Woman
"I'm...Elhaym.
But my parents
call me Elly."

Fei
"'Elly', huh?
Somehow I already
'knew' that."

??

Fei
"Anyway, it's too dangerous
to travel in these parts
this late at night...
Let's wait till daybreak
before we continue looking
for a way out of here...
If that's okay with you?"

Elly
"I guess we have
no choice, do we?"

"Okay then Elly...
How about having
something to eat."

Elly
"Fei..."

Elly
"Yesterday you said your
life was worthless. What
did you mean by that?"

Fei
"Why are you asking?"

Elly
"Why? Yesterday you looked
like you had a death wish.
You think it wouldn't make
me wonder...? Say, how did
you get stranded in this
forest in the first place?"

Fei
"I should ask you
the same question."

Elly
"Huh? Well,
I, errh..."

Fei
"I...ran away...
from my village...
or what's left of it..."

Elly
"Village...?
You don't mean...!?"

Fei
"Lahan...
It was a small village that
existed between this forest
and the mountain range.
I ran away from there."

Elly
"That village...?"

Fei
"It was a nice, peaceful
village. Everyone there
treated me like family.
Then, last night, a group
of Gears suddenly appeared
and started fighting right
in the middle of the place.
The village was engulfed in
flames... I couldn't just
stand there and watch
Lahan be destroyed...
So to try and save the
villagers, I got in an
empty Gear...without even
knowing how to operate it.
I just thought maybe I
could do it...no...it
was more like someone
whispering to me...
Someone whispering to me...
telling me to do it...
But it was a disaster!
The village..."

Elly
"Was it destroyed by
the Kislev army?"

Elly
"Fei...?"

Fei
"No... The village was
destroyed...by me..."

!?

Fei
"Yes. It was me.
I destroyed Lahan.
I'm sure of it..."

Elly
"What do you mean
you destroyed it?
I thought you were
trying to help save
the villagers?"

Fei
"I did try to help.
I actually took out
a few Gears.
But then I came under
heavy fire from a new
group of Gears...
And then my friend...
Timothy...was hit by
a hail of bullets...
Then I lost it...
Everything just went
dark..."

Fei
"I don't remember anything
after that.
The Gear I was in went out
of control...
Well, that's what doc said.
When I came to...
the village...
and everyone in it...
was...
Alice... She was such a...
Alice and Timothy...
Oh god...! Everybody...
All such good people..."

Elly
"Went out of control...?
The Gear...?
What about the village?"

Elly
"Fei?"

Fei
"...Yes, the Gear!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"If they had never come
to the village, never
started fighting there...
Then I wouldn't have
tried to pilot that Gear.
It's all their fault...
Not mine!
They're the ones to blame.
If they'd never come...
none of this would have...
...if not for them!"

Fei
"Them!
Them!!
Them!!!"

Elly
"Enough of that!"

!?

Elly
"You're a coward!"

Fei
"A coward?
...Me?"

Elly
"Yes, you're a coward.
All you're saying is
'them, them, them'.
Don't talk as if you
had no part of the
blame, as well!"

Fei
"I'm to blame...?"

Elly
"Yes, that's right!
Of course the direct cause
of the battle was that a
Gear made an emergency
landing in your village.
But all Kislev wanted was
the Gear, right?
They weren't invading or
out to destroy Lahan.
The real damage occured
because you climbed in a
Gear and tried to fight
back!"

Fei
"..."

Elly
"What ever made you get
into that Gear?
Not just anyone can pilot
them! It takes training!
There is no way a civilian
could hope to pilot one!
Besides...you should have
been helping the villagers
flee to safety instead!
How can you blame the
damage on a Gear when it
was your decision to fight
in it in the first place?
Why don't you take some of
the responsiblity yourself?
Why are you putting all the
blame on others?
That's just running away!
That's what makes you a
coward!"

Fei
"Well, if you put it that
way... Yes...that's right,
I am a coward!
I didn't realize my own
strength and have been
blaming what happened as a
result of that on others.
I'm a pitiful excuse for a
man.
But...
I just felt this rush of
blood in me and I couldn't
help myself! Couldn't help
myself...or help others."

Elly
"Fei, I, I'm..."

Fei
"Shut up!!
What do you know!?
When I came to I was
surrounded by piles
of rubble...
I didn't know what had
happened or what I had
done. I remembered
absolutely nothing.
All I knew was that my
hands could still feel
what they had done.
The only things that
penetrated the Gear's
barrier were screams...
Screams accompanied by
the stench of blood, the
sound of crushing bones,
and my own curses.

Look! Look at my hands!
Can you hear their voices?
Can you understand this
feeling?
The feeling of having
destroyed your village
with your own hands...?
Of not being able to do
anything for the children
left behind...?
Now they have nothing...
I have nothing...
I have nowhere...
no one..."

Fei
"I didn't want to get in
it... I had no choice...
There was no other way..."

say that to him...?"

Girl in Forest - Anime Cutscene - Elly's Nightmare
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"You talk as if it's not your responsibility!"

"No! I didn't do anything!"

"They died because you had to 
pilot the gear and start fighting!"

"It wasn't me, can't you understand!?"

"Not just anyone can pilot those machines you know!"

"I didn't do it!"

"...Why won't you take responsibility!?"

"I'm not so strong..."

"Why are you trying to put the blame on others!?"

"I'm not even all that talented..."

"You're a coward!" 

Fei
"That's right, I'm a coward!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"Yes...
that's right...
I am a coward..."

Fei
"Elly!
Are you alright?!
Darn!
She's unconscious!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Fe~i!"

Citan
"Fei! I have been
searching for you!
Here, You can use this!"

Fei
"Hey! Hold on a second!
To tell me I can use
it is one thing..."

Fei
"Elly...
Damn it!"

Fei
"Doc.
I have a favor to ask!
I will defeat this
monster!
But, if it looks like
I'll go out of control
like last time,
then shoot me!"

Citan
"Fei...
Let us pray that
that won't happen!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Broken Silence - Blackmoon Forest - Post Rankar Fight
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Fei!
Are you alright?"

Fei
"Yeah...I guess so."

Citan
"That fight with the
Rankar was remarkable.
An ordinary Gear could
not defeat that monster.
And you certainly keep
yourself in good shape..."

Fei
"Why did you bring
this here, doc?"

Citan
"This...?
You mean Weltall?"

Fei
"...Weltall?
This is the Gear that
destroyed our village.
Why did you bother
bringing it here?
I never want to see
another Gear again..."

Citan
"I understand how
you must feel...
But, in order to
protect yourself
you need a certain
degree of strength.
Even more since we
are being pursued."

Fei
"I agree that a certain
degree of strength is
needed for self-defense.
And if it weren't for this
Gear here, Elly and I'd be
in that Rankar's stomach
right now...
But its power goes beyond
what is necessary. Does
one really need the power
to destroy everything?"

Citan
"..."

Fei
"I don't need that
kind of power...
I just hate Gears."

Citan
"Fei, using power or being
used by power...is that not
a problem of the heart...?
If humans do not use their
power for wrong it can be
a good thing...I believe
such power can help us.
In that respect, I know
you will be fine.
It sure helped you out
this time.
Am I right?"

Fei
"I want to believe that.
But something is holding
me back. This Gear..."

Fei
"Well, whatever...
At least Elly is
safe now."

Citan
"She seems to
have come to."

Elly
"Huh...?"

Citan
"I am Citan...
a friend of Fei's.
You almost did not make it.
If Fei had not have helped
you, I hate to think what
may have happened.
But I was not too pleased
with his rashness in trying
to take on that Rankar
with just his bare fists."

Elly
"Bare fists?"

Citan
"Well, I am glad that you
were able to find a use
for what I brought you."

Elly
"!!"

Citan
"Let us just say we are
borrowing what the Kislev
army left behind..."

Elly
"...Oh."

Elly
"Thank you, Fei.
This makes twice."

Fei
"Don't mention it.
I'll just put it
on your tab."

Citan
"It is getting dark.
Let us make camp now and
start out early tomorrow.
The both of you look tired
and I need to make some
repairs on our friend
here..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Broken Silence - Blackmoon Forest night by campfire - 0658
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"It is no use. The knee
actuator and bypass
circuit are both ruined.
The actuator can be fixed,
but the circuit needs 
to be replaced..."

Citan
"Oh, having trouble
sleeping there?"

Elly
"Yeah..."

Citan
"I imagine you would.
You have had quite a day."

Citan
"This is the machine Fei
used when the village was
attacked.
There was another machine
left sitting on the
outskirts of the village...
Nil bayer dars legus?
(It was yours, right?)"

!

Citan
"Just as I thought...
The missing pilot from the
Gear that made an emergency
landing in Lahan...
...and the mysterious woman
found wandering lost in the
forest...are actually one
and the same person.
Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the military...
Am I correct?"

Elly
"How...?
Who are you?"

Citan
"I checked the ID tags of
of the soldiers who died
in the attack on Lahan...
The design on their tags
and the design on your
uniform there is the same."

!

Citan
"Do not worry, they were
given proper burials.
But, they may not have
been too pleased to die
in a foreign land."

Elly
"...Maybe."

Citan
"Does Fei know 
about you?"

Elly
"I don't think he
has realized yet."

Citan
"Most likely...
Fei knows nothing of the
world outside of Lahan."

Elly
"I see...
So how come..."

Citan
"...In any case, it is best
if we do not pry into each
other's pasts anymore."

Elly
"But..."

Citan
"Let us just say that I
know a little more about
the world than most do."

Citan
"Anyway, Elly...
I have a favor I must
beg you to do..."

Elly
"...What is it?"

Citan
"Go straight ahead and
you will come to a road.
Then just keep going...
Would you please leave us
while Fei is still asleep?"

!?

Citan
"Unfortunate things keep
happening around Fei.
I would like to protect
him if possible...
I do not want him caught
up in any vain struggles.
I am also saying this for
your benefit.
Elly, you do not belong
here.
Go back to your family."

Elly
"Um...I..."

Citan
"Do not worry.
I will not tell Fei what
your true identity is.
I will...just tell him
you went to meet up
with your family..."

Elly
"No, it is not that!
I did something
terrible to him...
So...I want to...
apologize."

Citan
"Something terrible?"

Elly
"Fei told me it was
our fault your village
was destroyed.
Fei kept saying...
 'if only they
  hadn't come...'
Then, I called Fei a
coward because he was
trying to escape from
the responsibility...
But in fact it was
me who was trying to
escape from taking
the blame..."

Elly
"If I hadn't crash-landed
there, they would all still
be living peacefully now.
All those innocent people
wouldn't have been caught
up in that tragedy.
But I accused Fei..."

Citan
"You are a rarity. I did
not expect your people
would ever think like that.
To your people, surface
dwellers are nothing more
than domesticated animals,
are they not...?"

Elly
"'The Shepherds, -Abel-,
  took control over the
  surface dwelling -Lambs-
  ...possessing the right
  to give life and death
  unto them as they see
  fit...'"

Citan
"Exactly. Yet you seem to
feel responsiblity toward
Fei and the villagers.
Why is that?"

Elly
"I don't know myself...
At Jugend I was taught
that surface dwellers
were stupid and base...
...And that is why we
have to control them...
But..."

Citan
"But upon meeting Fei,
something about him made
you feel differently?"

Elly
"Yes. He's no different
than we are...in fact he
seemed more powerful.
He possesses something...
...something we don't.
He also risked his life
to save me...twice."

Citan
"Most of your people
would feel ashamed at
receiving such an act.
Yet, you are grateful
to Fei...?"

Elly
"It's probably because of
my father. He had an open
mind to surface dwellers.
My nanny was...a surface
dweller. No one knew about
her though...
Besides...
I am the same as Fei..."

Citan
"The same?"

Elly
"No, nothing. 
Nevermind..."

Citan
"Hmm. I think I understand.
I am sorry. After just
saying we should not pry...
It is my nature, you know?
My wife says I am too
persistent and that I
talk too much.
But, personally, I do not
think I talk too much."

Citan
"It is probably best
if you return home
to your country.
You really should
not be here."

Elly
"I'll return to
headquarters.
But then what..."

Citan
"You are worried..."

Elly
"Yes..."

Citan
"Worrying is natural...
 'Even I used to worry
  once too, you know!?'"

Elly
"Oh, Citan..."

Citan
"Anyway, let me handle
what to tell Fei...
You had better go now."

Path to Aveh - Blackmoon Forest Clearing - 0654
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Has Elly gone yet?"

Citan
"Oh, so you were awake?"

Fei
"Yes, I woke up midway, so
I only heard part of what
you two were discussing."

Citan
"..."

Fei
"Elly...
so that's what she is?"

Citan
"Fei, she is..."

Fei
"I know. 
It's not Elly's fault.
What happened to the
village is all my fault.
I took out all my pent up
feelings on Elly. I'm the
one who should apologize."

Citan
"Fei, do not blame 
yourself. It was not 
your fault either.
You were just trying to
protect the village."

Fei
"Thanks, doc...
By the way, how is everyone
from the village going?"

Citan
"Do not worry, Yui is
taking care of them.
I told her to leave soon
and take them all to a
certain place.
They should be safe for a
while. So you just worry
about yourself for now."

Fei
"Okay, doc."

Citan
"Now to think what we
should do next...
Shall we leave this forest
and head for the desert
town of Dazil?
We may learn what Aveh and
Kislev are up to...
not to mention getting some
parts for Weltall.
The leader of Aveh is not
going to sit back and let
the other night's fiasco
go by unpunished!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

?

Fei
"What is that...?"

Citan
"I would assume it is
an aerial battleship
from Aveh..."

Fei
"An aerial battleship?
I've never heard of Aveh
having anything like that."

Citan
"Of course it does
not come from Aveh
originally...
Most likely it belongs
to the Gebler forces
stationed in Aveh."

Fei
"Gebler?"

Citan
"Special forces from the
Sacred Empire of Solaris
known as Gebler.
I am sure you have heard
something about them.
They are an organization
providing large scale
military aide to the
Kingdom of Aveh.
They showed up in Ignas
several months ago.
Until then, Aveh was
being routed by Kislev.
But with Gebler's help
they have managed to
regain half their loses.
They are now expanding
their territory and
gathering resources
buried in the ruins."

Fei
"I've heard the village
elders talk about it...
Is Elly a part of that?"

Citan
"Quite possibly so.
Their group has superior
technology and power.
It is rumored they are
here solely to get the
resources in the ruins.
I am surprised they are
using something as
powerful as that ship...
It must be to supress the
recent border skirmishes."

Fei
"So they are fighting
the Kislev Empire?"

Citan
"Yes. It seems they have
found new ruins on the
northern edge of Aveh.
Those ruins are under a
five-hundred-year-old
temple.
Three weeks ago Kislev
took over those ruins.
Most likely they are
fighting over that."

Dazil - Town of Dazil - 0676
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"This is...
Dazil..."

Citan
"Yes, that is right. 
The desert town of Dazil."

Fei
"This town's lively."

Citan
"This is the center for
all excavations in Aveh.
People come from all over
Ignas to try and find the
resources buried in the
ruins around here."

Citan
"We should be able to find
out what both Aveh and
Kislev are up to, here.
And we also have to gather
the things we need to
repair Weltall."

Fei
"Repair Weltall..."

Citan
"Yes. We must exchange
the broken parts to fix
Weltall...
Otherwise it will not be
able to function at all!
There is an 'Ethos'
workshop in the southern
part of this town.
Let us go there, Fei."

Fei
"Yeah, okay doc,
let's check this
place out then."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Entrance Guard
Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

You can't let up
even in peacetime.
We always have to keep 
working hard just in case.

This is the Aveh Army's
Dazil Guard Station.
No civilians allowed.
If you have no business
here, please leave.

This town is the center
of all Gear excavating 
in Aveh.
They take the generators
out of excavated Gear to
make new models.
Protecting this town is
essential to beating Kislev.
I left my family at home 
to come here. 
I want to finish my duty
here and go home.

My friend had family in
Bledavik, so he went back.
That's nice. At least he 
had someone waiting for him.
Me... I'm all alone...
I think I'll just cry
myself to sleep today.

The Kislev army is up
to something in the
land north of here.
But don't worry...
If anything happens,
Gebler will back us up.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"The 'Ethos'? 
What do Gears have to
do with the 'Ethos'?"

Citan
"Only the 'Ethos' has the
technology to maintain
generator driven Gear.
The 'Ethos' decides which
Gear gets which generator
in which country..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"...
Doc, do you have a moment?
I need to talk to you."

Citan
"Yes, of course, Fei..."

Citan
"So Fei, what did you want
to talk to me about?"

Fei
"...
Well doc, it's about
Weltall...
We can't find the parts
we need, so is it alright
if we just don't fix it?"

Citan
"Do not repair it?
What is the problem, Fei?"

Fei
"Well, we've been able to
come as far as Dazil on
our own...
So doesn't that show that
we don't need Weltall
as much as we thought.
Actually, I've been
thinking that once things
cool down I want to go back
to Lahan and help rebuild.
That's all I feel I can
do now..."

Citan
"...I see.
If that is what you want,
Fei, then fine.
But I think we should
try and move Weltall
as far away from there
as possible."

Fei
"Move it away?
But why do we need
to do that, doc?"

Citan
"It is only my
speculation, but...
I suspect the incident that
evening occured because the
Gebler Special Force stole
a Kislev Military Gear."

Fei
"Special Force...
You mean Elly's group?"

Citan
"Exactly.
When I examined the broken
Gear in the village, I
realized the Gebler pilot
was riding a Kislev Gear.
It must have had some new
technology involved in it
for the Kislev army to send
pursuit forces after it."

Fei
"New technology?"

Citan
"I suspect that the Gebler
Force was out to steal a
new experimental Gear."

Citan
"I am sure news of the
Special Force's failure
has reached the capital.
They will be investigating
the Lahan area to reclaim
whatever parts of the new
Gear that they can find."

Fei
"Hold on, doc!
Won't the Kislev army
still be in Lahan too!"

Citan
"Most probably.
And in that case, there
will be a conflict between
Aveh's inspection team and
Kislev's pursuit troops.
If they find where we have
hidden Weltall..."

Fei
"The armies will fight over
who gets Weltall...
And right near Lahan too."

Citan
"So, to avoid any problems,
we should move Weltall
somewhere else right away!"

Fei
"But, we can't fix it
in order to move it..."

Citan
"Right.
But staying here will
solve nothing.
Fortunately, this is the
center of all excavation
work in this country.
There is bound to be some
information on where we
can find parts...
Anyway, the fear is often
worse than the danger
itself... We should not let
such fears hold us back!"

Citan
"This is a sand buggy.
...
That is it, Fei!
I have thought of a good
way to get the parts we
need for Weltall.
Let us go back to the
rental shop and rent out
this buggy."

Fei
"What do you intend
on doing, doc?"

Citan
"Well, leave it to me.
Just you wait and see."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

With that truce with
Kislev, the war is
basically over.
Now our job will be to
protect the people
from desert pirates.

Three weeks ago Kislev
raided the ruins to the
north. They're probably
coming here next.
Be careful if you go 
digging at the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

Feels like the war's over.
Now thing's should get
better. I'm so relieved.

This is the Aveh Guard
station.
This town is important
because it's the base for
excavating the ruins.
The elite of our army 
are stationed here.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

All's clear!

No enemies sighted!

Peace...
The war's not over yet
though.
Still, it's like heaven
compared to when we were
always expecting enemy
attacks.

There's a story floating
around that the Kislev army
is looking for buried Gear.
Be careful if you go
digging in the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

Someone named Sigurd is
in charge until the
change to a republic.
...Do you think a
republic is a good
idea?
Anyway, I'm just glad
that an end to the war
is in sight.

The battle with Kislev the
other day in the desert ended
in a complete victory for us.
We need the army because they
get us generators from the
Gears found in the ruins.
We'll never give this town
or our ruins to Kislev.

There are burglars out
looking for treasure
in the desert ruins!
...Brrr...
...Shivers...!
Oh, I just wet my pants.
You better be careful too.

There's a lotta people
who get lost in the desert
and die of starvation!
...Brrr...
...Shivers...!
Oh, I just pooed my pants.
You better be careful too.

Gee, I wanna
climb up there...

 Welcome! 

I counted on the war so I
bought a lot of stuff...
So what happens to my money
when we become a republic?
I'm gonna get wiped out!

Lately there's rumors of
all out war with Kislev.
I'm gonna stock up while
there're still just small
border skirmishes.

Hmm, the prices are a
little high.
But we need these things
to cross the desert...

Shakhan who had been
ruling this country
has been chased out!
The war with Kislev might
end, and life will be easy
again. I'm so happy.

Since those Gebler forces
came, Aveh's hardly ever
lost to Kislev.
I wish the 'Ethos' would
give out some of those
new powerful Gears.

Hmm, you look tired.
You can stay overnight at
the bar, so why don't you
rest there a little bit?
Travelling all worn and
tired, might just get you
killed.

Hey, why the long face?
Something bad happen?
It's times like this,
you need a drink...
or two, or three...

The army's been sending a
lot of guys down here...
But surely, there has to
be a more efficient way
to excavate those ruins!

I'm in a 'fix'...
The generator sensor
is broken...
It's the only thing
that can sense buried
Gear generators...
Without that, I'm
'ruin'ed!

There's a buncha thieves
out in the desert called
Sandmen... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

There's a buncha pirates
in a sand cruiser out in
the desert... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

Taking excavated parts to
the workshop doesn't pay
so well anymore.
I hear they might downsize
the workshop...times are
tough, I tell ya.

Big profits for little work!
That's the best way to make
money... That's the knack!
We make our money selling
the parts we excavate to
the 'Ethos'.
The rarer the parts, the
better the price!
'Dig it'!?

So...
What do you
want to buy?

lady friend...
Gahahaha!"

Big Joe
"...hic...
You drinkin' too?
Booze is my life companion!
Especially in a sucky
world like this.
Everyone's searching for
dough and dynamite... 
Ha, how unromantic."

Big Joe
"Me?
What am I doing here?
...Whatever I please,
I guess."

Big Joe
"You think you know 
about yourself?
I could introduce myself
right now, and by tomorrow
be a different person.
If you didn't understand
that, I'll repeat...
...Hic!
Don't count your chickens 
before they hatch."

"Shaddap!!"

"...hic..."

Why're you all yappin'
when Big Joe is here
trying to drink in peace?
Can't ya'll shuddup...?
...Hic!

Big Joe
"Gahahahahaha!"

Big Joe
"Yeah, you sure talk big.
Can you dig for treasure
as good as you talk?"

Big Joe
"You're so tough...
Always lookin' for junk 
laying around... Why don't
you do somethin' more
productive for once!?"

Big Joe
"Gahahahaha! 
That's right... Run home 
to momma, little boys!"

Big Joe
"Ha! 
Cowardly little
punks!"

Lately...we haven't
had much luck, have we?

Ha-ha! We did it!

I didn't think it
would go so well...

Follow after the army
excavation teams...

and steal their treasure!

Wahahahahahha.

Who'dya think ya are?
I don't care if you're
Big Joe or Big Shmoe!
You don't mess with me!

What's that ya'say!?

If you ask me, 
You're a big pus--!

Aw, shawdup!
Just shut your trap!

Uwup...!
Da-damn you!
You'll keep!

I'm wondering whether
I should give up this
job some time soon...

Yeah, we did it!

Who'd have thought it?

Sneaking in the night...

Just like that... Poof!

Gyahahahahaha.

Hey, stop it...
This guy's trouble.
He's lookin' wild...

Hicc!

10G a night...
Wanna stay?
    Yes
    No

You don' have enough 
money. Get out!

Fei
"That's amazing.
They're doing digging right
next to this town too?"

Citan
"This is an Aveh-run
excavation site.
The machines and Gears
found here are valuable
resources that could turn
the tide of the war.
They are indispensible
to the war effort."

Citan
"Anyway Fei...
Let us move on.
We have more pressing
matters to do than
taking in the 'sites'!"

Dazil - Waterworks Pump - 0664
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the waterworks.
All of Dazil's water 
comes from this pump.

Water is needed for the
maintenance of Gears.
So our waterworks was
also built to provide a
steady supply of water
to the workshop.

Dazil - Ethos workshop - 0666
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since that disaster happened
to the 'Ethos', they've been
running around like fools...
Now, just getting parts is a
tough enough task.

If requests for repairs
keep coming at this pace,
we won't be able to keep up.
We should ask the 'Ethos'
headquarters to expand this
workshop.

I'm selling the parts
in the warehouse now,
but if this keeps up,
they're gonna run out.

We're out of Gear parts
in the warehouse.
I'm gonna have to order
more from the 'Ethos'
headquarters.

I have finished restocking
the parts, now maybe I can
get some rest at last.

I'm gonna have to
cooperate with the
surviving mechanics.

I'll have to ask the
'Ethos' headquarters
to send a mechanic that
can repair army Gears.

The competition is 
all gone. Sigh.

The rest of the country 
has an unusual interest 
in this area's ruins.
Large units have come to 
excavate all the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

   -This month's goal-   
 
    Search for parts!

   -This month's goal-
 
   Don't let the parts
 in the warehouse run out.
 
   Give repair priority

I've seen the end of the
war with Kislev and the
deposition of that Prime
Minister who grew fat off
of our country.
I'm old but very happy
that I can live out my
days peacefully with my
grandchildren.

The area around this town has
the highest concentration of
ruins on the southern part
of the continent of Ignas.
Aveh and Kislev have been 
fighting over these ruins
forever. I'm old now. I
just want to live in peace.

Oh dear, the water
has stopped again!
The workshop must be
using it right now.

Actually, ever since the
guild came the waterworks
here have gotten better,
but...nobody's perfect...

They always said that
when you get old, you'll
have trouble with your
waterworks...but I didn't
realize they meant this!

Lately Grandpa's been in a
'happi' and 'jelly' mood.

Lately Grandpa's been in
a 'blew' and 'gum' mood. 

He's also got 'dork' and 
'centanmental' moods too.

Now that we have peace 
the kids can play outside.
Isn't it great?

Lately the town has

It's nice to see the
children so happy.

Hey, has something good
happened? All the soldiers
have been smiling lately.
They've all become so nice!
It's great!

Hey, are all the soldiers
here to dig up the ruins?
I thought they were after
the bad 'Kiss-led' men...
Guess I was wrong.

Man
I wonder who built
all those ruins?
Some say an ancient
civilization which
ruled this land long
ago built them...
But after looking at
the results of the
geologic tests, I
have my doubts.

Lady
My hubby acts sooo smart
with his ruin theories.
Why don't we just leave
the ruins to the 'Ethos'!

"Let us go the that shop
we visited earlier and
rent the buggy."

Citan
"Fei, let us first find
the person who will
rent us this buggy."

Dazil - Rental Shop - 0678
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gear Pilot
Civilian worker Gears have
no chance against military
worker Gears in excavating.
But even if we had a
military Gear, we wouldn't
be able to operate it...

Shop Owner
Hm? Haven't met you before.
So you want to rent out a
sand buggy too?

Fei
"Sand buggy?"

Citan
"A sand buggy is a special
type of vehicle designed
for the desert terrain.
Its tires will not get
stuck in the sand...
You really need them for
long desert trips."

Shop Owner
Sorry but all our buggies
are lent out now. Do you
want to wait for one?
Some of those guys
hunting for parts should
be back soon.

Citan
"I see...
Well then, we will
come again later."

Shop Owner
Sorry, it's not back yet.
Please wait a little more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"You can't pilot
a military Gear?
Why is that, doc?"

Citan
"Military and civilian
Gears are different in
their basic structure.
That is why you need
special training and
natural talent to use
military Gears."

Fei
"What do you mean...'If you
aren't trained, you can't
pilot a military Gear.'?
(Wasn't that Gear we found
a military Gear?
So why could I get it to
work then, doc?)"

Citan
"In your case Fei, it
is because your natural
talent is so prevalent."

Dazil - Dig Site?? - 0680
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon this area will be
totally excavated...
We'll have to find 
another place with 
buried treasure...

Running into those army
guys is real dangerous...
If they find new ruins,
they'll take them over
for themselves...
So, I wonder where
the best place is?

Shh!
I'm trying to think.
So, keep it down.

Since the army no longer
controls the dig sites,
you can go by yourself...
Now the buying prices at
the 'Ethos' workshop
have gone down.
What should we do?

I came here looking for 
fortune...but all the
good sites are controlled
by the military.
I'll have to go home a
failure. What should I do?

I wanted to try my luck 
at treasure hunting.
I'm pretty successful.
The reason is I found a
good partner.
Even now he's looking at 
a map, analyzing our next
step. I sure depend on my
pal.

   - Come to Dazil! -
 
 If you dig in the ruins, 
   you too can be rich!

Dazil - Workshop? Lost wallet - 0692
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh no, my wallet...
Just when I get enough 
money to fix my Gear,
I lose my wallet.
What am I gonna do?

Bah! Those 'Ethos' fools!
Just because they can fix
Gears they think they can
act all high and mighty.
How do they expect us to
pay so much?

He's always drunk! The
good-for-nothing slob!

I told him not to drown in
his sorrows, but he wouldn't
listen, would he...

Sorry, my parts supplies
are low so I can't sell
anything to civilians.

 Welcome! 

I've got to improve the
performance of my Gear
with the parts I've 
bought here...even if 
its only a little bit.

I hear there are parts for
your Gear that increase its
performance and abilities
incredibly just by equipping
them on it...
I wonder if they have any
such parts here...?
...Somehow, I doubt it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dazil - Entering Ethos workshop - 0696
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Wow...
So this is the 'Ethos'
workshop, heh, doc?"

Citan
"Yes. The 'Ethos' workshops
are the only places that
officially repair Gears.
Let us see if we can get
the parts we need to fix
Weltall here.
As they say, time is money!
...So we should do whatever
we can do as soon as we are
able to."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gear Mechanic
Huh?
How can we help you?

Citan
"Sorry to bother you.
Our Gear has broken down,
so I would like to buy
some parts to fix it."

Gear Mechanic
Tough luck, huh?
Can you tell me what make
of parts you are after?

Citan
"Yes, we are hoping to
replace an X-29 model
injection bypass circuit."

Gear Mechanic
X-29 model injection
circuit?
That's only used on the
latest military models.
We don't keep those kind
of parts in stock here.
You can only get such
special parts by placing
an order at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
This workshop is only
for the repair of
civilian Gears...

Citan 
"I see.
Sorry to have
bothered you."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These days the 'Ethos'
technology has become
indispensable in people's
day-to-day lives.
We thought we'd use these 
left over facilites and 
try and help everyone as 
much as we can.

You two again?
As you can see, this facility
is for the repair of worker
Gears only.
We simply can't help you out
with the new model military
Gear that you have.

This town was orginally a
haven for treasure hunters
searching the ruins.
Our workshop can hardly keep
up with the demand for repairs
on the worker Gears used in
the excavation of the ruins.

Sorry that we
can't help you.

Please don't touch it.
It's being repaired.

Shop Owner
The sand buggy you were 
waiting for is back.
Do you want to rent it?

Citan
"Yes, that is right.
Do you have any we
can rent right now?"

Citan
"Well then, 
if I may."

Citan
"Fei, I am going into the
desert to search for parts
for Weltall."

Fei
"Going to the desert? Doc,
are you going to excavate
some ruins or something?"

Citan
"The Kislev and Aveh armies
are confronting each other 
in the desert all the time.
There is talk that their
forces often break into
battle over the ruins."

Fei
"What does that have
to do with that Gear?"

Citan
"If I search the battle-
fields for the wrecks of
such army Gear...
...I should be able to
find the parts we need.
(Besides Weltall is a
Kislev Gear, so we need
parts from Kislev Gears.)"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"Fei, you are such a
worrier. Things have
a way of working out.
You do not need to worry
so much. Why not go kill
some time at the bar
until I get back."

Fei
"Doc..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shop Owner
Hey, are you letting
him go out there alone?
Lots of fights break out
in the desert...it's a
real dangerous place.
I've heard about a group
of pirates riding around
attacking people on a
sand cruiser.
You really shouldn't let
him go out there by
himself.

It's best if you go out
there and try to find
him as soon as you can.

Of course...the keys are 
in the ignition, you can 
take it now.

Please bring the sand
buggy back as soon as
possible. Thank you!

So when will you be
returning the buggy?

I...you coward. It was you!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"You're the one from...
Lahan...!!"

Citan
"Here we go again..."

Man In Black
"My name is Grahf...
The seeker of power.
You certainly showed how
much power you had back
there in Lahan, didn't
you, Fei!?"

Fei
"How much power I had?
What are you talking
about!"

Grahf
"A greater power...
is what I need to
fulfill my mission.
I sent those Gears into
that land as a catalyst to 
awaken the power in you...
To make contact with you."

Fei
"As a catalyst!?
You mean you caused
that intentionally!?"

Grahf
"That's right.
The death of your loved
ones...
And you powerless against
it happening... The grief,
the screams from your heart
born out of the tragedy...
There!
That was the catalyst for
triggering your power."

Fei
"You mean you attacked my
village just to get me in
that Gear!?
Why!?
Why did the villagers
have to die...?"

Grahf
"Who cares why!
It does not matter how
many of them died...
They were wretched vermin,
only living from day to day
without ever fulfilling
their prescribed destinies!
And have you forgotten?
You were the one who
destroyed the village.
I did not lift a finger."

Fei
"No!!
I was just trying to save
the village and its people!
I never intended to destroy
it!!"

Grahf
"Is that really so?
Surely you have heard it?
It is the very essence of
you...the voice of desire
from within you that
craves destruction."

Fei
"Shut up!
Even if that were
true, aren't you
still the one who
caused it!?
If you hadn't come,
the village wouldn't
have suffered the
way it did!"

Grahf
"Ah, so now you resort
to blame? I see...
That sounds like something
'you' would say.
That's good. Your basic
nature remains unchanged."

Fei
"Crap..."

Fei
"You said you need my
power? What were you
intending to do with it!?"

Grahf
"You know very well...
It is to destroy...
mother god..."

Fei
"D, destroy god?"

Grahf
"Yes, we will destroy god.
That is our purpose...
That is our destiny!"

Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!
I won't get involved
in such a thing!
If you want to destroy
your god, or whatever
it is you're on about...
do it by yourself!!"

Grahf
"Hah, hah, hah...
You resemble your
father."

Fei
"My father?
You mean my dad?
You know my father!?"

Grahf
"That was...
a most delightful scream.
I was enthralled by it.
Nothing is more beautiful
than a scream of death."

Fei
"What did you do to my
father!? What happened
between you two!?"

Grahf
"Hmph, do you really wish
to know? There is no use
in you knowing it now."

Fei
"What!?"

Grahf
"Your power is still
beneath that needed
for my purposes.
Anything unusable
must be tried until
it becomes suitable."

Fei
"What?"

Fei
"!!
What in hell
is that!?"

Grahf
"What will you do, Fei?
If you die here, then
so be it.
You may indeed gain some
happiness from not knowing.
But surely, that is not
what you truly want...?
If you want to know the
truth...and that is what
you want, isn't it Fei...
then this is what to do...
You must show me that you
have attained the level of
strength I require...
To do that you must destroy
others by using your own
strength!
Then you will gain all
that was lost in exchange
for that scream of death!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"

Fei
"W, wait!
We're not finished
talking yet!!"

I was careless.
That Gear is a top

model from Kislev...
It was only natural
that Aveh would also
be madly searching
for it."

You do not look so well."

I suppose you could

too, but..."

"It's the other stuff he
said...
What happened at Lahan...
was all planned to get me
to ride in that Gear...
Or so he claimed.
That's got me worried..."

in that Gear...?"

Fei
"Doc, before the village
was destroyed, I lived
without doubting myself.
But it's different now.
I don't...know who I am.
I've never felt like this
before..."

as long as we are prisoners
...even if we wanted to."

Let us rest a little.
Maybe it will sort your
feelings out a little.

maids at my home in Lahan
told me...
One night a strange masked
man carried me to Lahan.
I was heavily wounded at
the time...
In my delirium I called out
for my father...
That's all they could tell
me about my background.
I don't remember anything
of my father or my past...
So I guess I'm not really
all that lonely or sad..."

until now?"

Desert Attack! - Bart spots Weltall thru parascope - 0732
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bingo!
Just as the report said
- an Aveh transport.
And look at what we
have on top...!

No mistaking it! 
That's a new Kislev model! 
It has to be the stolen
Gear everyone is after!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Attack! - Bart and his crew ready an attack - 1180

Bart
Whatever the case...
There's no way we are
going to let that
Shakhan guy have it...

Gunner!

Gunner
Turret A 'Anton' and Turret
B 'Belta' can initiate their
ectropometers twenty seconds
after opening their hatches.

Bart
Franz!

Franz
I don't hear anything other
than the flowing sound of
the sand... No suspicious
radar activity detected!

Marseilles!

Marseilles
Maitreya's units are on
standby at the catapults.
They'll all be able to
launch one minute
after we resurface!

Bart
Good!
Let's do it!

BattCon level 1!

Crew
Surface-combat, ready!

Torpedo room, ready!

Anti-Gear guns, ready!

Navigation and Engineering
are also ready!

Maison
Y, young master!
What is happening?
What was the alarm
all about...

Sigurd
Not again...?
Young master!
Hold on a second!

Bart
Battle stations, everyone!
Surface navigation, begin
operating the sand pump!
Prepare to fire starboard
cannons upon surfacing!

Sigurd
Young master!!

Maison
Y, young master!!

Trim to the right!
The wind is strong up
there and we may be
blown off balance!
...
Jerico!
Hand the helm over to me!

Gunner
Alternate firing between
A 'Anton' and B 'Belta'!
Calculating adjustments!

Bart
Awww yeah!
Switch modes over to
salvos after the
initial shots!
Let's slow'em down.
Get ready to give them
a spankin' they won't
forget!

Maison
Young master, please wait!
It may just be a
requisitioned ship,
not a warship...

Bart
Let me handle this!
Whether it's a warship or
not, it's carrying a new
Gear!

Gunner!
Let 'em have it!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Attack! - Fei and Citan trapped in sand cruiser - 0726
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Oh-oh!"

Citan
"Judging by the angle...it
seems as if a gun blast has
made a hole in the hull...
We will probably sink
within minutes."

Fei
"A few minutes...
Doc!!"

Citan
"It is locked...
Somebody free us!
Argghh!!"

Fei
"Let's get out
of here, doc!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"There is a switch for the
sand barrier door on the
right hand side wall there!
But be careful...
Once it is closed it cannot
be opened again."

Citan
"We are too late..."

It is no good!
We are done for!

Citan
"Fei! If you close the
barrier door now we will
be buried alive here!"

Citan
"Fei! Hurry up!"

Citan
"Oh no, too late..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan

"Doc!?
Where did you go, doc!?"

Citan
"Fei! Can you hear me? I
am moving the crane towards
Weltall's cockpit.
Hurry!
Go up the crane to
Weltall!
We are going under fast!"

Fei
"...I got you, doc!
But when you're done, you
hurry up there too, okay!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-AFTER- Trying to go back into the sand cruiser

Citan
"Fei!
There is no time 
to go back!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Damn!
Weltall's stuck
in the sand...

"Waawwwww!"

"Oh!"

"Ah!"

"Oh!"

"Whew..."

Citan
"Wooh..."

Citan
"Whoops..."

Fei
"Are you okay, doc?"

Citan
"Ha ha ha...
Well, Doctor Citan Uzuki!
Feels like you have sacked
your saccules, and tickled
your utricles enough for
one life time! Wow, dizzy!"

Fei
"Sorry about that, doc!
I didn't have time to
open up the cockpit...
Are you really okay, doc?"

Citan
"Fei, I was only joking.
Riding in the hand was
not so bad.
I can see what is so
good about this top
secret experimental
Kislev machine."

Fei
"Yeah, when I started it
up, it began doing all
kinds of stuff by itself...
The environmental response
system and weight-reduction
hovering kicked in straight
away...automatically!"

Citan
"Really...?
Amazing...!"

Pirate
Save yourselves but leave
your friends to sink in a
sea of sand... Don't you
believe in comradeship?

Desert Attack! - Brigandier Appears - 0730

It's not very manly of you
two to leave your platoon
to die while you run away
in a Gear, you know?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Attack! - Brigandier vs Weltall - file11
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Wait one moment!
We're not
Aveh soldiers!"

Pirate
"Hm. Can't you make
a better plea for
your life?
You come jumping out
of an Aveh ship and
claim that you are
not Aveh soldiers!
Stop trying
to fool me!"

Fei
"I tell you,
it's true!"

Pirate
"Tsk.
How pathetic are you?!
Even if you're the
pettiest of soldiers,
how's about showing 
a little spine...
...and put up a
decent fight!"

Fei
"Stop it! I'm telling
you I'm no soldier!  I
don't want to fight!"

Pirate
"How nauseating!
Why don't you stop
grumbling,
leave the Gear and
run away?"

Pirate
"For someone who doesn't
want to fight, you're
quite powerful...
I see,
an all-environment
model... so that's it,
huh?
Now I want it
even more!"

Fei
"!?"

Pirate
"Oh-no!
This is not good!!"

Pirate
"In the heat of battle,
I go get caught in
quicksand!
Darn.
Me of all people!"

Pirate
"Damn!
It's all your fault!
Boy are you going to
get it later.
So be darn ready!"

Fei
"Why!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalactite Cave - Fei and Bart fall underground - 0750
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pirate
"Hey, come down here now!
I'm not gonna kill you.
All I want is for you to
leave this Gear... Huh?"

Fei
What?

Pirate
"Hey!?
You're not an
Aveh soldier?"

Fei
"I told you that in my
intercom transmission
earlier.
You're the one who
refused to listen to
me, right?"

Pirate
"Hah, ha, ha. Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I remember you were
saying something like that.
I went off half-cocked and
thought you were the enemy.
Uhh, ahem...
My name is Bart.
I'm the pirate that works
this territory."

Fei
"My name is Fei.
I was arrested for no
apparent reason, shoved
into that Aveh transport
ship...
...And was nearly going to
be sent to a concentration
camp until you went and
blew the thing to blazes.
Anyway...
I'm just glad to have
been able to survive."

Bart
"I see...
Well, I'm glad I at least
helped you out a little.
But I didn't expect a
civilian like you would
be riding in a military
Gear.
Besides, this Gear is a
brand new model.
I've never seen this type
before."

Fei
"Let's just say that
a lot of things have
happened...
It wasn't like I
wanted to pilot it!"

Fei
"Where are we anyway?
Looks like we fell into
one weird place.
I've never heard of huge
stalactite caves such as
this existing under the
desert before."

Bart
"What? You don't know
anything, do you?
Where are you from?
The desert only covers
around 1000 sharls of the
outer layer of the earth.
The stratum underneath
that consists of igneous
rock."

Fei
"From a sea of trees to
a sea of sand...and now
a stalactite cave...
What's next...?"

Bart
"What are you
talking about?"

Fei
"Oh, nothing...
Never mind..."

Bart
"We're in trouble...
Look, the hole we fell
through has disappeared.
We'd better find some
other way out...
So, you wanna call a
truce for now?
...At least until we
find an exit and get
out of here."

Fei
"Yes...
agreed.
First, we gotta find
the way out of here...
So, let's get going..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalactite Cave - On top of Yggdrasil - 1168
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Soldier 1
Phew, thank god...
I didn't wanna dry up and
die up in the desert...

Mechanic
Hey, you!
I know you're tired but
don't go any further
than there!

Soldier 2
Shut up!
You sunk our ship!
Don't you forget that!

Man
No, you shut up!
Just be thankful that
you were saved!

Nurse
Excuse me...

Is there anyone who is
almost dead, with no arms
and legs, or in need of
an abdominal operation!?

No one...? 
Well that's
depressing...

Citan
"I see...
So your 'young one' has
not just been shooting
at anything and every-
thing then, Sigurd."

Sigurd
"Yes, he actually
calculated this attack...
...or so he says!
As you can see...
no one has died this
time, either."

Gear Pilot
Sigurd, sir!
The collection of the goods
and soldiers from the Aveh
transport is almost complete.
We still can't locate the
young master... General
Maitreya's platoon will
scout around again.

Sigurd
"Okay.
I'm counting on you."

Gear Pilot
Yes, sir!
Since I'm part of the unit
I'll also excuse myself.

Citan
"So, what happened to
this 'young one' you
call 'master'?"

Sigurd
"He fell into an under-
ground cave with that
other guy in a Gear.
It's near an old excavation
site, and he is riding in a
Gear, so he'll probably be
able to come up somehow...
We'll try to find him for a
while, and if that doesn't
work, then we'll wait for
him at our meeting point."

Citan
"You seem to trust
him a lot..."

Sigurd
"Trust him...
Yeah, I trust he'll
get us into trouble."

Sigurd
"But I never thought I
would meet you here,
'Hyu'..."

Citan
"It is not coincidence.
It is an inevitable
consequence...I assume."

Sigurd
"...Hyuga...
Are you saying something
is about to happen?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalactite Cave - Bolder blocks path - Great Hall - 0734
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
My sensors are responding
to something.
There appears to be quite
a large cavern on the
other side of here."

Bart
"If we can get rid of this
rock...but I don't think
it's possible."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Hey, this is huge.
What can we do with this?
I doubt you can break it."

Fei
"I guess we could
try pushing it..."

Bart
"Wait, no matter how
you look at it..."

Fei
"What the heck are you
doing? Hurry up and
help!!"

Fei
"We can get by if we help
each other.
Let's keep it up so we
can get out of here."

Bart
"The hydromechanic pipe for
my knee joint is on the
verge of breaking down.
It's all because of that
fall from the ceiling...
followed by pushing this
mega-colossal boulder.
It won't be funny if my
Gear malfunctions in a
huge cavern like this."

Fei
"Your friends won't
come and help us?"

Bart
"It'd be a waste of time
waiting. They probably
won't come."

Fei
"But, aren't they your
friends?"

Bart
"We believe in a
liberal upbringing.
They'll think we can
escape by ourselves."

Fei
"I wonder if doc
is okay."

Bart
"Don't worry about the
man you were with.
I'm sure our guys saved
him by now."

Fei
"..."

Bart
"What is it?"

Fei
"...
We wouldn't have fallen
in here if you had only
listened to me."

Bart
"Don't blame it on me!
You should've surrendered
instead of challenging me.
All I wanted was your
Gear."

Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!
You're the one who blindly
attacked me. What else was
I supposed to do?
I thought I might die if
I didn't fight you."

Bart
"I was taking it easy on
you. Couldn't you tell?
Then you're a bit dense."

Fei
"Don't lie to me.
I know you were serious."

Bart
"What! You want some!?
Let's have it out!
Right here!"

Fei
"..."

Bart
"Wait! Settling it
right here comes first.
I won't be able to get
anything done until we
settle this once and
for all!"

Fei
"I thought you wanted a
truce for now? Getting out
of here should come first!
Once we're out of here,
then I'll fight you all
you want. Let's hurry up
and move on out of here!"

Bart
"I don't like you
very much...
Damn it!
I'll get you when we
get outta here."

Stalactite Cave - Outside Old Man Bal's Cave - 0738
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Who'd have thought there
would be someone living
in a place like this!
Let's check it out!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalactite Cave - Old Man Balthazar's Cave - 0748
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Hey, Fei! This is a
surprise! There's someone
living in this place!"

Old Man
Hmm, it's been a while,
but I thought I could hear
the sound of Gears.
I assume they are yours?
Well anyway, come on back
in here and make yourself
at home.

Old Man
It's been a long time
since my last visitor.
What happened? Did you
fall from the surface?

Bart
"I guess that's it."

Old Man
I see...
That's too bad.
I can tell from the sound
that you both ride good
Gears...
But the legs seem to be
playing up a bit.

Fei
"You mean, you can tell
what's wrong just by the
sound of its footsteps?"

Old Man
Ha ha ha.
It's easy to know what's
wrong with Gears by the
sounds they make.
My guess is that one
of them needs a new
hydromechanic pipe
in its joints.
It's making a
nasty sound.
It must be hard to
walk with too.
Oh, by the way, the
name's Balthazar,
but you can call me
Ol' man Bal.

Bart
"Oh yeah? 
So looks like we've got a
real fanatic here, huh!"

Bart
"What's an old man like
you doing in a place 
like this?"

Ol' man Bal
"I guess you can call me a
'fossicker' or a 'collector
of things'.
There is much to be found
lying around in this here
stalactite cavern."

Bart
"A collector, huh?
Sounds interesting."

Bart
"The things on this shelf,
are they some of the stuff
you have found?"

Ol' man Bal
"You mean the fossils?
They're one of the 
things I collect.
Feel free to have a
look at them."

Ol' man Bal
"Around here you can dig up
ancient machines along with
human and animal fossils.
Notice anything particular
on these shelves? They go
from oldest on the left,
to newest on the right."

Bart
"Are you an archaeologist
or something, old man?
I don't quite see what
you're talking about.
They just look like a
bunch of old bones to me.
Fei, what do you think?"

Fei
"...Let me see.
First, there are no
human bones up to here.
Then, from here on over
to the right, something
is slightly different...
I guess."

Ol' man Bal
"Yes, from a certain point
in time, human fossils
suddenly no longer appear.
That point is roughly
10,000 years ago."

Bart
"What does that mean?"

Ol' man Bal
"Don't ask me.
I don't know for sure...
But my guess is, there
were no humans on this
planet before then.
At least it appears so."

Bart
"How could that be?
What about all that
talk about evolution?"

Ol' man Bal
"You mean the theory of
evolution as taught by
the 'Ethos', right?
You can't trust that!
Rather, I believe in the
old legends and myths."

Fei
"Legends?
Myths?"

Ol' man Bal
"Haven't you heard
of this story...?"

Ol' man Bal
"They say that humans and
god lived together in a
paradise in the sky.
With god's protection,
there was no fear of death
and natural disasters were
entirely unknown.
Then one day, the humans
ate a forbidden fruit
which gave them incredible
wisdom.
But god drove mankind from
the paradise for their sin.
Bitter at having been
driven out of paradise,
humans used the wisdom they
had gained to make giants.
With these giants, they
planned to challenge god
himself. But god poured
his wrath down on them.
All who defied god were
destroyed. 
But god himself did not
escape unharmed.
Taking paradise with him,
the wounded god buried
himself deep beneath the
ocean to sleep for eons.
Before going to sleep, god
used his remaining power to
create right-hearted humans
to live on this planet.
These people are said to
be...our ancestors."

Ol' man Bal
"Well, anyway, I'll
stop my rambling now."

Fei
"By the way, does 
this cave have..."

Ol' man Bal
"An exit?
There is an exit in the
excavation site beyond the
sand barrier. You can get
outside through there."

Bart
"Sand barrier? You mean
that huge wall you can
see from your entrance?"

Ol' man Bal
"Yes, that's it.
On the other side is an
old Aveh excavation site.
They built the wall when
Aveh was excavating here
to keep the sand from
falling in from above.
But they've stopped work
there now."

Fei
"So, how do we open such
a huge thing like that?"

Bart
"If it's a wall,
you can probably
break it down."

Ol' man Bal
"Hold your horses
there young'uns.
No matter how good a Gear
you have, you'll never
break that wall down.
It's much too strong.
So...
let's make a deal." 

Bart
"A deal?"

Ol' man Bal
"The wall was closed
due to the reaction of
the 'Sand Sensors'.
Thanks to that, now I
can't get through to
the other side either.
Maybe it happened when
you two fell in here.
Were you boys fighting
up there or something?"

Fei
"You seem to be able
to tell everything!
Anyway, so what can
we do about it?"

Ol' man Bal
"It's very simple.
You just have to turn off
the Sand Sensor switches.
Doing that will keep the
barrier from closing again.
While you two are doing
that, I'll open it up."

Fei
"Right, got it."

Ol' man Bal
"The sensors are in two
places. You should see
their flashing red lights.
Well, good luck then." 

Fei
"Let's go Bart."

Ol' man Bal
"Oh, before you go...
I can share some parts
and fuel with you.
Just talk to me whenever
you need something, right."

Bart
"Thanks, old man.
Well, we'll go and finish
our part of the deal then!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ol' man Bal
"Now hurry and shut off
the Sand Sensors.
Or do you have something
else you want to ask?"
    Where are the sensors?
    About Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, which do you want?"
    For Gear use
    For character use

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items

"It's been a while since
I last serviced a Gear.
This should be fun."

Ol' man Bal
"A Gear's strength changes
with the parts equipped and
how the pilot handles it.
First, let's talk about
the Engine.
With a good Engine your
Attack Power and fuel 
capacity go up.
HP depends on the Frame
and Defense Ability on
the Armor equipped.
Here's a tip for when your
fuel is low: use 'Charge'
to replenish it a little
as you defend yourself.
When you are fighting a
strong enemy, use 'Booster'
to increase your mobility
and power.
If you use Booster too
much though, your fuel
will run out.
So think carefully and
try to find your own
style of fighting."

Ol' man Bal
"First, changing the
engine is a good idea."

Ol' man Bal
"First, try changing
the engine."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"I don't know where they
are. Can you tell me?"

Ol' man Bal
"One is up on the rock
ledge above the boulder
in the 'Great Hall'.
You can find it by climbing
the 'Terrace Stones' out
there and heading into the
passage on northwest wall.
The other sensor is on
the road from which you
can see the waterfalls.
You can get to it by going
northwest from the place
where the Gear is standing.
It is on a rock ledge.
You can tell that it is a
Sand Sensor by its square
shape and the flashing red
light it emits."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
-AFTER- Shutting off the Great Hall Sand Sensor

Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut off
the 'Sand Sensor' on the
ledge in the Great Hall...
But there's another 'Sand
Sensor' on the road from
which you can see the
waterfalls.
It's on a rock ledge,
northwest of where my
repair robot stands.
Anything else you want?"
    Explain Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-AFTER- Shutting off the Waterfall Grotto Sand Sensor

Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut
off the Sand Sensor in
Waterfall Grotto.
But there's still one more,
above the big boulder in
the Great Hall. I think
you've seen it already.
Anything else?"
    Explain Gear functions

You can get to the bridge
from the northwest side

Fei
"Well done, old man!"

Ol' man Bal
"Our deal is done."

Bart
"Hey, old man.
There's one thing I
want to ask you."

Ol' man Bal
"What is it?"

Bart
"I've heard somewhere on
this planet is a Gear far
superior to all others.
I've heard that it was
called 'the god Gear' and
was made in ancient times
but hidden away somewhere.
Do you know anything
about it?"

Ol' man Bal
"A man-made god, created
with the wisdom of god!
Such a Gear would have the
power of a thousand Gears.
In a wave of its arm, it
could destroy whole cities.
Its battle cries would
thunder in the heavens.
You must be speaking of
the 'Omnigear'."

Bart
"You know of it?
Then perhaps it was what
you were speaking about in
that tale you told us of
the battle with god..."

Ol' man Bal
"Goodness gracious,
you too, boy?
Those stories were made
to inspire man's soul.
But they're just legends.
They don't really exist."

Ol' man Bal
"Anyway, allow me take
a look at your Gears.
It'll only take a
little while, so
wait here please."

Bart
"Hey, wait!
Arhh, he's gone..."

Fei
"Hey Bart. Do you think the
Gear in that story's buried
in the ground somewhere?"

Bart
"I think that's
what I've heard."

Fei
"Could one of the Gears we
are using possibly be it?"

Bart
"Yeah, right!
What are the chances
of that happening?

Fei
"?"

Bart
"The Gears that are
excavated lately...
...are usually only a
few hundred years old.
Nowhere nearly as old as
the Gear in that legend."

Fei
"Then why were they
in the ground...?"

Bart
"I don't know.
There are no records. 
Except..."

Fei
"Except what?"

Bart
"There must be some truth
in the tales that they were
buried after a great war...
The bullet wounds covering
most of the Gear's armor
would appear to confirm
that."

Fei
"You mean that there are
no records from the last
several hundred years?
How about before that?"

Bart
"None from either period.
The 'Ethos' controls
all the records from
that time period.
Maybe they have some very
ancient records too...
All we know about our
history is from the
little pieces that we
find for ourselves."

Bart
"Anyway Fei, what do you
make of the old man?"

Fei
"What do you mean...?"

Bart
"Why would such an old 
man live all alone in
this abandoned cave?"

Fei
"I don't know. Probably
digging for ancient
Gears or something?"

Bart
"Right!
So you think so too?"

Fei
"Hey!
I just said that as a joke.
Don't take all that stuff 
seriously. They're only
legends, you know."

Bart
"No...that old man 
is up to something!"

Ol' man Bal
"This can't be..."

Fei
"??"

Bart
"What's wrong, old man?"

Ol' man Bal
"Is this your Gear?"

Fei
"Well, 
sort of..."

Ol' man Bal
"Where did you get it?"

Fei
"I'm just borrowing it."

Ol' man Bal
This is...

the host for the spirit
of the slayer of god...

Fei
"Wait a moment! 
What did you just say?"

Ol' man Bal
"Nothing.
I didn't say anything!!"

Fei
"No! I heard you!
You said, slayer of god...
That's what you said,
isn't it old man!!"

Ol' man Bal
"Your Gears are fixed.
You have no more
business here.
This is a bad time for me.
Be on your way!"

Fei
"Be on our way...?
Listen here, old man...!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ol' man Bal
"I told you to leave!"
    Tell us some more
    Sell us Gear parts

Ol' man Bal
"I have nothing more to say
to you, so just leave."

Ol' man Bal
"When Calamity beats you,
I'll just get these parts
back anyway...
If you don't mind that then
I'll sell them to you...!"
    For Gear
    For characters

Trying to scare us with
all show and no power,
eh, Fei!"

Fei
"............"

Bart
"Anyway...looks like
that's the exit.
So, it'll soon be adios
to this old cavern!"

Fei
"!?"

you just do?"

was that?
... Don't you know?"

"That was incredible!
You just blew that huge
thing to pieces!
Why didn't you use
that technique a bit
earlier?"

Fei

technique... I have no
idea how I even did it!"

"Hmm. Oh well, I guess
that doesn't matter.
Anyway...
thanks for helping
me out!"

rid of that nuisance,

That's where Bledavik, the
Royal Capital of Aveh, and
Fatima Castle are located.
Currently, there's no king
living there though.
Anyway, that's my old home

Fei
"Home town..."

"I'd like to go ahead and

considering how close we
are to the capital of Aveh,
we'd probably get caught."

Bart
"Hey, stop looking so

I guess I'll have to get
you back to your friend
soon or you'll die from

Don't worry, you'll be

Citan
"Fei!
I was worried about you!"

Fei
"Doc..."

Maison
Welcome to the sand cruiser
"Yggdrasil". We apologize
for that earlier incident.

Maison
"I'm sure everyone has
already had the courtesy
to introduce themselves. 
But allow me to introduce
the sand pirates' leader,
Master Bartholomew."

Maison
"By the way, may I ask,
young master, did you
apologize to Master Fei?" 

Bart
"What?  Uhh...yeah...
I told him I was
'wrong'... Right?"

Fei
...

First Mate
Just telling someone you
were 'wrong' after the
event isn't going to solve
everything, young master.

First Mate
"I'm sorry I've delayed
introducing myself...
My name is "Sigurd", the
First Mate of this sand
cruiser.
Fei...that was your name,
right? Hyu... I mean,
Citan told me a little
about what happened.
We caused you so much
trouble because we acted
recklessly. I sincerely
apologize to you.
As recompense, allow us to
give you a ride to what-
ever destination you want.
But, please excuse us for
a while as we make a detour
to go back to our base for
supplies.
In the mean time, enjoy a
pleasant cruise...or should
I say, 'sand cruise'.
It must be fate that we
met like this..."

Maison
"Well then, please let me
know if you need anything."

Bart
"...That's the situation...
So now, forgive me, will
ya!?"

Sigurd
"Young master!
Stay out of mischief."

Bart
"Ouch ouch ouch!!
Don't pull my ears!"

Citan
"Let us go and wait in our
cabin until we arrive...
It is well-made and
comfortable."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"What is wrong?
You look down."

Fei
"No...
Well..."

Citan
"Something happened?"

Fei
"No, nothing."

This is Weltall.
Height 16.3 sharls
Base Weight 17.8 kahnns
Full Weight 22.7 kahnns
when fully equipped.
A well balanced Gear in
offensive, defensive,
and Ether abilities.
But it has some parts that
cannot be disassembled...
I guess you can call them
'blackboxes'...?
They don't cause problems
in maintenance, but they
just get on my mind every
time that I see them.

This is Brigandier,
our boss, the young
master's Gear.
Height 17.0 sharls
Base Weight 13.9 kahnns
Full Weight 18.6 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It is specially tuned for
desert battles. The power
of the Hover-thrusters in
the legs are especially
worthy of attention...
Oh, and the eyepatch and
feather decorations were
added later at the young
master's request.

We didn't know what to do
when young master said,
"Destroy one sensor and
put an eyepatch over it
...without weakening the
ability to reconnoiter..."!

That Gear with the
slender build withstood
Brigandier's rod?
What kind of armor did
they use to cover it?

Officer 1
Maitreya admired your
dive technique.
I hear your zoom
technique is flawless.
Do you think you
can train me on
my next watch?

Officer 1???
Now, I must ready the Gear
parts. Maitreya's strict
with this sort of thing.

Officer 2
Hey? Did you see this month's
edition of "Gear Fan Magazine"?
They say, 'Hovering' is all

Until a while back, it used
to be special equipment that
only the young master had
equipped on his Gear!

Sigurd tried to help the

ended up injuring one eye.

We are proud of the young

rushes into things.

take end up being off...

Do you want to see
the ship's chart?
    Yeah, show me!
    No thanks.
	
Crew 3
While under the sand, there
is nothing but static...
As a matter of fact, there
is nothing to do either...

Crew 4
It's a lot harder to
control the ship after the
young master steered it.
He is so reckless...

Crew 5
I had a competition going  
on with the young master
the other day to see who
could tip the boat further.
Old Maison literally was
white as a sheet, saying
all the teacups were
destroyed...

Franz
"Oh, sorry...
I didn't realize that you
were there! 
Wanna hear some hot sounds
that I have recorded?"
    Sure.
    No thanks.

Franz
"Wanna hear some more?"
    Yeah, this is cool!
    No, enough already!

Franz
"Ahh...
Well that's too bad."

Gunman
When it comes to cannons, 
you don't know where the
shells will fly to until
you've actually shot'em.
But, they're suitable
for the pirating trade
because they're cheap
yet intimidating...
On the other hand though,
torpedoes blow everything
to blazes and are down-
right expensive too...

Crew 6
This ship uses innumerable
effect wings to pulverize
sand and wade through it.
If our balance is lost, 
we roll over in the desert.
It's all up to our skill!

I have to repair some of
the pumps that died now.
Oh, I also have to re-cover
the effect wings...

Maison
"Thank you, Master Fei!!
And please take care of
my young master, Bart."

Maison
"Master Fei,
please relax."

Maison
"..."

What?
Don't get all excited.

Hey, newcomer! 
Where ya from? 
Lahan?  Don't know it.
Hey, I was a 
Kislev soldier.
I didn't like the way 
they did things in the army 
so they kicked me out. 
The young master's got 
lots of power and
ambition, just like me.

This guy was once an
Aveh soldier. 
You just can't predict
destiny, can ya?
We used to fight each
other but now we're pals
sharing a meal together.
How about that, eh...!?

Speaking of food, 
I'm hungry...

This's bad!

You from Aveh? 
Oh, you're not. 
Well I was an Aveh soldier.
Aveh's Prime Minister,
Shakhan, has so much
military clout that he can
send us students off to war.
I wasn't happy with Shakhan.
So I got out of the army
and became a pirate.

I wonder if Francois is
doing well at home...?

What? No! Yuck...
She's not my girlfriend.
She's my dog.

In that earlier 
commotion my model 
got broken...

Bart
"Are you still here?
Get going!"

Ooh, if this shaking
keeps up, our precious
model will...!!

This model is really
nice. Just look at
the detail work...

Hey Fei!! Don't you
think this is great?
    It's pretty cool!
    No big deal

It is pretty cool, isn't it? 
There's a story behind this
model.
Let me tell you about it...
Twelve years ago, Sigurd took
Bart out of Aveh. They stole
Aveh's most powerful warship
and totally remodeled it.
They renamed it the
'Yggdrasil'.
This is the Yggdrasil
before the improvements.
I have it here to remind 
me of the hopes I had then.

(Heh heh...it was worth
the work that the first
mate and I put in on it.)

Hmph, a minute ago you
said it wasn't so great...

No big deal?
Well, let me tell you the
story behind it, cause might
just change your mind...
Twelve years ago, Sigurd took
Bart out of Aveh. They stole
Aveh's most powerful warship
and totally remodeled it.
They renamed it the
'Yggdrasil'.
This is the Yggdrasil before
the improvements.
I have it here to remind 
me of the hopes I had then.
But it's not important now,
I guess...

(Sigh...The first mate and
I worked so hard on this!)

Is that how you really 
feel? You're a liar Fei.

I want to make another 
Yggdrasil model...

Hey! Fei, 
you did a great job! 
We're counting on you!

Oh no!
All the Gears are supposed
to be under repair!!

Do you know why such a
small child is here?
She is a war orphan...
She was found crying in
the desert. They brought
her here in the Yggdrasil.
We must stop the fighting
from making any more
orphans like her.

Margie, you came back! 
I'm so happy! 
I'll come by and see
you later!

I hear you all did a good
job in protecting us...
I'm sorry I can't give you
a break, but I just can't.

Come back when you
rescue little Margie!
Good luck, Bart dear!

Bart
"Got it!
Hold down the fort
for us know!"

The enemy's coming? 
This place is impregnable, 
you don't have to worry!!

It's best if you 
take refuge now.

You look tired.
Maybe shopping will
perk you up.
(Even though they're
Bart's friends I have
to charge them!)

If you want anything 
just let me know.

What do you want?
    Items
    Accessories
    Gear parts
    Leave

Bart dear!
I was wondering when 
you'd show up!

Are you doing well,
Bart dear?

Oh! Fei dear!
I believed in you.
You said you'd help Bart.
And thanks from me too.

Bart dear, you don't find
many friends like this!
So you'd better be nice
to him, now!

Bart
"Yeah. The next time I
come back here, it'll
be with Margie...
So I'll be expecting
you to make something
good."

Alright dear, you just
leave it to Granny!

Fei dear!!
Did you see a little boy
and girl? I wonder where
they went?

Well now aren't you Fei? 
Bart dear said he made a 
'big strong friend'.

...

Be friends with Bart.
He's such a sweet child.
    Ahh, sure
    Not interested

Fei
"I know."

I'm counting on
you, Fei dear.

Fei
"It has nothing to
do with me..."

Well, I see you're
just like Bart, you
stand your own ground. 
You'll do fine.

If you're with Bart 
you'll do fine.

Fei dear,
...thanks.

Whoa!!

Granny!
I'm scared!

Hey, Granny.

Oops...
I'm so embarrassed.
But this is how I
am with children...

It's been a long time 
since we last had fun.
Let's play in the sand!

Dad, this is
the desert!!

Wahahaha!
You got a lot funnier
since I saw you last!!

Well, see ya!!

Presents, presents!
Wee! Weeee!

Me, I'm waiting for
my dad to get back.
But I'm not gonna cry!
Pretty good, huh?

Fei
"That's really good..."

Daddy!!

Welcome home, Daddy!!

There, there. Have you
been a good girl by
obeying the nice lady?

Yes!!

I was good, so...
where are my presents?

Presents!? Look, here's
a pirate dress up kit!!

Wow!
Thanks dad!!

Maison
"This is the dining hall.
I'm sorry it is so gauche."

Maison
"Please take a seat."

Maison
"Perhaps you would like 
some of my famous tea? 
Master Fei? Good Doctor?"

Maison
"Young visitors are rare
indeed, the young master
must be very happy.
If things were normal we
wouldn't be living in the
desert, but rather back
in the royal palace..."

Citan
"Royal palace...? You mean
that young one is connected
to the old Fatima dynasty?"

Maison
"Pardon?"

Maison
"N, no...
I'm just a senile old fool
who talks too much...
Pay no attention to what
I just said...
Hahaha..."

Citan
"But...that one-eyed
youth does have a
certain bearing."

Maison
"Oh...oh...oh...!
Well spoken Sir! Awfully
good of you to notice!"

Maison
"If I may...
I would like to tell you.
The young gent is the last
forgotten reminder of the
once proud Fatima dynasty.
...That is, before it was
destroyed by Shakhan's
minions...

Prince 
Bartholomew 
Fatima.

Citan
"Bartholomew?
Edbart IV's successor...
I am sure they announced
Bartholomew died of an
illness 12 years ago..."

Maison
"Officially, yes.
However in reality, we
rescued the young prince
from Shakhan's evil grasp."

Citan
"Then why must the prince,
the rightful heir, resort
to piracy...?"

Maison
"..."

Maison
"Since fleeing here, we
have had only one wish...
...that the young master
would grow up to be a
great man..."

Citan
"Not to...
reclaim the throne?"

Maison
"That is correct.
Of course, to say we have
absolutely no desire to
restore his rule...
would be a lie.
We have plans for that
as well."

Citan
"And part of those plans
would include piracy...?"

Maison
"Well, yes... 
But there is a reason
for that..."

Maison
"Regardless of who gains
the ruins' technology,
one thing is certain...
Both Kislev and Aveh will
simply use that power to
oppress the other.
I agreed with the young
master's idea of creating
a new power to balance
things out a little."

Citan
"I see...
It is far more effective
to plunder from the
shadows, than to excavate
the technology oneself."

Maison
"Of course pillaging is
an unpardonable act.
However...
for Aveh,
for Ignas, 
to continue like this..."

"I'm sorry if it sounds
rather self-righteous."

Citan
"That is something which
outsiders like ourselves
cannot comment upon.
From what you have told
me, I feel that the result
of what you are doing will
be good.
Seeing your children here
tells me that."

Maison
"I am much relieved 
by your words."

Maison
"Another cup of tea?"

Citan
"Yes please.
Thank you."

Citan
"You mentioned you had
plans. Why have you not
put them into action?"

Maison
"With Miss Margie
imprisoned, we dare
not do anything."

Citan
"She would not
happen to be
Nisan's...?"

Maison
"You are well informed,
my dear doctor.
She is the Great Mother
Marguerite of Nisan...
and the young master's
cousin, as well."

Citan
"Why would Shakhan
take her captive?"

Maison
"For the 'Fatima Jasper'!"

Citan
"The Fatima Jasper that
is said to show where
great treasure is?"

Maison
"My, good Doctor!
You do know an awful lot.
I am most impressed."

Fei
"No...
I'm just not
thirsty now!"

Maison
"Well, we have no idea
what the great treasure
actually is...
But it is said to be
strong enough to save
our kingdom if it is
ever in plight!"

Citan
"And Marguerite has
the Jasper that tells
the location?"

Maison
"Only half of it,
to be precise.
The young master
and Miss Marguerite
each have half.
Only by combining
the two halves will
anyone know where
the treasure is."

Citan
"What exactly is
the Fatima Jasper?
When you say a half
of the Jasper, I
imagine some kind
of necklace..."

Maison
"Only the heirs to Aveh
and Nisan know what it
really looks like."

Citan
"I see.
So that is why they
have her locked up.
My guess is that when
they do find out, her
chances of living are
not..."

Citan
"Ah, I apologize. 
I simply,
I mean...
I was only supposing
the worst case. 
So please do not take
it to heart..."

Maison
"No, that is a terribly
realistic scenario."

Citan
"..."

Citan
"Ahem.
What exactly do you mean
by great treasure...?"

Maison
"Well,
I haven't the foggiest..."

The Gear...!
He means the Gear!
It has to be it!

Maison
"Young master...
are the Gears alright?"

Bart
"Yeah...
Even though they were
sealed, sand's gotten
into the joints.
It's a pain in the neck
to fix, so I'm having
the crew take care of
it now.
My job is just to pilot
them anyway.
Besides, I'm bad with 
machines, so I'd just
get in the way."

Young master...

Bart
"Anyway...
What were we
talking about?"

Citan
"Whether the great
treasure could be
a...Gear?"

Bart
"Oh, yeah.
You know, something like
that is drawn in one of
the Aveh picture scrolls."

Citan
"Picture scrolls?"

...

Bart
"Well, if you're interested
then let's go to the
planning room...
I'll show you what I
mean...since you're my
special guests."

Citan
"That sounds
interesting."

!

Maison
"You do not like my tea,
Master Fei?"

...

We couldn't get as many
Gear parts as we would
have liked...but, by
all means, use them! 

This door leads to the hall.

Be sure to tune-up
your Gears for the
decisive battle!

Oh, young master!
You're smart not to get
lost inside the Yggdrasil!
All of our guests usually
get lost around here...

We're gonna help

Yeah!!!

Let's go!

Go down to the docks?
    Go down
    Not now

Fei
"I'm...so 
very...tired..."

They must've followed
us from the Cavern!
We screwed up!

That look... 
You must think we're a 
bunch of murderers? 
Well, we ain't...
We don't murder.
Hell, we even save the
lives of our enemies. 
This is Bart's police.

(I mean, 'Policy'??)

Damn it!! Gebler!!

We'll leave first thing
tomorrow. Are you ready?
    Wait
    Alright

Let me know when 
you're ready.

Did you forget anything?
    Wait a sec
    I'm okay

Let me know when 
you're ready.

Okay. Sleep well.

You wanna rest in a 
place like this?
You've gotta be
kidding...
    Let me rest
    Maybe later

Hey! I know it's a 
dump, but tough it out.

Whenever you wanna rest 
just lemme know.

That's what I thought.

Huh? 
I thought it was our
snoring.

...sniff, sniff...
Poor Helen...

!!

I'm reading, beat it!

This is no time 
for sleeping!!

You gotta rest when you
can so you can act when
you gotta.
Knowing when to do what
is important.

Which bed's better...?

Oh my god! 
We've been found!

We were just one step
from peace between Aveh
and Kislev.
Then, it is said, Bart's
father, Edbart IV, was
assassinated by Shakhan.

You won't get away 
with this Shakhan!!

He makes my blood boil!

Almost all the Gear 
are under repair!!

...Sigh... This injury
is so pathetic...
I can't let the Master 
see me like this.

Owwww!!
Please be more careful.

Good medicine always
tastes bad. 
Everyone knows that. 
Next is your shot!

Yipes, you're glaring!

Huh, what?

When you are sick, just 
tell me. I'll give you a
big shot and fix you up
right away.

This is no time 
for games!

Hey, do you have 
Margarita's card?

Nope, I don't. 
But I have Beth's.

Has the base been found?

I can't seem to get any.
(I mean cards, you fool!)

What is it, what?

A little rest...

What was that crash?

Gears have entered the
Yggdrasil's dock!

"Boy! What's up
with this Fei guy?
I try and become
his friend and he
suddenly explodes
in anger..."

Bart
"Well, looks like he's
got a lot on his mind.
I don't want to force him.
But he would be fun to
fight... 
Maybe I'll ask again."

If I lie in wait
under the elevator...

Bart
"What!?
Get out!!"

Fei
"..."

Bart
"Arrgghh, 
what a pain!"

Fei
"This is...
Bart's eyepatch!?"

Fei
"The pictures look like
Bart when he was a boy...
The girl next to him...
she must be Margie!!"

Fei
"Both of the pictures
look like Bart when he
was a kid...
The girl next to him...
It must be the girl that
they were talking about!"

Fei

A little boy and girl..."

"Are you ready? 
I am going later so get 
some rest before then."

Citan
"Fei, there is no need to
be mad at Bart. 
Just forgive him."

Citan
"Fei, there is no reason 
to be mad at Bart. 
Just forgive him."

Sigurd
"We set out early tomorrow.
It's best to get ready
today and rest up in our
rooms from the journey."

Sigurd
"I'm searching the 
information network
for reports on
Aveh's condition."

Sigurd
"What do you want to know?
    Who is Margie?
    Who is Shakhan?
    What's a Fatima Jasper?
    More about Nisan
    Nothing

Sigurd
"Margie is Mother 
Marguerite of Nisan.
But Shakhan of Aveh has
locked her up and is
looking for the Fatima
Jasper now.
Bart may not look it,
but he's very worried."

Sigurd
"Shakhan was the Prime
Minister of Aveh.
But he is the defacto
leader now.
His rule is what has
put our Aveh in turmoil."

Sigurd
"Margie has half of the 
Fatima Jasper.
Shakhan wants it because
it tells the location of
the great treasure."

Sigurd
"Nisan is a small,
sacred country in the
west of Ignas.
In its center is a huge
cathedral beautifully
ornamented.
The country was founded
by Sophia.
She is called the
'Mother of Knowledge'
by her followers, the
-Kahal-.
She was also Nisan's 
first Mother."

Sending the latest 
information!

We are praying for a
successful rescue!

Escape route 4 is for
civilians, all civilians
in the dock area take
refuge in the Yggdrasil!

12 years ago Sigurd 
fled Aveh with the young
master.
We've been good friends
ever since.

Sending the latest 
information!

We'll forward the latest
info. on to the Yggdrasil.
Good luck rescuing Margie!

They've entered gate 4.

We have an unidentifed
heat reading in the 
ventilation shaft.
They're Gears! Gate 3 
has been destroyed!

Main power source cut!! 
Switch to backup!

I wonder if Margie's
alright? I Hope she's not
hurt? We're only operators
but we still worry.
We can't do anything.
...Sniff...

Sending the latest 
information!

Good luck rescuing 
Margie!

Gears have been lost!

Citan
"This place is incredible!
They probably do not even
have equipment like this
in the capital."

Bart
"Heh heh. Surprised? 
All this technology
is thanks to Sig."

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
Don't stand on the screen.
We won't be able to see!"

Bart
"Alright men!
Display my special file
on the main screen."

Citan
"What is this...?"

Bart
"A picture scroll, nearly
500 years old.
This is King Fatima I...
'body cloaked in flames
making a blood oath with
giants'.
They say he used the
strength of the giants
to found Aveh."

Citan
"It is amazing that such an
ancient scroll exists...
and in such good state too!
I thought the 'Ethos'
controlled all such things
as these..."

Bart
"Normally, yes.
But this was one of
my father's prized
possessions."

Bart
"Next!"

Bart
"After founding the
country, Fatima forced the
giants into slumber...
...to protect his kingdom's
people if needed in the
future. But we don't know
where they are hidden.
In another record, one of
the giants is called the
'Great Fatima Treasure'."

Citan
"What about
the 'Jasper'?"

Bart
"Hey...
you sure know a lot.
Perhaps you're one
of Shakhan's spies?"

Citan
"Of course not.
It is only an intellectual
interest..."

Bart
"Just kidding. It appears
the Jasper is the key to
finding our treasure."

Citan
"A key...
Could that be what
Shakhan is looking 
for?"

Bart
"Not just him.
Gebler is also
looking for it."

Citan
"Really?
Then we must rescue
Marguerite as soon
as possible."

Bart
"You're telling me!"

Bart
"Since we helped you...I
was wondering if I could,
in turn, ask you a favor?"

Citan
"Would that be...
for us to help you
rescue her...?"

Bart
"Bright boy!
That's exactly it.
I heard from Sigurd...
it seems that both Aveh
and Kislev are after you!
So we can help you and
you can help us...
How about it? 
It's not much to ask."

Citan
"Well, if it pays for my
room and board then I will
help in any way I can..."

Citan
"What do you think, Fei?
You have not said
anything for a while..."

Bart
"Yeah.
You were great back there
in that stalactite cavern.
Your strength alone is
greater than ten or twenty
of Shakhan's guards."

...

Bart
"I'd love to have
your power on my
side!"

Fei
"Why does everyone want
to make me fight?"

Bart
"H, huh...
What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?"

Fei?

Fei 
"I just don't feel like it!
'Love to have my power'?
I don't have any!
What's wrong with you,
doc, everyone...
You're driving me to the
brink.
Then there's that Gear...
Grahf and my father...
I don't have the time to
help you out with your
problems when I've got
enough of my own!!"

Bart
"What's with him?
Is he always that
short-tempered?"

Citan
"No, that is not it...
I am sorry.
Things have happened so
fast that he has not had
time to deal with it all
yet. Try to understand."

Bart
"Are you ready?"
    I guess so
    Later

Bart
"Well, come back 
later then."

Bart
"Can I have a second?"
    Sure
    Maybe later

Bart
"Well, come back 
later then."

Sigurd
"Fei, get out of here, 
it's dangerous!!"

Fei! 
I'm still working on it
because of those guys.
It'll be a little longer
before Yggdrasil can leave.

Oh, Fei! 
You can take this elevator
down to the Gear Hangar.
Why don't you check on
Weltall and do
whatever maintenance
you feel like doing?

Alright, alright!!
Off your butts and
back to work!

Bart, good to see 
you back!

'Full rudder!!!'

Yessir!!

Did you hear anything about it?
    Yep
    No, about what?

Oh no. 
Don't tell anyone.

Oh really? 
That's nice. 
(Whew, I'm safe)

I did it! 
They made me the pilot 
apprentice!

I'd like to try and 
drive this thing once.

Welcome back! 
Bart!

Bart! 
What did you bring us?

Bart
"Well...I've got a new
model Gear and two people
that we helped out."

Ehh!
A Gear...how boring! 
Don't you have anything 
more interesting?

Bart
"I thought you'd
say that..."

Bart
"Look! This is amber I
found in a stalactite
cavern under the desert.
It's rare to find one 
with a bug in it!"

Wow!
Thanks Bart!

We got some amber!

What's that?

Let's go!
We gotta show it
off to everyone!

Bart
"Well then...
I'm gonna tune up
my Gear a little...
Why don't you two go
have some tea with
Old Maison."

Bart
"Thanks Old Maison."

Maison
"Please, walk this way."

Bart
"Citan told me all about 
your story. Do you want 
to talk about it?
Why didn't you tell me?
It sounds pretty rough."

Bart
"Listen...
I'm sorry for being
a jerk...just now..."

Bart
"Forgive me, will ya?"

...

Whoa!!

Bart
"Anyway...
Sorry to bring it
up again, but..."

Fei
"No!"

What?

Fei
"I don't like fighting 
like you do.
I only got into that
Gear because I had to.
I'd rather not ride them.
If you want that Gear so
much then you can have it!
I don't want it!"

Bart
"You think I
like fighting?
...Is that it?"

Fei
"Don't you? 
Sure looks that way.
It looks like the only
thing you do enjoy is
fighting."

Bart
"I can't let that slide.
Who likes fighting? 
Take it back.
Like it or not, I fight
because I have to.
I got my reasons, but
you wouldn't understand."

Fei
"Well I don't have a
reason to fight!
I don't want to fight.
I just want to live 
in peace and quiet.

But you people keep on
hounding me to get into
a Gear? Why don't you
just leave me alone!?"

Bart
"It's because I
see your skill
and think..."

Fei
"Well I hate it!
Whenever I get in a Gear
people get hurt.
If I fight, people die.
I don't want to hurt people!
I don't want anyone to die!
I hate it...
can't you see that?"

Bart
"Yeah, I know the
feeling of just wanting
to run away from reality.
But do you think the kids
left behind in your
village would understand?"

...

Bart
"Citan told me what 
happened in Lahan.
Would it have been better
if you had done nothing? 
Sure, that happened because
you were in the Gear.
But even if you hadn't,
people would have died...
Right?
You weren't the reason.
War...no, the people
who started the war are
the reason.
And unless you get rid of
the reason, nothing will
change. I fight to get
rid of the reason...
Right now there is no
other way so I have to
fight... But that doesn't
mean I enjoy it."

Bart
"I understand why you
would feel guilt toward
the kids in your village.
And I know why you don't
want to harm others.
But if you want to make 
it up to those children,
don't you have to fight?"

Bart
"You do have a reason to
fight. A reason you must
fight.
But as long as you ignore
it and continue to run
away, those kids will
never forgive you.
Just remember that."

Bart
"And another thing,
I'm not saying that not
helping me is running
away.
You don't have to help.
This is my own problem.
I don't wanna get you in
this against your will.
But, if I had your skill
I could bring all of
this to an end...
And make it up to those
kids. At least that's
what I think..."

Anyway...
sorry to hold you up.
The mechanic wanted to
talk to you about your
Gear.
You probably don't care
now, but at least hear
what he has to say.

Fei
"..."

Sigurd
"Look over there..."

Hey, dad...
Can you hear me? 
Ever since I first looked
in Fei's eyes I knew...
He's the same as me.
He'd understand me...
Or so I thought...
Did I just imagine it?

I have no confidence. 
If I follow after you,
dad...It'll just be like
I'm some decoration.
At the moment, I can't
even carry out your will,
let alone rescue Margie...

I told him he was only
running away but I'm
really the one who
wants to run away...

Sigurd
"The young master asked
me to apologize to you. 
Pretty strange, huh?
He knows it's best to
apologize in person...
But the young master
isn't all that good at
this sort of thing..."

Sigurd
"He may not look it,
but he's really quite
lonely...
He's always searching
for a friend.
We, his minders, can't
become his friends.
Even if we wanted to,
he just wouldn't see
us that way.
He knows that."

Sigurd
"Why you ask?
It's because of the
burden that he bears.
It must be difficult
for one so young to
carry so heavy a
responsibility.
But he does try to do
his best, you know?
That is why we stick
by him... It has
nothing to do with
him being the prince."

Sigurd
"Fei, I sense you too
are carrying a heavy
burden.
This might be a selfish
request, but...would it
be possible for you to
help the young master?
I'm not asking you to
burden yourself with
his problems or
responsiblities.
But could you two...
with whatever it is only
you two each know, help
the other? Please..."

Fei
"I'm sorry...
I need time to think."

Sigurd
"Of course...take your
time. It is completely
up to you.
Whatever you decide, we
will be leaving early
tomorrow morning.
After you're finished
preparing for tomorrow,
you probably should get
some rest.
You can use the bedroom
in the residential area
above."

Citan
"I wish to speak to Sigurd
some more...so you go
ahead and get some rest."

...

All noncombatants, 
go to the Yggdrasil!! 
Immediately!

Wahhh, 
I'm scared!!

Fei!!

Citan
"Fei!! Quick!
Get to Weltall now!!"

Fei!?

Citan
"Bart and the others are
already fighting!
Aren't you going to do
anything? 
Do you still think it has
nothing to do with you?"

...

Fei
"I..."

Fei
"I...
What
am I?"

Fei
"That old man...
he called me...
the slayer of god..."

Fei
"I don't want that
kind of power..."

My... 
strength...

My...
home...

Maison
"We must infiltrate Aveh 
and rescue Margie now!
Gebler has discovered this
base. So we should leave a
small garrison and evacuate
while we still can.
Fortunately, the Yggdrasil
is undamaged, so we are
able to embark immediately.
The crew's preparations are
complete.
Whenever you are ready,
Master Fei and good Doctor,
please accompany the young
master to the bridge."

Maison
"Doctor Uzuki, Master Fei, 
I thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
I would truly appreciate it
if you would be so kind as
to stay with us and help us
out on our rescue mission!"

Bart
"Hey, alright, alright.
Let me say goodbye to
the women before we go."

"OK over here!"

Broyer
"Confirmed!
It's their
base, alright."

Helmholz
"That rock was easy

I thought it would be
a little harder..."

Stratski
"These surface-dwelling
-Lambs- sure live in a
nice place..."

Renk
"Look at that...!
They built this place 
far better than the 
facilities at Bledavik.
It's probably a hidden
fort built when their old
king was still around..."

"Who cares...?
Let's just get this
over and done with!"

Stratski
"So...
where are the Gears?"

Stratski
"Over here?"

Helmholz
"To the right!
There's a hangar!"

Stratski
"!!"

Vance
"Found them!!"

Helmholz
"These are 'Deurmods'.
They're standard
pirate Gears."

Vance
"Ha!
Ignore those! We can
take them out fast."

Stratski
"Why not take a few?
Even if we only get those,
it was worth sneaking in."

Renk
"Alright!
Schpariel is now in
place at the back!
Get ready to take
out anything that
gets in our way!"

"Anytime is fine!"

"GO!!"

Yggdrasil - Maison telling story of their History to Citan - 0768
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maison
"Both Aveh and Kislev are
devoted to excavating the
ruins.
Each country's strength
is increasing daily.
Even if we could get the
help of all our comrades
to start a revolution...
...the combined strength
of all of us would still
not be enough.
We would certainly be
suppressed by Shakhan's
guards in no time at all."

We needed power.
We tried excavating the
ruins using the Yggdrasil
but it didn't work as
well as we expected.

Excavating requires
tremendous amounts of
time, labor and capital.
The best we can do with
our sand cruiser is find
small items in the sand.

Now what kind of sound will
you make when I do this?"

Wha!?

Fei
"Why are you fighting?"

Vance
"You, 
what are you doing!?"

Fei

get you?"

"I knew you'd
come round!!"

Fei
"We'll talk later!
We've got big trouble
coming down on us now!"

Citan
"I know I am a little
rusty...
There is a limit to what
I can learn seeing as I
started so late in life.
Even so, I hit that guy
hard and he did not go
down. They must be using
'that stuff'."

Citan
"Young one!
They are using -Drive-!
They are battle
enhancement drugs.
Normal attacks will
not hurt them!"

Bart
"Are you serious?
So that's how they
keep at it, huh?
Crap...
This'll never end!

Citan
"Fei!!"

Bart
"It's okay!
We'll get by
without him!"

Pirate's Lair - Bridge to Dock - 0774
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ah, Bartholomew. 
"The Gear are all aboard 
the Yggdrasil."

Good work. 
Without your backup, this 
base wouldn't be here. 
Let's board the Yggdrasil.

Thank you sir!!

This Gear is called
Heimdal. It was
excavated together
with Brigandier.
But we could never get it
to run very well. Three
test pilots were injured
in trying.
I guess no one can
tame it.

Brigandier is a star
of hope for us pirates.
The bright red body-color
represents Bart's ambition.
But since Bart always overdoes
things, maintenance is a pain.

This is a mass produced model
based on Bart's Brigandier,
that's simplified to reduce costs.
If you tune them up they're
pretty good. That's when we 
can really show our skills.

No, the specs on this
Gear are unknown...
And this kind of stuff
isn't anything I can
understand.

Looks like someone really
knew how to tune up your
Gear...
Attack, defense, 
Ether amplification... 
an exceptionally balanced
machine.
But we don't seem to be
able to dismantle some
parts to see what they
do...
I guess you could call
them...black boxes.
There are quite a number
of them on this machine...
Do you have any idea what
they actually do?

Fei
"No..."

This is your Gear,
right? This one's
worth tinkering with!
It makes use of some
incredible technology.
I'm gonna look over it
a bit, so can you come
back later?

Finally all the Gears
are on board the
Yggdrasil.
Yours is on board too.

Boss, let us mess with 
the Gears a little...
Craftsmen have to keep
practicing their skills!

I'm going to the
next hangar.

Thanks, Fei!!

Wow!
Cleaning is fun!

Thanks!!

When I grow up,
I wanna be a pilot...

Bart
"How many Gears
are there!?!
I think I took out
most of the small fry,
but...!"

Bart
"Dammit!!"

Bart's Officer
"There are at least
four, maybe five of
them left!
Their performance and
technique is far greater
than any of the ones
we faced before!"

Bart's Officer
"Young master!!
They're approaching!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Maison, does
this Gear work?"

Maison
"Pardon? Yes,
it works but..."

Alright!

Maison
"Out of the question! 
It is still under
maintenance.
It is nowhere near 
operational..."

Sigurd
"It's alright, Maison."

Maison
"Master Sigurd!
But, for a gent like
the good doctor...?"

Sigurd
"It's fine.
He'll be okay.
It may not even be
enough for him."

Master Sigurd...?

Citan
"Well...
It has been 5 years
since I last fought...
I hope I can still
remember..."

Citan
"Oh, a wild stallion,
eh?
Well then, it is high
time someone broke
you in..."

Citan
"Reinforcements!?"

Citan
"Compared to the pain
my friends are going
through,
Yours is
nothing...!!
I cannot allow people
like you to persist in
tormenting those who
cannot fight back.
I will take you on in
their place.
Come on!"

Broyer
"Eeeaaarrrgh!!"

Broyer
"H, hey,
that hurts!!"

Broyer
"??
What are you
talking about!?"

Fei
"..."

Fei! 

Fei
"Sigurd, doc...
What's up...?"

Sigurd
"We would like
to have a word
with you..."

Fei
"Oh, okay!"

Bart
"...
Th, th, thank...

Bart
"Thanks...
Fei."

Fei
"Bart..."

Sigrud
"Thank you, Fei.
Don't know how we could 
have done it without you."

Fei
"I...still
don't know what
I should do."

Sigurd
"Fei..."

Fei
"What Bart's doing
isn't for his own
gain.
He walks the path
he believes in, one
step at a time...
...wishing only for
the happiness of
those around him. I,
on the other hand..."

Sigurd
"..."

Fei
"I thought I didn't have
a path that I could take
laid out before me.
But like he said, that's
just running away. 
I must find my own path.
Right, doc?"

Fei
"If Bart wishes, I'll 
cooperate with you guys.
That's all I can do now.
But I think I'll find
the path I should follow
as I help others like you.
Moreover, I can't turn my
back and ignore what such
a terrible group of people
are doing to others."

Sigurd
"Thanks Fei."

Bledavik? - Bart talks to townspeople - 0776
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Hello, grandma."

Bartholomew, I heard from
my husband. Things were
pretty tough for you!
Oh...
just thinking about...
Shakhan gets my goat!
You get him Bartholomew!

Not too many people are
returning to town.
So business is a little...
But, that must mean the
atmosphere is changing for
the better everywhere in
the country.
Not like before, 
where people were taking
refuge here.
Well if you think about
it that way...
I think things might be
pretty good.
Oh, I keep talking and
talking.
Sorry, hahahaha!

Lately, this town has
gotten lonely.
But I'm stubborn, I
won't close up shop!

Come on in!

Looking for...
    Items
    Accessories
    Nothing

Thank you very much

Come again!

Looking for...
    Items
    Accessories
    Gear parts
    Nothing

Fei
"Oh well, there's nobody 
around.
I guess I'll just leave 
the money here."

    Items
    Accessories
    Nothing

Young master, the old man
from the Gun Room sent me
here for supplies.
If you want, I can also
get Gear parts you may
need. Just tell me.

Bart
"Whoa, good preparations!
If that's the case, please
get the parts we need."

The old man from the
Gun Room sent me
here for supplies.
If you want, I can also
get Gear parts you may
need. Just tell me.

There's no souvenir
shop in this town...
This isn't a
tourist attraction?
I guess not.

Sigh... That guy there...
Once in a while we get
those ignorant types
coming to our town.

They have no idea about
what kind of situation
we're all in.

I hate them...
Those people who are so
ignorant about what's
happening in the world.
Don't tell me you guys
are like that too?

This place has gotten
to be a pain.
My family is fleeing north
to the mountains.
I'm here to buy supplies.

I came here in the hopes
of finding some souvenirs.
In the off chance that
there is some military
clash, I'll hold out and
defend this place.
If Shakhan is crushed, the
country will change.
If that happens I'll go 
home, propose to my girl 
and start a new job.

Hey, aren't you the
young master?

Hey you!

Huh?

Huh!

It's Bartholomew!
Are you doing well?

Bart
"Good enough!"

Don't try to 
overdo it.
Hey, are those your 
friends back there?

Bart
"Yeah.
Fei and Citan."

Friends of the young master
are friends of ours.
Take your time and 
look around.

Bart
"Thanks."

Nisan - Entry - 0778
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Are you ready?"

Bart
"I'll be waiting here,
so call me when you are
ready to go."

Sigurd
"The cave Shakhan is
heading for is directly
west of Nisan.
It's possible the
remainder of his forces
are gathering there."

Sigurd
"There's still some time
until we leave. Why don't
you make preparations?"

Sigurd
"I should have
been honest with
him sooner..."

Citan
"It is best not to
worry about it.
You did all you
could at the time.
The young one will
understand."

Maison
"I am sure the young
master would never have
dreamed of such a tale."

Fei
"...I guess you
already knew?"

Maison
"Well, now that you ask...
yes I did.
However, when Sigurd was
telling his story I thought
it was best to stay quiet.
Please try and help the
young master come to terms
with all that he has just
heard."

Maison
"I have been waiting for
this day for a long time."

Margie
"Be careful."

Margie
"Bart told me.
You're helping out
with the plan too?
So you're caught up
in this now as well?"

Fei
"I've come this far,
so I might as well
stay till the end."

Margie
"Thanks.
I know you'll
do a good job!"

Agnes
"Be careful Bartholomew."

Agnes
"Marguerite and
Bartholomew...
I'm so happy to see
you two getting along
so well."

Margie
"Sister, please stop!
You're embarrassing
me again."

Agnes
"It's not embarrassing.
Since long ago, the Nisan
Mother and King of Aveh
have always...

Margie
"Hey!
Enough about this...
Hey...!
Ouch ouch ouch!"

Bart
"Just sit still
like I said."

Margie
"Ohhhhh!
You're a meanie!"

Sigurd!

Got it!

Elly
"I want to see the
gate's true shape."

Elly
"Let me come too?"
    Okay
    Sorry!

Citan
"Hmm...
Actually, I would
also like to see it.
May I come along?
I promise not to get
in the way."

Citan
"Exchange with me?"
    Sure
    No way

Rico
"This is Shakhan's last.
When he kick's the bucket
things in Kislev and Aveh
should calm down a little.
Everything'll be normal."

Rico
"I'm coming too, okay?"
    Great!
    Well...

Billy
"The 'Ethos' was
controlling two of
the three gates!"

"Will you take me
along too?"
    Alright!
    Sorry, but...

Maria
"Soon we'll be certain
of the gate's true form."

Maria
"Do you want to change?"
    Please
    That's okay

Chu-Chu
"Chu-Chu is raring chu 
go like a big bonfire!
Fei, I'll protect chu
anywhere, in the heart
of a fire or under the
sea chu!"

Chu-Chu
"So I wanna go chu!"
    I guess it's okay
    Sorry!

Traveling?
Surely it is tiring.
You're going to that inn?
I'm sure they'll have good
food for you.

We work in the cathedral
over there.

Fei
"...So you're sisters?"

Yes, that is correct.
We are wandering the land...
searching for the
connection between Nisan
and the outside world.

Sigurd
"Whenever I come here it
always calms my heart."

Sigurd
"Anyway, young master...
I want to work out what our
plans from here on are."

Bart
"Alright.
But before we do that...
there is something I want
to ask you."

Sigurd
"...Me?"

Bart
"Yeah."

Bart
"Sig...
What's up with you and
that Gebler officer?
What's the connection
between you and him...?
You know, you sure know
a lot about Gebler for
some reason!"

Sigurd
"...Alright.
I'll tell you."

Sigurd
"Me and...
Citan, here...
We used to live
in Solaris."

Bart
"Solaris...
...You mean...
where Gebler's from?"

Sigurd
"That's right."

Sigurd
"Solaris...
calls foreigners
'Lambs'...
They are used as manual
labor. Basically it's
slavery."

Bart
"Slavery?"

Fei
"...Lambs..."

Fei
"Elly used that
term earlier too."

Bart
"Is that where
you met him?"

Citan
"Yes, it was there."

Sigurd
"We worked for the
Solaris government
for a short while...
But we learned to
dislike their methods
and escaped the first
chance we had."

Bart
"...You were
friends with
these people?"

Bart
"I met you when I was a kid
and we've been together
ever since then...
So this would have had to
have happened even before
then."

Bart
"I probably wouldn't have
understood this if I had
heard it earlier but...
...Why didn't you think I
could deal with it now?
Surely you could have
told me about this?
Especially when you had
something to do with the
people who are backing
that Shakhan idiot!"

Bart
"I wish you'd
told me sooner."

Sigurd
"...There's nothing I
can do about that now."

Sigurd
"But, there's one thing
I want you to believe...
We left Solaris on our
own will and for our own
reasons.
Now they've appeared
before us, we can't
just sit back and do
nothing.
If need be, I will give
my life to stop them."

Bart
"Alright, I understand.
But can you elaborate
a little more?"

    Where is Solaris?
    What are Lambs?
    Who is that man?
    Why did you leave?

    Ask again
    I understand

Bart
"What bugs me is this
'Surface Dwellers'
thing...
It's as if Solaris is
in another location.
Like up in the clouds
or something?"

Sigurd
"Yes, well..."

Sigurd
"The city of Solaris is
covered by a giant dome.
And guessing from the
scenery that's visible,
I think it's somewhere
up high in the sky."

Bart
"You think...
Didn't you live there?"

Sigurd
"It's completely cut off
from the outside world so
I don't know too well.
There's a special way to
get there from the surface."

Sigurd
"To get to Aveh we stowed
away on a regular flight
to the surface."

Citan
"I came much later
than Sigurd did...
But I also escaped
in the same way."

Sigurd
"That is the word Solarians
use to indicate those who
live on the earth.
As I said before, such
'surface dwellers' or
'earth dwellers' are used
for manual labor there."

Sigurd
"Manual labor could be
anything from soldiers to
administrative jobs.
Solaris gathers its
workforce from the land
dwellers. Jobs are divided
up by who is most suitable.
Sometimes people are
brainwashed."

Bart
"Brainwashed!?"

Sigurd
"I...
When you, young master,
were still an infant...
I was used as a test
subject. There was
probably something they
valued inside of me."

Fei
"You too, doc?"

Citan
"No...
I was born in the lower
city levels. It is not
a complete secret...
But I guess I am a
Solarian..."

Bart
"So why were you collecting
people?
With that much scientific
technology you'd think they
wouldn't need to use
people..."

Citan
"You see...
You still need people
to run a country...
...No matter how
scientifically advanced
you are, you have no
support without people."

Sigurd
"Pure Solarians are rare.
They would not even make
up a quarter of Aveh's
total population.
So, they support their
country by stealing
surface dwellers."

Sigurd
"His name is, Kahr...
Kahran Ramsus.
As you know he's the
Gebler Commander."

Bart
"Ramsus...?"

Sigurd
"We call him Kahr.
In Solaris there is an
officer training school
called 'Jugend'.
He became the commander
after leaving there."

Citan
"He is a lower level
citizen, the same as me.
However, with his amazing
abilities...
After graduating, he rose
through the ranks with
unparalleled speed."

Sigurd
"That man had one ideal.
To achieve a consolidation
of all his colleagues.
Even land dwellers, if they
had talent, were brought
into the army."

Bart
"So you two were
picked by Ramsus...?"

Citan
"No, we were not picked
by him...we aligned
ourselves with him."

Sigurd
"At that time...
we agreed with him."

Citan
"At the time,
Ramsus was our hope.
He had high ideals and
wanted to change the
system in Solaris.
To us test subjects and
lower level citizens,
he was truly all that
we wished for."

Bart
"A benefactor?"

Sigurd
"Yes...even I, a test
subject, was changed
by his ideals."

Bart
"So why was it that
you wanted to flee
from Solaris?"

Sigurd
"We were placed in key
military positions by
Ramsus...
And thanks to that, we came
to know the relationship
between Solaris and the
surface dwellers."

Bart
"You mean...Lambs...?"

Sigurd
"They weren't just using us
'Lambs' for slave labor...
They also selected some of
us, like me, to be used as
subjects in experiments to
refine their drugs...
Drugs that change people's
personalities, to make them
more aggressive and to draw
out their latent abilities.
They were using us as human
guinea pigs to test their
psychological alteration
drugs!"

Bart
"Human guinea pigs...!?
Experimenting on humans?"

Sigurd
"Yes, for example...
'Drive'!
That drug, and all others
like it that are used
now, are by-products of
human experimentation..."

Citan
"However that is not the
test subjects only role."

Fei
"This 'Drive' drug is
something that anyone in
the Solaris army can use?"

Citan
"At least anyone in the
Gebler forces who is sent
to the surface..."

Bart
"You're worried
about her, huh?"

Fei
"...!"

Bart
"I saw some...
in her room."

Fei
"No..."

Bart
"...Anyway...using slaves
as guinea pigs...
How low are these guys...?"

Bart
"Hmm...I think I
get most of it."

Bart
"Old Maison!
Go reserve the town
hall for us. We'll
finish talking there.
I'm going outside to
get some air."

Sigurd
"To get to Aveh we stowed
away on a regular flight
to the surface."

Citan
"I came much later
than Sigurd did...
But I also escaped
in the same way."

Fei
"This 'Drive' drug is
something that anyone in
the Solaris army can use?"

Citan
"At least anyone in the
Gebler forces who is sent
to the surface..."

Bart
"You're worried
about her, huh?"

Fei
"...!"

Bart
"I saw some...
in her room."

Fei
"No..."

Bart
"...Anyway...using slaves
as guinea pigs...
How low are these guys...?"

Bart
"Damn!"

Margie
"Good morning!"

Margie
"What's with the long
face? Not feeling well?
Or are you feeling sad
about saying goodbye?
Or maybe you're just
nervous?"

Bart
"Shut up, stupid!
Don't bug me!"

Margie
"Hee hee."

Margie
"Well...
It's almost time."

Bart
"Yeah, yeah..."

Bart
"Is everyone ready to go?
I'll be waiting here,
so let me know when you
are through preparing."

Bart
"No activites for you.
You'll have to settle
down for awhile."

Margie
"What do you mean,
once in awhile?"

Bart
"Don't get so excited.
Ha ha ha ha!"

Margie
"Meanie!"

Sigurd
"...Alright.
Please tell Maison we'll
be here a while longer."

Sigurd
"We've heard from our
units in Bledavik.
Things are unfolding
smoothly.
They have entered the
castle.
They are investigating
Shakhan's private room
on the top floor of the
castle.
One more thing, Yggdrasil
is on station nearby and
has picked up several
Gears on radar."

Bart
"Shakhan!"

Sigurd
"Most certainly.
But those Gears went to
the capital then turned
and came back toward us."

Fei
"He saw things weren't
looking too good and
ran away."

Bart
"Yeah.
But it sounds like he's
coming back here."

Fei
"What's here...?"

Sigurd
"About that,
the info from the
capital...
Isn't there a -Gate-
in the area?"

Fei
"A -Gate-?"

Citan
"Where?"

Sigurd
"Directly west of Nisan."

Sigurd
"Young master, do you know
the big cave over there?"

Bart
"Cave...
On the western continent?
It's near the ocean.
If I remember it's big
enough for a Gear to walk
into."

Sigurd
"Yes, there.
They found evidence that
there is some large
building inside that cave."

Fei
"Shakhan is heading for
there..."

Fei
"What's he doing?"

Bart
"I guess we'll have
to go and see!"

Fei
"Okay!"

Sigurd
"I'll wait here for
info from the capital."

Citan
"A gate!
Of course I would like to
actually see it...but this
time I will pass.
There are two more left...
And besides...
Just in case things do not
go well, it might be better
if we stay here and protect
Marguerite."

Bart
"Got it.
I leave the rest to you!"

    Alright!

Continuing our pilgrimage
from the south, we finally
arrived a few days ago.

Walking around the desert
is hard work!

Is the rumor that there
are pirates in the Royal
Capital true?

Through a special
arrangement with the town
representatives, we're
getting lodging.

I'm very sorry but
we're all full.
As an apology please
accept this...

 Special Herb Tea!

 Reduced weight a bit 

Come again!

We are providing you
with a vacant house.
    Okay, understood!
    What's that there?

Huh?
...That?
I'm so glad you like it!
Please take it.

 Special Herb Tea!

We are providing you
with a vacant house.

Welcome!
Since you're the ones who
saved our town we'll let
you stay for free.

Stay here?
    Yes
    No

Thank you!
Come again

Bart
"Let's split up!
I'll go to the mausoleum.
I'll take Fei and..."

Bart
"I see, that'll be good.
Then please go help Sig!"

"So, if that's the case
then..."

Bart
"Alright! That decides it!
Everyone else cooperate
with Sig!"

Bart
"Huh?
You don't have to...
Oh, yeah.
Sorry Margie.
Come along with us."

Bart
"Alright I'm counting
on all of you!
He's a dead man the
next time I see him!"

How's Bledavik?

It's under martial law so
it's gotten progressively
harder to contact our
agents in the city.
According to the info we
finally got just a while
ago, there's no major
activity.
We think they've found
some reason to attack and
are getting ready now..."

The possiblity exists.

However I've heard that
Shakhan's powerbase in the
capital is erroding away.
He's probably weaker than
we thought.

Anyway, it's happened and
we're committed now.

I feel the same way.

Now that I think about it,
12 years ago...

Ever since the coup d'etat
by Shakhan, there's been
a lot of tension in our
country.
With Marguerite back now, 
I agree that the former
dynasty should be returned
to power.

Everyone feels the same
but we must look at reality.
Do we have the strength to
do that now?

Now I hear Bartholomew,
the one who brought back
Marguerite, has started
moving around out in the
open. I'm certain Shakhan
is preparing a large army.

Shakhan may be coming
here soon...

... 

What's gonna happen to us
if he captures this area?

Will everyone be killed?

I seriously doubt that.
Even he won't want to risk
provoking any kind of
outrage with the citizens.
Especially in this
situation, he will
definitely want to avoid
putting himself in a
compromising situation.

We should set up a hiding
place just in case...

Maybe there...

Sigurd
"I went to the tool shop
to borrow a table.
The owner said...
'if we need anything for
the young master, just
ask for it.'"

Bart
"I'm grateful."

Bart
"When I was a kid, I
borrowed stuff from there
and got in big trouble."

Fei
"Borrowed...
What did you take?

Bart
"A toy boat.
...I think that's what
it was.
I put fireworks in it and
let it float on the
cathedral's lake. I always
used to play 'navy'."

Bart
"I'm not sure, but I
think I pretended the
lake was the open sea...
...and I was the fleet
commander."

Bart
"Anyway...forget those
old stories.
We should get started."

Bart
"First...
Gebler is the
big problem."

Citan
"Yes, Ramsus is headed
towards achieving his
goals.
That he is now the
commander of Gebler
is proof of that.
A normal man could not
progress so quickly
through that country's
organization.
And now he is presently
located here in Ignas."

Citan
"Frankly, the situation
is not very favorable.
We need to somehow find
a weak spot and attack
it with all our might."

Bart
"First, let's just
concentrate on Shakhan.
Once he's out of the way
and Aveh is safe again,
we can think about how
to deal with Gebler."

Bart
"With our present strength
we should be able to hold
off the royal guard forces.
The problem is how to deal
with Gebler in the mean
time...
They will most likely move
at Shakhan's request.
They're not just gonna sit
by and watch quietly."

Citan
"...May I have a
look there please?"

Citan
"In short, we want Gebler
to leave for a while...
At least until we are able
to take back the Royal
Capital, Bledavik."

Sigurd
"But the problem is...
will attacking the border
guards be enough to set
the center in motion?"

Citan
"To be sure then, Nisan
will just have to appear
to align with Kislev.
If they see it that way,
they will certainly make
a move."

Bart
"You're saying that you
intend to use Nisan as
bait?"

Fei
"Doc!?"

Sigurd
"Shakhan is very
sensitive to Nisan's
and Kislev's actions.
If Nisan starts moving
he will probably leave
it up to Gebler, but..."

Citan
"Of course I do not
wish to do that from
the beginning.
But looking at the
situation, we have to
be willing to go that
far."

Hmm...

Bart
"First, we infiltrate
into the capital.
To take out Shakhan,
we'll have to meet
up with our agents
already in the city."

Citan
"We are forgetting
one thing...
The front line units
along Kislev's border."

Bart
"...!"

Bart
"Damn...
That puts everything
in jeopardy!"

Citan
"Do not feel so down.
I simply wanted you
to see the current 
distribution of force
in the area.
Even in the worst case
that they do come, it
will not be such a great
problem."

Bart
"What do you mean?"

Citan
"I have some additional
information about Aveh's
border fleet.
The former Aveh supreme
commander was transferred
there.
Not really transferred,
more like demoted...
His name is Vanderkaum."

Sigurd
"Vanderkaum..."

Sigurd
"You don't mean the
Vanderkaum that was
in Jugend?"

Citan
"The very same."

Citan
"Young one, he has not been
able to adapt to the change
in tactics...
particularly following the
introduction of Gears...
He is a man who will never
stray from his dependence
on large naval guns."

Bart
"You mean, he's stubborn.
He is all size and no
real military power.
An excellent target for
pirates."

Maison
"Young master!
This is not going to
be an act of piracy!"

Bart
"Just kidding."

Citan
"Actually, the number of
Gears assigned to the fleet
seems to have been reduced."

Citan
"Even with that...
how gallant of him to
be so self-righteous."

Bart
"Is he that much of
a muscle head? It'll
be fun taunting him."

Maison
"Young master!"

Bart
"I know! I know!
Anyway, Citan, do you
think he can strike
our Gear forces?"

Citan
"It is not a problem.
Even with Vanderkaum, we
have enough forces left
to pull off the feint.
However, it would not be
wise to underestimate our
opponents."

Fei
"Me...!?"

Sigurd
"Hold on now!
There's no reason to
involve you all in this!"

Fei
"...I'll do it.
Yes, let me do it.
When do we leave?"

Bart
"...Are you sure?"

Fei
"We've come this far...
Hey, we're friends to
the end, now!"

Citan
"Speed is everything.
We should do this as
soon as possible."

Bart
"Alright, tomorrow!"

Sigurd
"I am truly grateful...
Fei...
Citan."

Bart
"Yeah!"

Bart
"There's no way we
can lose! No one
will die in vain!"

Maison
"Well put,
young master!"

Margie
"You okay?
Sister, are you wounded?"

Sister Agnes
"I'm fine. 
Marguerite and Bartholomew,
I'm sorry..."

Sigurd
"I took some troops and
searched the area, but I
couldn't find anyone."

Bart
"Really?"

Sister Agnes
"Earlier, 
after everyone came out..."

Sister Agnes
"Over half of the
residents have fled
from Nisan.
After that, Shakhan's
position in the country
was compromised so...
he didn't care about
reputations anymore and
attacked this land."

Citan
"I see. 
A last desperate plan to
reverse the situation..."

Bart
"Sister, I assume the
people remaining in the
town are...?"

Sister Agnes
"Yes. 
Hiding in the mausoleum."

Fei
"Mausoleum...?
Hiding in a grave?"

Margie
"The Great Mothers and
Kings of Aveh of old
are revered there."

Bart
"It's not just some regular
grave or anything."

Sister Agnes
"Bartholomew,
about that..."

Sister Agnes
"Shakhan and
the Fatima Jasper...
He's after the Fatima
Treasure."

Citan
"Treasure...? If he
wants the treasure what is
he doing attacking here..."

Bart
"Huh? Ahh..."

Bart
"Actually, the Fatima
Treasure is in the
mausoleum.
There was even father's
will there, but I didn't
tell anyone..."

Fei
"Treasure...
You mean that thing in the
picture scrolls you showed
me earlier in your base?"

Bart
"Yeah.
If you follow that legend,
you're supposed to get
your hands on some great
power."

Sigurd
"We must stop them
somehow."

Bart
"There's no problem.
The Jasper is..."

Sister Agnes
"They plan to use the
former Mother's retinas."

Bart
"Wha...what!!"

Sister Agnes
"Remove the deceased
Mother's retina, and
break the seal."

Bart
"Use the body of Margie's
mother?"

Margie
"Mom's...!!"

Sister Agnes
"I'm sorry. They used
innocent citizens and sect
followers as a shield.
There was no other way...
The truth we heard
previously from Margie
about the Jasper's true
form and how it's used.
They know now...
I am truly sorry."

Bart
"Well...
I don't blame you.
They had hostages!"

Citan
"Wait a moment.
Retinas...what are you
speaking of?"

Bart
"The Fatima Jasper is the
topaz blue pupils of the
Fatima dynasty...
In other words...
our retinal pattern.
The doors to the treasure
are opened by that...
Or so it is said."

Bart
"However no one has ever
used it. It's not to be
used for minor conflicts.
The doors are to be opened
only when the kingdom is
truly in danger.
So neither I, 
nor my father, 
nor grandfather,
nor my great grandfather
have ever used it."

Citan
"So, that is the true
form of the Jasper..."

Bart
"Damn!"

Bart
"That old coot, he wants to
profane a holy person's
corpse? That's unthinkable!"

Citan
"It is a closely guarded
secret but the 'Ethos'
people are not holy men.
They simply supervise."

Fei
"Yes, of course they
wouldn't feel anything!
Let's go Bart!
Before the mausoleum is
trashed."

Bart
"Alright!"

Sigurd
"Young master!
I have a proposal."

Bart
"What is it Sig?"

Sigurd
"Currently Aveh is in
confusion with Shakhan
running amok.
It should be very easy
to bring down the center
with no Gebler units
around.
It'll be the best time to
make our return to the
capital."

Citan
"That is a good idea.
Shakhan is most likely
thinking of the Fatima
Jasper as his last card.
While we prevent the young
one from handing over the
treasure to Shakhan...
a separate force will take
back the capital.
Then he will have nowhere
else to go."

Bart
"I got it...
Sounds good.
We can pay everything
back in one shot!"

    Elly
    Citan
    Billy
    Rico
    Maria
    Chu-Chu

Elly
"Fine, I'll go."

Citan
"If possible, I would like
to return to the capital
with Sigurd.
Two former Solarians will
dethrone the 'Ethos'...
How very ironic."

Billy
"I'll go."

Rico
"Leave it to me."

Maria
"I will help out."

Chu-Chu
"There's no choice 
but for me chu go!"

    Elly
    Billy
    Rico
    Maria
    Chu-Chu

Elly
"I'll go."

Billy
"I'll go."

Rico
"Leave it to me."

Maria
"I will help out."

Chu-Chu
"There's no choice
but for me chu go!"

Margie
"Hold on.
I'm going too!"

Recapture Aveh - Nisan Meeting Lodge - Planning Map - 0784
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"These are the Gebler 
units currently in Aveh, 
correct?"

Citan
"The western guards..."

Citan
"the Royal Capital
defense force..."

Citan
"and...units along
the front line at the
border with Kislev."

Citan
"There are three main
groups.
Each is made up of a
mix of Gebler and Aveh
forces. Only two of
these are very large."

Citan
"The Royal Capital's
defense units and the
Kislev border units.
The western guard along
Nisan's border are little
more than a surveillence
team."

Sigurd
"In order to recapture
the Royal Capital...
...it will be necessary
to draw these defense
units away from Bledavik."

Citan
"We have some Kislev
made Gears, correct?"

Bart
"Yeah, we captured 
some earlier."

Citan
"What if we use those
Gears to make a raid on
the western guards...
...here at the border
with Nisan?"

Bart
"I see. We'll draw them
out by making it look like
Kislev is invading Aveh."

Citan
"The main strength of
Aveh's fleet is the
battleship Kefeinzel.
It's been in service
since the reign of
the last king.
Because of its fire-
power, the whole unit
is nicknamed the
'invincible fleet'.
I recall yesterday's
intelligence report
said that the ship
is near the border."

Sigurd
"Well, now that we know
what we are up against,
here's what we'll do..."

Sigurd
"Apart from our main unit
heading for Bledavik...
we must keep the fleet
at the Kislev border from
returning to the capital."

Bart
"So you're suggesting
we have another unit?"

Citan
"A few effective soldiers
to hold the enemy at bay...
A small force is best."

Sigurd
"A small force...?"

Citan
"What if Fei leads a
group of Gears there?"

Nisan - Meditating in a Dark Room??? - 0786
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meditating in a dark room
can clear your mind.

Whatever happens, I'll
never move from here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0788 - Nisan - Fei's memory??
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually Nisan is a
pretty popular place
among artists.
Part of the reason is the
scenery but it's mostly
because of the portrait
of the Great Mother that
is said to be in the
cathedral.
Unfortunately, the public
is not permitted to go
see it.

No...something's not right.

...Sorry, but please
don't talk to me now.
Yesterday morning's view
from the lake.
I'm remembering the
sensation of that light.

...I forgot.

Oh...I'm remebering.

I got it!

I was thinking of putting
the arrival of a new era
into a picture.

Fei
(Paint brushes...
I haven't touched them
since I left the village.)

Hm?...Are you
an artist too?

Fei
"Ah...no..."

Oh...pictures
are great.

Fei
"Oh...
Oh, really..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0790 - Nisan - Royal Gate Guard
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I alternate gate duty
with the guy outside.

You people...
You're not residents here.
I know from your aura.
I too, once lived near
the Royal Capital.
I swindled people using
fake goods when I lived
there.
I came to hate doing
those things...
Then I heard of this place
from some pilgrims.
I alternate gate duty
with the guy outside but,
it's pretty interesting.
Everyday I see the
pilgrim's faces and get
impressions, like
this person is very
troubled, ...and such.
I used to use that
ability to get money
from people...
Now I'd never think of 
doing that.

I'm from the royal army
stationed down south.
I may work for the current
government but my heart
belongs to Nisan. I cannot
desert it.
I hear there are lots of
people like me who are
gathering here.
The residents here are
kindly renting me this
room...
Now I'm waiting here
until something starts
happening.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nisan Bridge - 0792
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Margie
"Wow!
It's been such a long
time since I left here."

Citan
"Well...
First of all, we should
accompany Marguerite up
to meet the sisters!"

Bart
"...Huh?
What is it old Maison?"

Maison
"Sniff...
Goodness gracious me...!
To think that little Miss
Marguerite was finally
able to return here...
...
It is so awfully moving!"

Bart
"H...hey!
Pull yourself together,
old man!"

Maison
"F...forgive me.
How terribly embarrassing!
I couldn't help it..."

Maison
"I...
I shall go back and give
some instructions to the
men left on the ship.
Please, young master,
go ahead and escort
Miss Marguerite up to
see the sisters.
...Excuse me now."

Bart
"Please, don't either of
you talk about this in
front of Margie...
She's only just got back
from her long time in
captivity...
I don't want her to have
to worry...
I want her to be happy 
for a little longer."

Citan
"You should not be overly
worried yourself!
You have just got to think
about what is best for the
future of this land...
What is done is done!
You only did what you
believed was right...
Put the past behind you."

Bart
"Huh...
I'm alright!"

  Sigurd
  "Etrenank, the captial
  of the Solaris empire is
  located in the skies above.
  Solaris is separated from
  the land by dimensional
  distortion fields known
  as 'Gates'.
  Passing between the two
  requires special means of
  transportation...
  such as an airship."

  Sigurd
  "We were placed in key
  military positions by
  Ramsus...
  And thanks to that, we came
  to know the relationship
  between Solaris and the
  surface dwellers."

  Bart
  "The...'Lambs'...right?

       Sigurd
       "They weren't just using us
       'Lambs' for slave labor...
       They also selected some of
       us, like me, to be used as
       subjects in experiments to
       refine their drugs...
       Drugs that change people's
       personalities, to make them
       more aggressive and to draw
       out their latent abilities.
       They were using us as human
       guinea pigs to test their
       psychological alteration
       drugs!"

  Bart
  "Human guinea pigs...!?
  Experimenting on humans?"

  Sigurd
  "Yes, for example...

               'Drive'

     That drug, and all others
     like it that are used
     now, are by-products of
     human experimentation..."

     Citan
     "However, the role of such
     experimental subjects was
     not limited to just that!"

Citan
"There is a new wind
blowing today..."

Sigurd
"Well, we will go ahead
and prepare the ship for
launch."

The town representatives
have been meeting at the
assembly hall since this
morning.

I hear it is because
Marguerite has returned...
They are trying to decide
how to deal with Aveh as
the 'Nisan parish'.

I can understand why
everyone is worried.
But the Great Mother
has finally returned...
We should be celebrating,
shouldn't we?

Margie
"These are the people
who took care of me
when I was small."

Margie
"I won't be able to call
you 'young master' the
next time I see you.
It'll probably have to
be 'Your Majesty'...
But it doesn't quite
sound right, does it?"

Bart
"Whatever...
It doesn't matter."

Maison
"The people of Nisan were
most generous to allow us
to rent this house.
So there will be no need
to seek lodgings at the
inn for a while.
Also, Master Sigurd
wishes a word with you
regarding your next move,
if he may..."

Bart
"Alright...
So where is Sig?"

Maison
"The good Master Sigurd is
 waiting for you inside."

Bart
"Okay, thanks Maison."

Maison
"Master Sigurd awaits
you inside, sir..."

Bart
"Ah!"

Maison
"Yo-ung ma--ste-r!"

Bart
"I had no idea Sig 
had such a past..."

Citan
"Are you still
suspicious of
Sigurd...?"

Bart
"Well...I mean...
it was just so sudden.
I kind of expected to hear
something different...
like that we were childhood
rivals or something...
But that's nothing compared
to the story he just told
us, is it?"

Citan
"Hmm. So hearing his story
has you confused because it
was not so simple...
There was a time when he
was cooperating with one
of Gebler's generals...
Furthermore, behind Gebler
was a country that you had
never even heard of..."

Bart
"Hey, what are you
picking on me for?"

Citan
"No I am not picking on you
or blaming anything on you.
What I am saying is this...
If you think about how he
feels, then you should see
why he could not talk about
this with you till now."

Citan
"Looking at the activities
of Solaris toward other
countries up until now...
...It has never gone
beyond simply maintaining
their own empire, or
'self-preservation'.
And as you have seen, their
military power is immense.
So Sigurd was probably
thinking ahead...
First he was probably
concentrating on taking
care of the problems here
on the continent of Ignas.
Once things were settled
here, it would give him
a stronger foundation to
deal with Solaris later.
Which is a much better plan
than rushing straight into
a war he knew we could not
win. Quite logical, really.

Bart
"Sounds like you understand
one another pretty well."

Citan
"Well it is not like we are
newly acquainted, is it?
And we had talked about a
lot of things up until we
decided to escape from
Solaris."

Bart
"Speaking of that...
Why did you leave?
That Ramsus guy was
supposed to be a 'Star
of Hope' or something,
wasn't he?"

Citan
"Yes, I certainly thought
so at first.
But then I realized his way
of thinking really was not
that much of a change from
the previous system.
Basically, the only
difference was whether they
stressed people's rank and
class, or their skill.
The words had changed, but
it was still no different
from what Solaris itself
had been doing until then.
He had no intentions of
bringing everyone a
better way of life."

Bart
"In other words, he's an
elitist. I don't think
I like him much either."

Bart
"So, Citan...
Do you think I can
beat Gebler?"

Citan
"Why? Are you planning
on fighting them?"

Bart
"As long as they're
working with Shakhan,
there's no way around it.
The way things are going,
I'm sure we'll have to
fight them sooner or
later."

Citan
"Hmm...
I suppose so, but...
Even if we were to defeat
the Gebler forces here,
there is still Solaris,
to deal with.
If we are not careful, it
is possible that we may get
involved in a longer war
than that with Shakhan.
Do you not agree that
continuing the way we
have been going is rather
hard on everyone?
I think it is time we
try to get help from
a greater number of
people."

Bart
"So defeating Shakhan's
not going to get rid of
the likes of Gebler..."

Bart
"I know what you're
trying to say...
'To vanquish Gebler,
first gain thy throne!'
...Right?"

Citan
"Hmm...
You could put it that way."

Bart
"What do you mean...
'You could put it that
way'?
But then again, maybe it
is time I did something
about that."

This road leads
to the cathedral.

Oh, Bart!
I'm glad you're well.

I've already contacted the
monastery.
Please take Margie up
there as soon as possible.
She'll be so happy...
not to mention the sisters!

Margie
"I must hurry and
see the sisters."

I've already contacted
the monastery.
Go to them quickly and
show them you're alright.
I'm sure they'll be
happy to see you!

Welcome back!

The people at the hidden
port contacted us just
before you came into town.

I'm so glad you're safe!

My dad always says,
"It's peaceful here."...
But what is 'peace' anyway?
I don't really understand.

Mr. Pirate!

Will you let me ride
in your ship someday?

Bart
"Hahaha!
Maybe when you get a
little older, kid!"

Are bad people
coming to get us?

Hey, you're a stranger,
aren't you?
My mom said that there
are lots of strangers
who do bad things, so
I should be careful.
Are you a bad person?

Margie has come back!

My dad was saying that
there was going to be
a war, so we should
move somewhere else.

How's my young lord going?

Bart
"Don't call me
'young lord'!"

(Oh! I forgot...
Your true identity is
supposed to be a secret.
There's only a handful
of people in this town
who know who you are...
I'll be more careful,
my young lord!
...Oops.)

If it isn't my young lord!
I hear you gave them quite
a show this time!

Bart
(Shhh! Keep it down!
My true identity is
supposed to be a secret!
What if a spy from the
Royal Capital snuck in
here and heard you!?)

(Oh... I hadn't
thought about that!)

My young lord!
I've heard that the
time has finally come.
But now I won't be
able to call you my
young lord anymore...
...Your Majesty!

Bart
"Well...let's keep it as
young lord. 'Your Majesty'
is going a bit too far!
Not that I'm suited to,
or like to be called,
either title anyway!"

How are you,
my young lord?
I knew you'd come
back in one piece!

Are you a pilgrim?
Young pilgrims like
you are very rare.

How is my young lord?
I knew you'd all
come back alive!

You're friends of my young
lord, right? Since you are
friends with him, I'm sure
you already know, but...
He'll be the leader of this
country one day!
I had a chance to take care
of him when he was small.
That's why I call him my
'young lord'.
Please look after him for
me!

You should try new things
while you're still young!
If you don't expand your
horizons, you'll regret
it when you get old.

So you're going to make
your move eh, Bartholomew?
But somehow I don't think
that man's just going to
stand by and let you do
as you please though.

Fei
"That man?"

Bart
"He means 'Shakhan'!"

Yes.
It's alright to try and
avenge your father...
...but I don't think
things will be that
easy, though!

Bart
"I don't want to
hurt anyone.
I want you to know
I'm always thinking
about that."

Do your best!

You should try new things
while you're still young!
If you don't expand your
horizons, you'll regret
it when you get old.

I've had enough troubles.
I just want to live life
peacefully.

You must be from another land.
How's the outside world?
Rumor has it that political
instability is growing...
But that's hardly surprising,
given the current governments.

So it has finally begun.
My late father always said,
"Don't miss the greater
happiness by being misled
by minor sufferings."!
It hurts me to see our
children placed in danger.
But if it moves our country
in the right direction,
then it's in their benefit.

Ahh, it's such a nice day.

Oh, so you're the ones?
Everyone in town is
talking about you!
Something about the
Great Mother returning...
Since they call her the
Great Mother she must
be really old and frail!

I had no idea...
Why, the Great Mother
is younger than I am!?
I'm new here, so I don't
know much...
I don't know exactly what
is going on, but let's just
avoid any trouble now, okay!?

This land...
extends aaaaall the way
around the lake...
Which extends aaaaall the
way around the cathedral.
Just for fun, you might
want to go aaaaall the
way around it yourself.
Not that there's much to
see at aaaaall, mind you.

It does the heart good
to see the innocent
play of children.

Most of the families with
children have evacuated.
They were afraid of getting
caught up in a battle here.
It's so lonely now.
How I miss them...

No matter where you
go in this world,
war is everywhere.
This town could be the
only place that isn't
involved in conflict.

The town representatives
have been in discussion
at the assembly hall
since this morning.

I hear they're talking
about a plan to deal with
the troops from Aveh.
Some of them think the
return of Margie is a
nuisance.

I can understand why
everyone is worried.
But shouldn't we be counting
our blessings that the Great
Mother resides in Nisan...?

The town representatives have
finished their discussions
and are moving into action.
They have dispersed to
prepare their defenses and
accommodations for the
residents desiring to escape.

May heaven protect you all.

Neither of us serve
heaven within the
Nisan cathedral...
But we pray here daily,
as ones who have lived
here for many years.

May all things be
as heaven wills...

God bless you. And I wish
you good fortune too.

I'll get you!

I'm gonna get you!

Outta the way,
outta the way!

Outta the way!
Outta the way!

 Studio 

They're continuing their
discussion in there.

Nisan - Overworld? - 0794
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Margie
"Then I'll be waiting
here for you."

Bart
"Thanks for waiting!"

Margie
"Alright, let's go in!"

Nisan

Nisan Cathedral

World Map

Secret Dock

    With the help of Fei and his
    colleagues, Nisan was freed
        from Shakhan's army.
     However, the Fatima Jasper
     and the legendary treasures
       of the Aveh royal family
        were still in danger.
     And now, he's going to play
     his last card and Shakhan's
       true intentions will be
          brought to light.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0796 - Nisan - Margie Returns
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Margie!

Margie!

Margie
"I'm back, everyone!"

Oh, Margie...
We're so glad you're safe...

Margie
"Yes, it is all thanks
to Bart and his men."

We just received word...
So we were singing a
hymn of praise and joy.
We're so happy...
Oh, what a relief!

Sister Agnes
"Welcome back, Margie.
We had faith that you and
your cousin Bart would one
day return safely...
We and your other friends
have been waiting for you."

Margie
"Sister Agnes!"

Sister Agnes
"Unfortunately, your
mother and the blessed
Royal Mother..."

Margie
"I know, Sister Agnes...
I heard about it at
the Royal Capital..."

Margie
"...But at least I
have made it back...
I'll never go anywhere,
or leave you from now on!
I won't make you all worry
anymore...ever again!"

Sister Agnes
"Bless you my dear..."

Margie
"Sister Agnes, this just
isn't like you at all!
Here I am back
safe and sound.
Can't you rebuke
me just a little,
for old time's sake?"

Sister Agnes
"Ha...
I'm sorry...
But I'm just so
happy that I cannot
help but..."

"Sister..."

Sister Agnes
"...There is no reason
to be so solemnly quiet..."

Margie
"...Thank you,
and bless you all!"

Margie
"Oh, yes, Sister...
May I go upstairs?
It's been oh so long,
so I want to have a look
around up there too."

Sister Agnes
"Oh, but of course, dear!
Don't even think of holding
back from anything...
Except for one thing...
Never stay away so long
like that again."

Margie
"Ha, ha!
I knew you'd say that.
Now that's the Agnes
I know!'

"Margie, I am so glad."

Bart
"It's been a while since
the last time I was here."

Bart
"...?
Something wrong, Margie?"

Margie
"...Nothing.
It's just..."

Margie
"I guess I got a 
little emotional...
Heh, heh, heh..."

Bart
"..."

Bart
"Anyhow, take it
easy for a while.
...You've put up
with enough, okay."

Margie
"...If you are trying to
make me cry, you'll fail."

Margie
"Oh yes!
I'll show Fei and Citan
around our cathedral...
Follow me!"

Citan
"What a strong
girl she is...
It is obvious that she
really wants to just
break down and cry..."

Bart
"Yeah, you're right...
That's just the way
she has always been.
For all her talk, she
understands her position
well...
Maybe there are a few
things I could learn
from her too."

Citan
"...How magnificent!"

Margie
"If we ever got scolded
for pranks as kids, Bart
and I used to hide here."

Bart
"Hey, stop telling
those old stories.
It's embarrassing!"

Margie
"But to me, Bart hasn't
changed much since then."

Bart
"What!?
You mean that you think
I'm still a kid!?"

Margie
"I like the view from
here the best."

Citan
"Yes, this is
breathtaking!"

Citan
"Light from outside shining
through the stained glass
of the cathedral's front...
What a brilliant piece of
artistry this is."

Margie
"Did you notice that the
two great angels only
have one wing each...?"

   According to a legend
  handed down in Nisan...
  God could have created
    humans perfectly...
But then, humans would not
 have helped each other...
So that is what these great
   single-winged angels
       symbolizes...
 In order to fly, they are
 dependent on one another.

Citan
"Ah, so that is the
reason for it.
I see...
On further inspection,
the left angel looks
somewhat masculine...
...while the right one
looks somewhat feminine."

Citan
"Now that is an unusual
feature, is it not?"

Citan
"Usually these depictions
are not gender-specific.
But these angels are
clearly distinguishable as
having opposing genders."

Citan
"And the space between
them is the path from
where god advents..."

Citan
"Or could it be the
path leading to god?
Well...I do not know,
it could be either,
or even both."

Citan
"...Now I see!"

Citan
"This all coincides with
the teachings of Nisan."

Margie
"Ha, ha, ha!
Why Doctor Citan Uzuki!
You are an amusing fellow!"

Citan
"Oh!
Excuse me.
It is a habit of mine..."

Fei
"The doc knows a lot
about a lot of things...
Sometimes I can't even
understand what he's
talking about..."

Bart
"...Hah!
Forcing them to fly
together...?
It would be less
bothersome if they
could fly on their own,
don't you think, Fei?"

Margie
"Bart!
You miss the deeper meaning
and beauty of it!"

Margie
"Someday I wish I could
be of help to someone
like that..."

Margie
"Oh, we haven't visited
the 'Room of Sophia' yet,
have we?
You're really supposed to
go through some procedures
before you can see it...
But this time I think it
will be alright if I make
a special exception."

Fei
"Sophia?"

Margie
"Yes, Sophia.
She is revered as the
founding mother of the
Nisan nation...
and the founder of the
Nisan religion who set
forth its teachings.
There is a special
room upstairs that
has a portrait of
Mother Sophia in it."

Citan
"I would definitely like
to view that! Fei, let us
go have a look at it!

Margie
"We go up to the gallery
on the second floor from
here..."

Sister Agnes
"Well, everyone!"

Sister Agnes
"To celebrate the return
of our dear sister Margie...
and to express our joy to
heaven, let us finish
singing our hymn."

(...You must have
been through so much
at the Royal Capital...)

No unauthorized persons
   beyond this point.

To come here when you
are so young is a sign
of your interest!

( ... )

Hey, hey!
Don't go up there
like that!

I moved from another
town to live here...
But they say some young
people do the opposite
and move away from here.
I wonder if it is because
they want something more
than peace in their hearts?
I guess that is just how
young people are today!

My husband was a soldier in
the Royal Capital's army...
But he died a few years back,
near the border of Kislev.
Since then, I have been
coming here every year on
the anniversary of his death.

I live in the Royal Capital,
but my oh my..., this was
definitely worth the trip!
I never knew it was
so beautiful!

Who's that guy you're with?
What's his problem...!?
(... 'castle fetish'!?)

Fei
"Huh?
Ah... Maybe...
I think."

I live in the Royal Capital,
but my oh my..., this was
definitely worth the trip!
I never knew it was
so beautiful!

Bart
(Hmm...
Yes you're right!)

Fatima Castle is no
comparison to this.

Bart
(Hmm...
Yes you're... What!)

Bart
"Hey you!
Are you putting
down Fatima Castle!?"

No, I didn't mean that...

Who is this guy!?

Fei
"H, hey! Bart!"

Bart
"Don't you be dissin' me.
You don't even know
who you're looking at!"

Bart
"Damn... Never mind,
just forget it!"

I'm on a pilgrimage all
over this country, and
recently traveled to the
Royal Capital area.
I just got back here a
few days ago, but will
probably be leaving here
again in a few days time.

I want to see with my
own eyes what will
become of this country.

Preparations should be starting
near the border of this sect's
country for the charge by
the Royal Capital's army.
But a miscalculated move
directed on the enemy is
certain to backfire
on us, so we'll be taking covert
action for a while.
I'm on my way there now, but I
thought I'd offer a prayer
before I go.

As a matter of fact, the
guy next to me and I were
born here.
Years ago, we both got
tired of the peaceful but
boring life here, so we
ran away from home.
But we both ended up
enlisting in the army.
It's not that we have any
particularly happy memories
or whatever here...
it's just that, after all,
this is the land of our
birth, so well y'know...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0798 - Recapture Aveh - Nisan
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigurd
"Our comrades in Nisan will
hit the western guard in
Kislev uniforms as planned.
We'll wait for the right
moment, then head for the
palace in the Yggdrasil!"

Bart
"Got it.
But avoid any unnecessary
deaths.
This especially goes for
the Aveh troops and also
the people from Gebler."

Sigurd
"Yes.
We understand."

Fei
"I guess I'm going to
raise some hell in my
Weltall then."

Sigurd
"We're counting on you!"

Margie
"Next time we meet I won't
be able to call you 'Bart'
or 'young master'.
Maybe, 'Your Majesty'...?"

Bart
"Cut it out.
Bart's fine...
'Great Mother of Nisan'!"

Margie
"Hey...!
You know I hate
that title!"

Bart
"Ha ha ha!"

Bart
"Well, we're outta here!"

Margie
"Okay.
Good luck!"

Agnes
"Marguerite and 
Bartholomew...
Seeing you two
brings my hopes
up."

Agnes
"Long ago before the Fatimas
of Aveh were called Fatima...
The royal brothers and their
wives oversaw many prosperous
reigns or eras.
I'm looking forward to the
day, when as the Great Mother
of the Nisan Sect...
you will take your place on
the throne as Bartholomew's
wife."

Margie
"What!? Hey, hold on!
I hate talking about
queens and romance...!
Bart and I are best
friends!"

Agnes
"Ha ha, marriage IS
the best friendship."

Agnes
"Well Marguerite, at the
rate that you are maturing
into a beautiful woman...
...I don't think Bart will
be able to ignore you much
longer."

Margie
"Stop it, you're
embarrassing me!"

Sigurd
"I'll complete the
remaining checks
onboard.
I'll leave the
rest up to you,
Maison."

Maison
"As you wish...
I will have the honor of
accompanying the others."

Bartholomew, healthy
as ever I hope?

Bart
"Yeah.
How's the town?"

Since we got word several
days ago that there might
be an army advancing from
the Royal Capital the
Sect's representatives
have been in discussion.

Bart
"What have they
come up with?"

For now, they just plan to
improve the local defenses.
Also, anti-Shakhan people
have been gathering here...
probably because they heard
about what's going on.

Bart
"That's reassuring."

Yes.
However the residents are
starting to feel uneasy.
People are starting to
take refuge up north
in the mountains.

Bart
"Can't blame them."

By the way, how's 
Marguerite...?

Bart
"Better than we thought.
But I know she was in a
lot of grief."

Marguerite!
I'm so glad
you're safe.

Margie
"Thanks."

All the townspeople are
overjoyed by the Great
Mother's return.

(.........
......zzz

...o...Oh!!

N, no problems, sir!!

No problems, sir!!

Board the ship?
    Yes
    No

Preparations for the
campaign are done, just
finishing one final check.
The young master is
taking Marguerite to
Nisan.

Everything is ready.

No problems sir!!

The sisters are waiting
in the cathedral.

Welcome back.

    Leave port now
    To the bridge

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nisan Cathedral - 0800
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Margie
"The sisters are still
singing downstairs, so they
won't be back for a while."

Margie
"Let's go to the
painting room.
The sisters will
probably be back
by then."

Margie
"I wonder what kind
of person Sophia was.
I would have loved to
have met her."

I've got do my best too!

A new era is approaching...
I've got to do my best too!

Everyone is alive!
Thank god.

We're transcribing scrolls.
Scrolls over 100 years old
get worn, so we renew them.
It is one of our daily
tasks.

Take care now!

Just because the monarchy
has been abolished, it
does not mean that peace
will automatically prevail.
From now on, citizens must
build this country anew
with their own hands.
Undoubtedly, new ordeals
will await us.

Thank heavens you're safe!

Why does war never
disappear from this world?
To me, it is clear that
it is meaningless...
Perhaps it is our fate
to be forever at discord
with each other?

We look forward to the
dawn of the true world!

Recognition of the existence
of Solaris may present a new
way of looking at the Nisan
orthodoxy.
In that sense, I believe
we have finally reached a
new starting point.

After seeing everyone in
high spirits, a new sense
of hope rose within me!

The road we must take
is out there somewhere.
A way out of the confusion
we are now facing...
The sister sitting diagonally
across from me, is desperately
looking for that answer.

I thought it appropriate for
you and your deeds to be
told to future generations.
So I have discussed this with
Sister Agnes and we concluded
that your many travels and
experiences be recorded by me.
Therefore,
please come back alive!
Your accomplishments will be
passed on from generation to
generation!

(... Somewhere...
It must be somewhere...
The truth that we have
not yet come to know.)

Oh!? That scared me.

Fei
"You're very devoted."

Uh, well sort of...
It's just that after
sneaking into the capital,
I started to think about
a lot of things...
And I've come to realize
the world isn't right
the way it is now!

Yes,  the world isn't right
the way it is now!

Yes,  the world isn't right
the way it is now!

The others left in order
to go help the evacuating
citizens.
I remained to help Sister
Agnes look after herself
and the things here.

Voluntarily declaring
republicanism yourself
is amazing.
It would be great if
Bartholomew became
president.
But, it would not be much of
a change from the way things
are now, though would it?
In any case, I think
Master Bartholomew would
be just fine.

Agnes
"The one pictured in the
portrait in the painting
room is Sophia.
She is the first great
mother of Nisan.
According to legend, the
portrait was painted
about 500 years ago.

Agnes
"I understand you were
shown Sophia's portrait.
The lady portrayed in
that picture is Nisan's
great founding mother...
Some say that it was
painted at least 500
years ago.

Citan
"500 years ago...
Now that is quite amazing.
Personally, I find it
intriguing. Do you have
any historical material
from that period?

Agnes
"In our hands, there are no
such records left intact.
All records and materials
concerning Sophia have
been lost...
The portrait is the only
thing left.
We too do not have much
knowledge about her."

Citan
"That is too bad!
So there really is
nothing left at all!?"

Agnes
"For someone who has helped
Marguerite, I would have
loved to have shared them...
But unfortunately I am
unable to help here..."

Citan
"Oh well, none the matter.
Please do not worry about
it. I was just inquiring."

Citan
"But, it does seem
somewhat strange...
If such a majestic building
as this survived history,
then it is likely a scroll
or two would remain too."

Agnes
"According to tradition,
Sophia was present about
500 years ago...
She sacrificed herself for
the people and has been
summoned to be with god.
That's all I can tell you."

Citan
"...I see.
So everything was lost in
the darkness of history."

Agnes
"I was speaking earlier
with Marguerite, and she
led me to believe that
you are heading to Aveh."

Bart
"Yeah. We might cause a
little trouble for the
folks of Nisan...
But it's something that
I simply cannot avoid."

Agnes
"Yes, I understand.
Just that, if you allow me
to say my true feelings...
I wish that you could find
a way to bring peace to this
country without bloodshed...
But I will not try to stop
you now, Master Bartholomew.
You must have put in much
thought before making this
decision.
We of Nisan, will be with
you, Master Bartholomew."

Bart
"Thanks Sister."

Fei
"Yes."

Agnes
"Where is Master
Bartholomew?"

Fei
"He's in town talking
with Margie."

Agnes
"I see my child.
Then please tell him this...
 'We will always be with
 you, Master Bartholomew.' "

Fei
"I'll be sure to relay
that to him, Sister."

Agnes
"The one pictured in the
portrait in the painting
room is Sophia.
She is the first great
mother of Nisan.
According to legend, the
portrait was painted
about 500 years ago.

Agnes
"I understand you were
shown Sophia's portrait.
The lady portrayed in
that picture is Nisan's
great founding mother...
Some say that it was
painted at least 500
years ago.

Citan
"500 years ago...
Now that is quite amazing.

Agnes
"I shall pray that
your battles are safe
and successful."

Agnes
"Everyone is safe and well!
Oh... Thank heavens.
How is Marguerite?
We here are all doing well,
so please tell her that."

Agnes
"I hope nothing has
happend to the great
mother's remains...
If the mausoleum becomes
damaged in any way, I'll
have no right to live."

Bart
"Don't be so hard
on yourself.
You sisters have done your
best to protect the town,
right?
Just leave the rest to us."

Agnes
"Finally, we can create
the country the late king
and Great Mother desired.
I hope that I can be of
assistance to master
Bartholemew.
Before we do that though,
we'll have to determine the
the real relation between 
Bartholomew and Marguerite.
But come to think of it,
that is really up to 
them to work out..."

Agnes
"To pass on the deeds you
people have accomplished,
we have decided to record
your journey...
As the ones who, along with
the Great Mother Marguerite,
lead us to our true world...
You will live forever in
the hearts and minds of
the people that live on
this planet."

Citan
"Oh my...
What an exquisite portrait!
And the beautiful young
lady portrayed is quite
beyond comparison too..."

Citan
"What is more...
this looks rather
familiar...!"

Citan
"What do you think, Fei?"

Fei
"Yes, I was just thinking
the same thing.
The hair is a different
color, but the atmosphere
or personality about her
is exactly the same."

Citan
"What? 
Hair color?
What do you mean?"

Fei
"What do I mean?
Look...!
It's the girl I met
in the forest..."

Fei
"It's Elly! I mean...
there's something about her
that's just like Elly..."

Fei
"You don't think so...?"

Citan
"Yes, now that you mention
it...
She does resemble Elly."

Citan
"But that is not what I
was talking about...
I meant that the brush
techniques and overall
style used in this picture
is similar to yours."

Fei
"...Really?"

Fei
"Does it...?"

Fei
"First of all...
I'm nowhere near
as good an artist."

Citan
"No...it is very similar
to your style."

Citan
"But somehow I can sense
an atmosphere of sadness
in this picture."

Citan
"She is smiling, but in a
way, gives the impression
that she is anxious."

Citan
"Perhaps the picture is
reflecting her inner self?"

Citan
"Or perhaps it is the
inner feelings of the
artist being conveyed."

Citan
"Ahh...
If you look closely,
you will notice that
the painting is not
completely finished."

"The artist put his
brushes down when it
was near completion."

Citan
"...Why is that?"

Margie
"I don't know...
But my grandmother
might have known
about it..."

Margie
"Oh! What if we ask Agnes?
She may know something."

Margie
"Alright then, I'll
be with Sister Agnes."

Bart
"Well...shall we head
back to the town for
now?"

Citan
"Yes, alright...
But this painting has
caught my curiosity.
Do you mind if I speak
to Sister Agnes before
we head back to town?"

Bart
"Yeah, okay...
We'll stop by her
room on the way out."

        Lacan...

Citan
"Is something wrong, Fei?
You look like you are
daydreaming..."

Fei
"Huh?
No...
It's nothing..."

Bart
"There isn't time 
for this!" 

Bart
"This isn't the entrance
to the underground 
waterway!"

Bart
"Hey, that's pretty
good, grandpa!"

The hotel I am
talking about is...

Hey, you!

Do they really need 
that much for the war?

I'm sorry. The army just
comes and confiscates
whatever it wants. So I'm
a little short of stock.

Oh no, you raised
the prices again...

Hey, give me a deal.

I hope this war
ends soon.

Whew, keeping up with my
granddaughter is tough.

Sho~ppi~ng
Sho~ppi~ng
Shopping is great...

Grandma, hurry, hurry!
Finish shopping so we
can go to the festival.

It's almost time for 
the festival. I wonder 
if it'll be crowded?

Are you all here for the Tournament?
    Yes
    Huh?

Yeah, well I'm glad. The
war's gotten worse, and
there are fewer tourists.
Well, have fun.

What, you don't know?
It's only the biggest
martial arts tournament
in the world!
I came all the way to
Bledavik just to see it.
You'll be sorry if you
don't go.

Argh, I'm so busy! The
shop owner was drafted
and now I have to do
everything myself, from
taking care of the kids
to running the shop.

Life's been hard since
the old king died.
Not that an old man like
me has much longer to
worry about that...
But my children and grand-
children are still young.
I wonder if it'll ever get
any better?

Huh!?

Hmm, 
Who was that?
I forgot...

Oh yeah!
I remember! 

Prince Bartholomew?
    Yes!
    Don't know him!

Hmm...
must be someone else...
When you get older your
memory really goes.

My, how you've grown...
Your Highness probably 
doesn't remember me, but
I used to work in the
castle kitchen.
You would always come
in and taste everything.
You used to dress up and
say, 'I'm a pirate! Give
me your food!'...
Ah, the good old days...

Welcome to Bledavik!
We don't get many visitors
these days. You're the
first in quite a while!

Welcome to Bledavik!
We're having a festival
celebrating the founding
of our country, Aveh.
There's a martial arts
tournament too.
It's been a while since
we have had so many
visitors.

Do you already have a hotel?
    Yes
    Not yet

Really? Too bad. 
I know a good place.

You'd better get a room
soon or they'll all be 
gone.
I know a good hotel.

That one.

Tell them my name at
the front desk and
they'll give you a deal.

There's been a lot of
shoplifters lately. It's
all because of this war.
Everything's in such 
short supply.

Welcome!
Are you going to
the festival plaza?
    Yes
    No

Just between you n' me...
Aveh's 500th anniversary
festival isn't all that
great. It's because the
war's getting worse...

After coming all this way
I gotta see the Tournament.
Guys love fights. Why
aren't you in it?

I know some stuff is
missing...but that kid
didn't have anything.
I guess I was mistaken.

Show me what you're 
hiding! 
Give it back now and I 
won't tell your folks.

That's strange...

I promise I'll return it
when my dad comes back.

Get off my back!
I'm just looking!

Shut up! 
Mind your own business!

!

(Hurry!) 

What are you talking
about lady? I'm not
hiding anything! Do you
wanna see?

See. 

You can't accuse people
without proof!
C'mon lady!

!!

Thanks for loaning me 
money. I'll stop stealing. 
The two of us will work
hard till dad comes back.

Whaddya want? 
You're buggin' me, 
get outta here!

Hey! Hey, man!
Will you feed us?
    Sure
    Well...

Then lend me 1000G
    Sure
    No way

!! 

Wow, thanks...
You're really
nice man...
I mean 'mister'.

Hey, if you don't have 
any money don't fool 
people like that.

I thought so.

Just as I thought,
adults are all talk.

(Here...) 

(Yeah!) 

You're not from
around here are you?
Well, I hope you
enjoy our town fair.

Any monster fangs? 
Any monster eyeballs? 
Any monster scales?
We'll buy 'em all for 
a good price. 

What do you wanna sell?
    Fang     150G
    Eyeball  300G
    Scale    600G
    No way

I'll give you a better
price than anyone.

Thanks, come again.

You don't have any!

Alright, got it!

Received G.

Radishes! Get 'em here!
Get your spicy radishes!
Big Lahan radishes! 

Wanna buy a radish?
They're from Lahan, the
hottest you can find.
You'll be spitting fire.
Try one.

10G for one.
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Alright.
How about 9G?
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Just try one.
8G?
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Hey, you can't carry anymore!
Don't play tricks on old
people like that.

Thanks.

Hey!
Don't burn yourself 
breathing fire.

Weren't you going to
buy one? They say people
who play tricks on the
old will shrivel up and
die in the desert.

You don't like spicy
things?
Too bad.

Bananas! Bananas! 
Long bananas! 
Good for body and soul! 
Buy some bananas! 

Did you bring money?
    Yes
    No 

Bring some money. 

Buy a banana?
The monsters of the 
western forest love them.
They're called Elfananas.
You can't find better
bananas than these.

You seem like a nice guy,
so only 10G for a bunch!
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

They're delicious!
How about 9G?
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

OK, a special!
2 bunches, 16G.
How about it handsome?
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

Hey, you have too much 
stuff. Come back again.

Thanks!
You're a nice guy.

Wow!
Thanks!
Come again.

What, forgot your wallet?
Too bad, but I can't give
it to you. Bring your 
wallet next time.

Well...
If you don't eat bananas 
you won't become a strong 
soldier.

Young sir! Young sir!
Berries, buy some berries.
Sweet, delicious berries...
they're 'berry' cheap.

Go away!

Delicious berries.
You can't find Ariberries
like these anywhere else.
Deep red berries grown
with Aveh spring water.

One box 10G.
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

Alright,
I can go 9G.
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

Ok then, 8G
I can't go any lower.
    Buy some
    Don't buy any 

Hey, you've got too 
much stuff. Come again.

Thanks!

Hey!
They're really good.
Just try some.

WHA? No money!?
Gimme a break! Get out!

Too bad, they're really 
good. Maybe next time.

Cap'n suspicious people!wned(30)

Cr'ap'n susp'cious peepl!wned(30)

We are the Raider Boys!
Joined together to
protect Aveh's peace!

We protect the people
of the desert from the
steam heads of Kislev.

Shut up! 
I'm the captain and I'm
talkin' here!

Right, starting 
tomorrow we'll switch 
off. 
That's good!

Let's return to 
patrol!
Forward  march!

Kislev steam heads!
We'll kick their...

They're kettle-heads
with steam for brains!

Twist their noses
till they come off!

We are the Raider Boys!
We're protectin' the peace
in this part of the desert!

Yeah!

You're not from Aveh!

Company  halt!

Shut up!

Yeah!

You're Kislev people!

Don't be bossy!
It's not fair!
You're always Cap'n.

I was first!
Tomorrow I'm the Cap'n!

Hey!

You are an Abeh from Kisreb.

Yeah, yeah 
I wanna be Cap'n too!

Me too 
I'm Cap'n tomorrow.

Come here.

My brother has gone
off to fight...

To the north, by the
border.
I pray everyday that
he will return home 
safe...

...And that he'll beat up
lots of Kislev guys too!

When I get older I wanna
be a Gear pilot and shoot
Kislev guys too.
If we don't they'll take
over and kill or make
slaves of everyone.

Right
    Yep
    Not really

I'm gonna be a 
strong soldier!

Those Kislev guys 
are real bad!
And...they killed
my dad.
I hafta get 'em.

Hurry up, use it!
We're not just playing 
around here.

If you use this box you
can climb up fast.
Use it?
    Use it
    Don't need it

It'll be 5G.

What, you're poor too?
Well, I'll just tell you.
If you move back and jump
you don't need the box.

O-kay.

He said he doesn't play
hide-and-seek anymore.
Isn't there anything fun
to do?

I wonder...
where's he hiding?

Can you help me too?
    Okay
    I'm busy

Thanks
The rule is you can't 
hide in houses or where 
you can't see.

We're busy too!

I don't play hide-and-
seek anymore and you
shouldn't at your age
either!

When you leave I'll 
hide somewhere.

Ah, you found me.

We're playing hide-and-
seek. You wanna play?
    Play
    No thanks

When you leave I'll
hide, then you gotta 
find me.

Afraid you'll lose, heh?

Good job.
Next time I'll hide 
somewhere better.

You found me here too.
Next time's for real.

I didn't think you'd ever
find me here. You're good.
You musta been the champ
when you were a kid.
But you won't find me
next time.

A~w-ge~e!
You found me here, too?
OK, time for my secret
weapon! You'll never
find me there!!

GE~EZ!
How'd you find me?
Forget it!
I'm quitting
hide-and-seek.
Here's my badge.
I don't need it
anymore.

 Received H&S Badge

Huh? You wanna hear about
when I went down the well?
It's been a while since
anyone asked me about that.
Everyone wanted to know
about it back then...
Well...cough...I was
still a kid when I hid
in there. Actually I got
lost...pretty embarrassing!
At first, I thought I could
follow the current out, but
the grill stopped me.
So I swam against the
current.
The speed of the current
is always changing so if
your timing's off it's
really tough.
I hear it's the opening
and closing of the flood
gate that changes the
speed of the current.
But if you keep going
against the current you'll
end up right under the
castle.
I was scared stiff by the
manager guy there...
The lid to the well's
been locked since then.
It was a great place to
hide but it's no place
for amateurs.

Huh? The key?
The old guy who is always
sitting on the bench by
the east well has it.

The well key?
I've got it.
I'm in charge of the
waterworks association.

What are you gonna do with the key?
    Search underground
    Rescue Margie
    Steal from the castle

Stupid!
You'll just get lost!

What!?
You wanna clash
with Shakhan?

Hah!
This is great!
This is great!
I like you guys.
I'll lend you the key.
You get that Shakhan
for me!

Received Well Key!

You big fools!!
You kids are thinking of
playing around and living the
easy life while other kids are
out there spilling their blood
on the battlefield!
Shame on you! Shame!
You don't deserve to live here.
This whole town is rotting
away...
Damn! Damn that Shakhan!

Bart
"Don't get mad, gramps.
It's a joke. A joke.
Look at me. Do I look
like a thief to you?"

I don't get it ...
...............
Oh?...Oh!...You...
No, it couldn't be!

Bart
"Gramps, are you senile?
It's true. It is me!"

Prince Bartholomew?
I though you had died in 
that accident. 
You're still alive...

Bart
"Still alive and I'm gonna
save my cousin being held
in the castle.
That's why I gotta sneak
in through waterways. So
help me out here gramps."

Of course!

Received Well Key!

Bart
"Thanks.
I appreciate it!"

Sorry about what I 
said before...

Bart
"Don't worry about it.
I'm glad there are people 
like you worried about 
the country."

If Prince Bartholomew
comes back he'll bring 
back Aveh's old spirit.

Go get'em, boy!

It's cool here. 
Cool air blows up 
from the grate.

Yeah!
He's great guy!
My childhood friend.

No good, no good.
You won't open it 
without the key!
Many years ago a kid 
got lost down there.
I think it was the kid 
from the armor store...

I've been doing laundry
here for 60 years...
The water is the only
thing that hasn't changed.
There's a spring flowing
beneath the castle.
I was worried that when
the king died, the water
would stop too, but it 
didn't.
That old guy down there
in charge of the water
won't budge an inch even
for Shakhan.

Citan
"The young one will sneak
into the castle through
the underground waterways.
Once we are all ready, he
can enter either the well
here or the one on the
other side of town!"

It's locked.

Of course, business is
better when there's peace.

You said it. 
The army returned all the
stuff they confiscated.

Look, prices went down.

Really? 
Then, can't you give
it to me cheaper?

My son's coming back and
our grandchild's excited. 
She's so hyper, it's hard
for me to keep up!

Even with my son back,
taking care of the kids
is the old folks job.

Grandpa, hurry, hurry!
We gotta buy the stuff
for the welcome party
before dad gets back.

Grandma, hurry, hurry!
Let's finish shopping and
go to the festival!

Prince Bartholomew,
thank you very much
for ending the war.
My son should be
back any day now.

Are you here for the Tournament?
    Yes
    What's that?

Too bad, it's already
over.

Ah, it's better if you
don't know. Just enjoy
Bledavik in peacetime.

Wow, am I busy! Ever
since I got back, my
wife's been telling me
the housework's backed up
and won't help with the
business at all!

Prince Bartholomew.
I've been awaiting your
return.
May you have a peaceful
rule in Aveh.

Now I'm not so worried
about my kids and
grandkids. I can relax 
in peace.

Now that the war is 
over there should be 
lots of visitors. 
I gotta be ready.

It's great that Prince 
Bartholomew returned, but 
what's this Republic 
thing?

Peace at last! Now we
can live without fear.

Meat, meat, mee~at!
Get ya meat, me~eat!
Hey buddy, you gotta
eat lotsa me~at!

Hey buddy, want some meat?

You don't have enough money!

If you don't eat meat
you'll get sick...

Thanks for lending me 
that money before.
My dad never came back
but I still don't steal.
The two of us are working
hard. We opened up our
own business.
So now I can give you
back your money.
A little at a time.

Even without dad, 
we'll make it.

Here's the first part.
And I'll work real hard
to pay back the rest.

Sorry, I haven't 
saved any money to 
give back yet.

I'll be here working hard,
so stop by sometime and 
buy some meat.

You got 100G back.

Any monster fangs? 
Any monster eyeballs? 
Any monster scales? 
I pay the most!

What do you wanna sell?
    Fang    150G
    Eyeball 300G
    Scale   600G
    No way

If you get any sell them
to me, I'll beat anyone's
price.

Come back again.

You don't have a thing!

Alright, got it!

Received G.

Fruit that's kinda spicy
Fruit that's kinda large
Kinda hard to say
Why it's so bizarre
Get your Bizfruit now

I used to sell Lahan
radishes my mom grew.
But when I got out of the
army, Lahan was gone.
So now I sell Bizfruit.

Hey, you can't
carry any more.

Thanks.

Come again!

Won't you buy just one? 
Mess with a veteran, and
you might step on a mine.

You hate bizarre things?
...Too bad.

Bananas Bananas big
Long bananas! 
Good for body and soul!
Buy some bananas today!

Did you bring money?
    Yes
    No 

Bring some money.

forest love them!
They're called Elfananas.
Can't find better bananas
than these!

stuff. Come back again.

Thanks!
You're a good man.

Wow!
Thanks!
Come again.

Forgot your wallet?
Sorry, but I can't give 
'em to you. Bring your 
wallet next time.

Well...
Eat your bananas and
you'll grow up to be a
strong soldier.

Hey! Try these berries!
Sweet, delicious...
I'll make you a deal! 

Go away!

Delicious berries.

water, deep red berries.

!? No money?
Stupid! Get outta here!

Too bad, there really 
good. Maybe next time.

Back home at last.
I like helping my wife out
at home much better than
giving orders on the 
battlefield.

Shakhan
"Hah ha ha ha,
Bartholomew the pirate.
I've got Margie.
If you don't like it,
come and get her."

Margie
"...Help me
Bartholomew!"

Bartholomew
"You coward! Stealing 
Aveh wasn't enough 
for you, Margie too?

Shakhan
"What's that, pirate!? 
I made this country what
it is.
You just wandered around
the desert! You louse!"

Bartholomew
"What the...?
You bald geez!
Take this!
Pirate kick!"

Shakhan
"Whoa, you got me.
You brat."

Shakhan
"Ramsus!"

Ramsus
"Ramsus is here!
Fight me Bartholomew!"

Bartholomew
"Whoa, this guy is strong.
This is gonna be tough!"

Bartholomew
"Now it's two on two! 
Let's go!"

Shakhan
"Hmph, infidels!
I'll kill you yet!"

You're no fun!

Playing Margie 
is no fun!

Well? You lost at
paper, rock, scissors.

No! I wanna 
play the good part.

Stop complaining.
I don't wanna play the 
bald coot's part.

Let's play something 
else.

Yeah, okay.

Well, that's it 
for today.

Adults do whatever
they want. First they
said take out Kislev,
now they say let's be
friends.

Prince Bartholomew
is so cool.
Big and strong.

Adults do whatever 
they want. First they 
said take out Kislev,
now they say let's be 
friends.

The Raider Boys broke up.
Kislev's not the enemy
anymore, now there's 
nothing to do.

My mom told me to grow
up to be a great man like
Prince Bartholomew.

The Raider Boys broke up.
Kislev's not the enemy
anymore, now there's 
nothing to do.

I'm busy, so bug off!

We protected the
desert's peace.

I wanna grow up now. 
I hate playin' dumb roles.

We protected the 
desert's peace.

That's it for
hide-and-seek...
I'll have to think of
something else to play.

I wonder...
where's he hiding?

Can you help me too?
    Okay
    I'm busy

Thanks
The rule is you can't 
hide in houses or where 
you can't see.

We're busy too!

I don't play hide and 
seek anymore. You 
shouldn't play either!

When you leave I'll 
hide somewhere.

Ah, you found me.

I'm playing hide-and-seek.
You wanna play too?
    Play
    No thanks

When you leave I'll 
hide, then you gotta 
find me.

Sigh, I have no 
confidence.

Good job. 
Next time I'll hide 
somewhere harder.

You found me here too. 
Next time is for real.

I didn't think you'd 
find me here. You're 
good. You musta been the
champ when you were a kid.
But, next time you
won't find me.

Crap! You found me here?
Now for my secret weapon. 
You'll never find me there!

Again!
How'd you find me?
I quit hide and seek.
Here's my badge.
I don't need it anymore.

Awesome.

Thanks.
This is great.

I'm gonna be 
strong too.

It's cool here. 
Cool air blows up 
from the grate.

I got back from the
army and then my mom
collapsed in illness.
She was so glad that I
came back safe.
But why does a guy like
me have to do laundry?
I need to find a wife,
and fast.

Citan
"Let us borrow a
room here for our
planning session."

!

Ah...
Excuse me but...aren't 
you Prince Bartholomew?

Bart
"...And you are?"

I was sent here by
the Nisan Sect.  
I'm here to check up
on Mother Marguerite.
Prince Bartholomew,
I knew you would come
sooner or later...

Citan
"Well, let us not just
stand here chatting. 
Shall we use a room?"

You must be tired. 
I'll be in my room, 
please come by later.

That's my room there.

Yeah, after bein' in the
army for so long even
after I got out I just
didn't feel like working.
But watching mom work
like this, it makes me
think I might want to
again.

Citan
"Let us hurry to
the meeting place."

I'm sorry, we're full today.
If you can wait till evening
I'll have something then...

Welcome.

I'll mark it down to
40G per person.
    Thanks
    No way

How about 50G a person?
    Okay
    No way
    I have a recommendation

How about 50G per person?
    Okay
    No way

Whose sent you?
    Ari
    Shiffer
    I don't know

Aw, she never gives her name. But...
okay, I'll mark it down to 40G each.
    Thanks
    No way

I don't know her! 
50G per person.
    Okay
    No way

That's  people, 
it'll be G.

You don't have 
enough money.

Come again!

Hey, don't pull my leg.

It's old and nearly broken,
so stop messin' with it!

See? You broke it! Now
you have to pay for it!

That'll be 100G.

What, you 
don't even have 100G?

    OFF
    LOW
    MID
    HI

It's locked.

Citan
"Let us go hear what
the sister has to say."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik - Hotel Room - 0816
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Good work. Get plenty
of rest for tomorrow."

Going out again?
    Yes
    Get some rest

Citan
"Are you sure?
Please do not come 
back too late."

Citan
"Good.
Save your energy
for tomorrow."

Citan
"Come back after you
have registered for
the Tournament."

Citan
"Good morning.
Operation 'Rescue Margie'
is now underway!"

Citan
"First Fei and I will
prepare for the Tournament
at the arena.
When the Tournament starts,
Bart will enter the water-
way through the well and
head for the castle.
If you swim against the
current you should reach
the castle.
I am certain there will
still be some guards
there, so please dispose
of them quietly.
We will make a good show
at the Tournament to draw
the guards' attention as
long as possible.
During that time, you can
rescue Margie."

Any questions?
    Got it
    Once more, please

Citan
"Then let us go.
Be careful, young one!"

Bart
"Fei, no matter what, 
you gotta win!"

Bart
"Well, I'm all ready so
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Man, I'm beat."

More sightseeing 
in Aveh?
    Yes
    Rest

Bart
"Really?
If we succeed tomorrow
I won't be  comin' back
here for a while."

Bart
"Yeah, tomorrow will be 
tough for both of us."

Bart
"Did you register for
the Tournament? What?
Not yet! Go hurry and
sign up."

Bart
"It's about to start!
I guess I better go
get ready too."

Is this plan really
going to work?

Bart
"It's already started. 
If something's wrong now,
then that's tough!
What're you worried about?
Fei'll do okay.
Besides Citan's with him,
too.
Now, all I gotta do is
sneak into the castle
through the well.
No problem."

I pray so.

Bart
"Well, I'm going.
Margie's waiting
in the citadel."

Well then...
do be careful.
And thank you for
helping Mother
Marguerite.

Bart
"No sweat!
You'd better get
outta Aveh now too.
Things are gonna get
outta hand soon."

Thank you.

!!

What's going on!?
How dare you come into
other people's rooms
through the window...

Prince Bartholomew!

...I'm sorry. I heard
Prince Bartholomew was
coming here...
I just never expected
it would be through
the window...

Please come in.

Excuse me but
who are they...

Bart
"Oh, this is Fei and
Citan. They're going to
help rescue Margie."

Thank you for coming here
in this desert heat.
I am a servant of the
Nisan Sect.
Ever since Shakhan took
Mother Marguerite I've
been looking into ways
to get her back.
I've been trying to find
out where she is being
held.
I've been busy listening
to workers talk about
the comings and goings
from the castle...
And giving food to the
guards who are preparing
for the Tournament to
loosen their lips too.
Finally yesterday, I got
some information...
Margie's in the citadel.
The problem is how to 
slip into the castle...
I thought about it a lot
but it looks pretty bleak.
I'm sorry.

Bart
"No big deal. At least
we know where she is now.
You just relax, we'll
find a way to slip into
the castle."

My apologies. If there
is anything else I can do
to help just ask...
Do you have any good leads?

Did you find a way 
into the castle?

Did you find a way 
to use the festival?

Any new information?
Good ideas?

Any luck finding
the well key?

Bart
"Yeah, the old guy next 
to the well had it."

Citan
"Not yet. We are going
to look for it again."

Bart
"Not yet. We're gonna
hit the streets for
info. now.
Then we'll think
about the rest later."

I see. I'm very relieved
that you are all here.
Please come see me again
if you hear anything new.

Bart
"I just remembered where
Bledavik's water supply
comes from...
Spring water rises up from
under the castle and flows
to the town via a series
of underground waterways.
We can sneak into the
castle by going through
these underground
waterways.
We can get into them from
the town's well. The water-
ways should lead right up
to the castle's reservoir.
If we are able to get that
far, we should be able to
sneak into the other rooms
of the castle from there."

Citan
"A good idea, except I
have one more suggestion.
There is a festival going
on now. There must be a
way we can use it to our
advantage." 

!

North of town is a
plaza. The castle is
beyond that.
I'm sure we'll find
something there.

Citan
"Tomorrow is the 
Tournament. There will
be betting at the arena.
Surely, the soldiers'
minds will be more on the
Tournament than their job.
We must use this to our
advantage."

What do you mean?

Citan
"Fei will participate.
We will have him put
on a big show there."

Bart
"Tomorrow's the Tournament.
Nothing's more popular than
gambling at these things.
All the guards will be
betting. They'll all be
gambling.
They'll be more interested
in the fight than their
jobs. We gotta use this.
Fei! You've gotta fight!"

Fei
"Huh? Me?"

Bart
"Everyone would know me.
Besides, I know the castle
well so I should sneak in."

I'm sure today's the
last day to sign up for
the Tournament. You'd
better register soon.

Citan
"No need to worry.
Fei already registered."

Citan
"Even if using that as a
ploy, how will you really
get into the castle?"

Bart
"...We gotta get more
info. I'm sure we'll get a
good idea from somewhere."

Citan
"Very well.
If we get any good ideas
we will meet back here and
plan our strategy."

Citan
"Tomorrow Fei will be in
the Tournament at Fatima
castle.
We will put on a good show
to distract the guards.
Then Bart will infiltrate
the castle through the
underground waterways
by way of the well.
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

Citan
"Sounds good.
Fei is in the Tournament.
He will draw the guards'
attention.
Then Bart will enter the
castle through the
waterways via the well.
After that he will rescue
Marguerite from the
citadel.
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will 
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

Citan
"...There is one problem.
The well is locked. First
we must find the key."

Bart
"Let's go find the key, 
and fast!"

Citan
"Preparations for our
plan are complete.
Tonight we will stay in
the hotel and start out
tomorrow.
We are free to do what we
like for now. 
Let us have a look around
the town."

Citan
"Now to register for
the Tournament.
Fei, pretend you are
looking around and
head for the castle."

Sorry I can't help you.

Please take care. 
I wish you the best 
of luck.

Please take care.
I will pray for
all of you to
return safely.

!

Wh, who are you!?
Just barging into a
lady's room.
And from the window!
Oh, I think I'm going to
faint. How rude you are!
What a dangerous town.
Get out, now!

What are you doing? 
Get out of here, now! 

No, don't come any 
closer! Get out, now!

0822 - Bledavik - Tournament Tiny Room
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I came from far away when
I heard about this festival.
But this town is so uptight!
Everyone looks at outsiders
like me so suspiciously!
It was getting to me, so I
shut myself up in my hotel
room.
But, now this tiny room is 
starting to get to me too.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0824 - Bledavik?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the war started
you can really tell who
is stupid and isn't.
The stupid ones have
been forced out of
business.
But if you change your
view, war can be good
business.
When there aren't enough
people or goods, you can
sell at a higher price.

A republic...
I could support that.
No wait, I'd rather
be a candidate.
Prime Minister of the
Republic of Aveh...
What a great job!
And I wouldn't have
to pay taxes either!

...That makes 5 mining 
Gears and 10 miners.

And make it quick!
I need some miners
without families.

Well... When guys with
families get killed on
a dangerous job, I have
to pay compensation to
the families.
It's a real pain.

So that's it. 
If you find some tell me.
I'm counting on you.

What's with you all?
Outta my way!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik??? - 0826
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When will I ever
be able to leave
this dump!

Prince Bartholomew, be
careful of my father.

Even though the war's
over, that old coot
is still thinking up
all kinds of dirty
business...

Hey, my sister is
getting married
to someone named
Vanderkaum.

Hey, my sister is
getting married
to someone named
Bartholomew.

Stupid! 
Why would I do that?
With that old creep?
I'd never be used as
a tool for that old
fart's business.

Ahh...
I don't have anything
against you personally...
I just hate doing
what father says.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik Home - 0828
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since my oldest son
was drafted, I've been
so lonely.
My younger son is up on
the roof looking north.
Ahh... I hope my boy
comes home safely...
He's such a gentle child,
I'm worried how he'll
make it in the army.
He used to arrange the
flower upstairs.
But now I make them as
I pray for his safety.

My oldest son came back!
My prayers were answered.
Now I'm putting all my
effort into cooking.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik Restaurant - 0830
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is that waitress stupid? 
She said she has to go 
to block off the exit...

My big brother worked in
that restaurant.
He caught so many bilkers
who try to dine and dash.
He said he could tell who
would do that kinda thing.
Since he went into the army
there's a new waitress...
I want to make it easy for
him to get his job back
when he returns.
I mainly bug the waitress
and help the bilkers who
dine and dash get away.

My big brother came back
but he's not working at
the restaurant.
I'm doing my best to get
him a job soon. He says
he's gonna be a gardener.

Yep, home is best.
No enemy bullets or
sergeant's fists. And
best of all is my family.
The army taught me that
you have to do what you
want while you can.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik - Random House? - 0832
----------------------------------------------------------------------

My brother is such a 
child, always playing
hide-and-seek.
What a laugh. I wonder 
where he's hiding now?

My brother says he's
over playing hide-and-
seek. But now he has
nothing to do.
He's probably just
wandering around the
area. He's still such
a child.

That kid is amazing. 
Since her father has 
been away she's been 
running the store all
by herself.

My dad came back. 
I was helping him in the
store but he told me to
go play somewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik Armor Shop - 0834
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the armor shop.
What can I do for you?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0836
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, he's gone a little
senile... You see, our son
'went on holidays' to get
out of joining the army.
But we haven't heard from
him in 10 years...

Things have picked up
around here all of a
sudden. I feel young
again.

...The neighbor's kids
all came back. 
But not my son...

!

See, my son came back,
just like I said.

My son's fighting for
the country. He won't be
back soon...
It must be a tough job.
Yep, I'll bet he's a
general by now.

!

...hmph...
I thought my son came
back.

You...

!

While I was gone mom 
and pop got old...
They have to take it 
easy now.

I'm back.

Pop, I'm back.

Ohh...
You're back. 
Welcome home.

Mom, I'm back.

Is it really you? 
You never wrote us.
What were you doing? 

Sorry...
I was in Kislev. 
I sent letters but...
I guess they never got 
here.

Oh, I see. 
It must have been rough.

There's someone I want
you two to meet.

This is my wife.

Nice to meet you. 
Father, mother.

My son...

And daughter.

Hello gran'ma and 
gran'pa.

Hello...

Oh...
Hello there.

Welcome back.
I'm so glad you made
it back.

Our house in Kislev
burned down so we thought
we'd live here.
I'm so glad the war
is over.

A new house...

It's a new house...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0838
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I must apologize.
There are so many cats
here it's hard to walk.
My daughter collects them.

Yep, we're full of cats.

Cats are so cute. When
I pet them, I get sleepy.

My father used to 
hate cats, but now he's 
outside feeding them.

I'm back.

Hi...
Hey, come here!

Wh, what? 
I'm not hiding anything.

Just come here...

I did...
can I go upstairs now?

!

That child...
what did she bring home now?

But...it's so sad. 
I have no father, but at
least I have a mother. This
kitty has neither parent...
I feel lonely cause my
dad's not here. But just
think how my poor little
kitty friend feels.
So...I told her that she'll
have lots of friends at my
house...and she just
followed me home...

... Recently they 
started calling my 
house the cathouse.

Sorry.

You're gonna have to 
take care of it.

Okay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0840
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I get back from guard duty
on the Kislev border and
find my house has turned
into a damned cathouse...
I guess my daughter was
a little bit lonely.
But I've gotten used to
having them around...
In fact, now I feel sad
if even one cat leaves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0842
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Get out. I don't serve
liquor to strangers!

Want something to eat?
Then go wait at those
tables up there.

You're strangers, huh?
    Yeah
    No

You aren't from Kislev.
    No we're not!
    Why, yes we are!

Yeah, I suppose...
You look the same as us.
There's a rumor going
around that spies are
here for the festival...

What? Then you're
really Kislev spies...?

...
There have been rumors 
of spies recently...
We were told to report
it if we see any.

Hey!
Who d'ya think made it
so ya can enjoy this
festival in peace?
Soldiers! It's 'cause
we're out there risking
our lives. Did ya know
that?

That fool...
Kicking the bucket
before ever seeing
the Tournament...

What! 
Kislev spy?
I'm gonna kill you!

I'm not losing to you!
Come on, Kislev spy!

We're fighting to the end.
This isn't for peace or
justice or for the government,
it's for my fallen comrades.

I'm sorry, all his 
friends were killed in
the battle at the ruins.
He's a little wild.
Forgive him.

Hey, c'mon you're drunk.
Are you okay? 
Let's go home.

!!

Fish are pretty. I
could watch them all day.
    You said it!
    I'd like to eat!

I thought I'd go to the
sea after the war. 
I don't mean the sea of
sand either.
Just water, spreading on
forever like a desert...
A sea of water full of
pretty fish.

Your order?
    Something delicious
    Something cheap
    Something fast

Just a moment

Enjoy. 

Thanks.

That'll be G.

Thank you, 
please come again.

Hey, you don't have 
enough money, do you?

HP/MP fully restored!
Gained a bit of weight!

HP/MP restored a bit!
Gained a lot of weight!

HP/MP partially restored!
Gained a bit of weight!

That was good.

Oh, sorry.
Table for how many?
This way please.

Oh god!
Dine and dash, again!

Even my good-for-
nothin' kid gives me
less to worry about than
this wacky world...

All the young men in
town have been drafted.
They wouldn't take me
because I'm an alcoholic. 

Follow me!

    Do nothing
    Return to waterway

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0844
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0846 - Weapons Shop
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the weapons shop.
I'm helping out while my
dad's away in the army.

Thanks, come again.

I'm back in business
because my daughter 
worked so hard.

I'm so lucky to have
such a great daughter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0848
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a counter,
ya know. Some people...

Next time use the 
counter to talk to me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0852 - Bar
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome!
What can I get you?
    Bartweiser
    Marguerita
    Nothing

That'll be 40G.

Downed a Bartweiser 
in a single gulp.

Gained a bit of weight.

Hang on!
You don't have
any money!?

That'll be 50G.

Drank a
Marguerita
in one gulp.

Gained a bit of weight.

What the--?
You don't have
any money?

I haven't been to town
in so long Sarge, I 
don't know what to do.

Yeah...
How about the festival?

The festival...?

The festival to celebrate
the truce with Kislev,
Prince Bartholomew's
return and founding of
the Republic.

Oh yeah.  
Let's go.  
We couldn't make it 
back for the last one.

OK, I'm all 
ready to go!

Yeah, I'm glad they had
this festival, aren't you
Sarge?

Stop calling me Sarge,
we're not in the army 
anymore.

Fish are so pretty. I
could watch them all day.
    You said it
    I'd like to eat 'em

The guy that used to
work here came back from
the army...
And said he would take
me to the sea.
He said the water goes
on forever just like 
the desert.
He also said we could see
lots of pretty fish.
I can't wait to go...

Your order?
    Something delicious
    Something cheap
    Something fast

Just a moment

Enjoy. 

Thanks.

That'll be G.

Thank you, 
please come again.

Hey, you don't have 
enough money, do you?

In the old days, I'd
run to the owner's place
and they'd all run out
on me.
Now it's different.
The guy that worked here
before told me,
just grab something
of theirs whenever that
happens.

..................

...Well, you don't have 
anything that's worth 
the piece of the meal.
Just bring some money 
the next time.

This is nice. 

was taken.

That's still not 
enough to cover the meal.

This will pay for 
the meal. 
Next time please 
bring enough money.

HP/MP fully restored!
Gained a bit of weight!

HP/MP restored a bit!
Gained a lot of weight!

HP/MP partially restored!
Gained a bit of weight!

That was good.

Oh, sorry. Table for
how many? This way please.

Boss! We've got bilkers
dining and dashing, again!

You know...
Since all the men came
back my son and I feel
so ashamed.
But compared to wives
whose sons and husbands
died or came back wounded,
we're pretty happy.

I've been thinking...
about quitting drinking.
The reason I became an 
alcoholic was to get out
of going to war.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0854
----------------------------------------------------------------------

My kid says he wants
to be a soldier when 
he gets older.

Too bad.
By the time your child
gets older the war will
already be over.

Yep, looks like my 
kid wants to be a soldier 
when he grows up.

Oh no.
He'll change his 
mind eventually.

Mom...
Mom...
Dad...
They aren't coming back.

Woof 

Will this war ever end?
    It will
    No, it won't

Of course. 
All wars must 
end sometime.

Oh...
He's not coming back.

Will my happiness ever end?
    It will
    No, it won't

No, I won't let it.

Oh...
When you say that 
I get nervous.

Finally I'm back 
with my girl.

You say the dog talked?
    Yes
    No

Wow, that's amazing.

Ha ha ha
You got me.
Yep,
It was me talking.

The wind feels nice.

Why must people kill 
each other? Even dogs and
other animals don't do
that to each other.

Until recently I was
killing people on the
battlefield...
Is it right to have so
much peace?

I'm in training. You've
got to have a strong
body to beat Kislev.

Just when I get in
top shape, the war ends.
Look.

I trained so hard...

Watching kids playing
like this makes the the
battlefield seem like a
bad dream.

I'm taking care of my
mom and brother until
dad comes back!

Dad's back so now I can
relax and have a lot of
fun.

My dad's a...
loo-ten-ant.
He's really important.

Dad came back so 
now I can go play.

Just up ahead is the
castle. Usually you 
can't get in, but
festival time is special.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bledavik Festival - 0856
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm mmm mmm mmm 

Citan
"Fei, we can have
fun later."

Citan
"Fei, what shall we do?"
    Let the two of us go.
    Go to the castle later.

Bart
"Okay, be careful."

Bart
"Fei!"

Bart
"The castle's up ahead.
If I go, it'll cause 
problems.
If you're going to go,
the two of you should
go by yourselves.
I'll wait here."

Bart
"Well, let's go."

    Stay
    Go back underground

Don't talk to me!
I just choked!

Blue flames are 
flames of the heart.

Don't talk to me!
I just choked!

Red flames are 
flames of the body.

You want to try?
    Try it
    No thanks

Hold down the <X> button
while pushing the R2 
button.

Yes...

Hey, have you ever
seen a flying saucer?
    Yep
    Nope

Hey, have you ever
seen a flying saucer?
    Yes I have
    I've ridden on it too

...The gods fell from
the sky, lost their
memory and created
everything anew...

...People of that
country feared war on
earth and fled to the sky.

...Giants driven from
the heavens brought fire
on the earth...

Yes, that is the country of
the great ancients.
They came from a star farther
than heaven and created us.
They ruled this land as gods.
But, man gained knowledge and
strife erupted everywhere.
The ruins are proof of those
struggles. The descendants of
the gods fled this land of
conflict making their place
in the sky.
It was a peaceful place, with
a civilization far more
advanced than ours.
...Are you listening?
They are still alive.
Have you noticed that
sometimes people disappear?
They're taken by what I call
Sky People.
They are trained as soldiers
to rule over the earth again.
The time is near.
God's army will appear out of
nowhere. Haven't you heard?
Don't defy them, you can't
win.
They will make a paradise
on earth again. 
That's what my research
has shown about the Sky
People and the saucer.

...That's because you
live looking down.
...Pitiful.
The day of judgement
is near you know!?

!
...HUH!...
Hmph, you can't fool me.
Look people in the eye
and say what's on your
mind. I am a pro at that.

Inside the tent is a 
whole other world...
My heart is a balloon...
flying up into the sky...

What!?
How embarrassing.
A grown man walking
around with a balloon...

I'm going to see the
Tournament. Fighting
is a man's game.

Where's my dad? If he
doesn't get here soon
the festival will end.

That's a nice red
balloon you got there.

The guy in front of
that tent is giving 
out balloons.

I feel so happy.
I thought balloons were
lame but now that I got
one...

I've been playing
all day and didn't
even get yelled at.
That's because mom
is playing too.

It's great that dad came back,
but he's always telling me...
"Do your chores!
Do your homework!".
I have to play as much as I
can on festival days.

Hic!
Drinkin' Bartweiser
in broad daylight...
Thash my favorite
part of feshtivals!

...hic...
It's been a while since
I last drank outside.

You shouldn't
spoil kids.

Hey daddy, buy me
one of those toys.

No, nope.
Wait till the Tournament
is over. I'll buy you
something better then.

Hey, you're the one
who bought me the toy
earlier! Thanks.

The stuff they sell in
stores never changes.
When I grow up I wanna
have a toy store and
always make new toys.

Thanks for the toy.
I'll keep it always.

I want the toys in 
that store...
I wanna play army.

Wow!
That figurine you have...
...it's really neat.

Wow!
That gun you have...
...it's really neat.

I wanted that...
    Here, it's yours
    Yeah, well...

Really!

I'll have to wait 
until after the 
Tournament.
I hope my dad wins big.

Thanks mister.
I'll keep it forever.

That's it!
As thanks I'll tell
you a secret.
I heard this from my
grandpa...you know that
restaurant in town with
the fish tank?
And that treasure box in
the tank? 
Inside it...there's a
gold nugget! Good, huh?
Here's the best part...
There's a secret entrance
to it through the
underground waterways!
This is TOP secret, OK?
And you're the only one
I've told...
...really, thank you.

They're toys. They're fun.
Which do you want?
    Toy gun      80G
    Gear figure  120G
    No thanks

Not enough money.

Thanks.

Come again!

Hey bud! Care for a
'Bartweiser Lite'?
    Sure
    No thanks

It's 50G.

    Chugged a
'Bartweiser Lite'!

Wow! You're a 
good drinker!

Gained a little weight.

What? You don't
have any money!

If you don't want to die of
thirst then buy a drink!
    Durian Juice  10G
    Nisan Water   10G
    Aveh Water    10G
    No thanks

Not enough money, huh.

Hey, don't get crazy.

Come again!

Want some steamed cakes?
    Spiced cake  20G
    Iced cake    30G
    No thanks

That'll be 20G.

Fei
"Wow! That's h,h,hot!"

Gained a little weight.

That'll be 30G.

Fei
"Brrr, it's c,c,cold."

You hate steamed cakes...?

Not enough money.

Lost a little weight.

Ohmm, I'm a fortune 
teller.
My specialty is finding 
things.
I delve into your 
subconscious to search.
Ohmm, 1 try is 50G.

Ohmmm, let me delve?
    Delve away
    That's okay

Ohmm, I sense
you don't have any money.

Ohmm,  good bye.

I am back.

I have delved.

Ohmm...a small girl...
locked away...
...in a high tower 
to the north...

Ohmm,two points of
a triangle...
...a huge puzzle hidden
in the center...
one point is south 
by southwest...
one more is in the
south sea...

Hey!
Well if it isn't Fei!

!! 

It's me.
Moulten from the Laughing 
Pig Pub. You'd never
know it from the way I 
look now though...
Ha ha ha ha.
So how's my wife and 
daughter doing back in
the village?

...Ahh, ...um...

Of course, they're fine.
That's the only thing 
they do well.
Ha ha ha ha.
I want to return soon
but I still don't have
the money to bring them
to Aveh.
I'm done getting the
festival ready, and now
I've got another job.
I'm really busy.
It'd be nice to have a
little lodge in a small
village like Lahan.
To get the money together,
I started a business and
now I'm really busy.
I want to send my girl
to school and buy nice
things for my wife...
I guess I'm talking
too much.
Ha ha ha.

...If I don't go soon
the boss'll get mad. 
Well, see you Fei.
Say 'hi' to my wife
and daughter for me.

...

Hey, you're not from around here.
How do you like Bledavik?
    I like it
    Don't like it

Well, great.
Enjoy the festival.

Oh...
That's because the war's
put everyone on edge.
Bledavik's a really nice
place in peace time.

This festival is really
great. Peace is good.

Be careful. There are 
lots of strange shops at 
the festival.

Citan
"Well then, I will be over
here cheering for you.
Do not beat him too soon.
The better you do, the
easier it will be for
Bart to sneak in." 

Miang
"My...what a
handsome boy!"

Citan
"Good luck!"

!

Citan
"Fei, we can use this
to our advantage!
If you create a stir at
the Tournament, the guards
will be watching you
rather than their posts.
It will make it easy for
us to sneak into the
castle and rescue Margie.
What do you think, Fei?
Will you enter the 
Tournament?"

Fei
"Who...me?"

Citan
"While you draw the guards'
attention the young one can
sneak into the castle.
Surely you see that it is
the only way we will get
in? Right...
Let us go sign you up."

Citan
"And Fei, do not use
your real name, make
another suitable one."

...Brave young men are
spilling their blood on
the front lines. Our army
is the best, but the tides
of war are uncertain. 
To protect the tradition
of Aveh and preserve peace
in this desert, we must all
have unshaking resolve.  
The desert is a precious
treasure passed down to us
from our ancestors. Here we
can forge our minds and
bodies into one.
Our teachers are the sun 
and wind. 
We are gathered here today,
with our strong bodies
forged by the desert. 
The sun above us is the
same as that which burns
over our fathers at the
front. The wind blowing
here is the same as that
which whisks our resolve
and prayers to our sons at
the front.
This Tournament raises our
spirits and renews our
blessings from this desert
we live in.
Brave ones, warriors, fight
well and do not shame our
brothers at the front."

Let the 338th
Tournament begin!

Shakhan
"Hmm...a moving speech
if I do say so myself."

Shakhan
"Oh, Commander Ramsus. 
Sorry to have kept you
waiting. This way, please."

Ramsus
"I'm afraid I do not
have the time for such
gay revelry.
I just dropped by to
bid you farewell."

Shakhan
"What a pity. You do not
like our entertainment?"

Ramsus
"I find it boring."

Miang
"Oh, let it be Commander.
Shakhan is only trying to
show hospitality...
I personally find martial
arts quite interesting.
I look forward to seeing
the Tournament."

Shakhan
"To say this event is a 
tribute to you, Commander, 
is no understatement.
Your gracious help in our
time of need enabled us to
celebrate the country's
founding today."

Ramsus
"Founding, how impudent.
It's not even your 
country.
Hmph, do as you like."

Shakhan
"Miang, how about the
Tournament? Will you grace
us with your company?"

Miang
"Yes.
It would be
a pleasure."

Shakhan
"Oh, it's starting!"

Good luck tomorrow.

Hey, are you gonna fight?
Hmm 
...I'd say about 20 to 1.

Shoot, can't get any
decent customers today.

Yo, dude!
Try and pick the champion?

Citan
"The champion of what?"

Huh?
The champion of
the 'Tournament'!

Citan
"Do they bet on
this 'Tournament'?"

What
What are you talking about?
Tournaments ARE gambling!
Why do you think people
even come here? To bet on
who will be champion! Duh!

Citan
"Excuse us, we have only
just arrived and know
nothing of the Tournament."

Oh, tourists, huh?
Well let me tell you about
the Tournament.
Every year they hold a big
martial arts tournament 
here in Aveh.
Fighters from all over the
world gather to see who's
strongest. It's like a big
brawl.
Everyone goes wild over
guessing who'll win. So,
wanna give it a try?

Citan
"Betting on the Tournament
...Is that allowed at such
a grand event"

You bet. The soldiers
are crazy about it. If
Kislev attacked tomorrow
Aveh would be dust.
What are you gonna do?
Registration's not over
yet, but all the strong
ones have signed up.
The rest are only after
the consolation prizes
anyway...

Citan
"Let us wait and see.
Some strong ones might
still register."

Ha!
What a buncha cowards.

To enter...
Or not to enter...
That is the question...

To watch inside... 
Or watch outside...
That is the question...

Get ready!
It's starting soon!

Woo-hoo! This is gonna be
HOT! I love the sound of
folks smackin' each other!

I'm ready already...
What's taking so long?

We're almost ready!

If I was only 10 years
younger...cough...hack...
I'd whip 'em all...cough.

I was born and raised in
Dazil but this is my 
first Tournament.

This is the best place
to see the action for free.
I'm saving my space now!

Oh, hey! Those guys in
front are in the way! That
gets me sooo pissed!

I'm for the ones that
pay out big. Don't know
much about martial arts
though.
I sure could use a little
extra house money.

My son's in it! I hope
he doesn't get hurt. 
I'm so worried he's going
to get hurt.

My cousin's friend
is gonna fight in it.
Pretty cool, huh!

Hey, granpa...
Let's bet on someone too.

No, betting's for losers.
I brought you here because
I want you to grow up and
be a strong man.
Strong enough to fight 
in the Tournament someday.

Man, how lame.

I come every year. This
is my third time. I only
have to see 'em once to
know who's the strongest.
Are you fighting?
You look pretty strong.
Um, maybe a semi-finalist.
Good luck.

If my guy wins...
I'm going to the bar and
order the most expensive
whiskey they have.
Then I'm gonna ask that
waitress out! I wonder what
to get her for a present.

I'm betting on 
Big Joe too.

Trust me.
It's gonna be Big Joe.

I think Wiseman 
is stronger...

Who's sarge betting on?

Me I'm for Big Joe.

No way, bad choice.
He's all hot air.
Believe me, Wiseman's 
gonna win.

Shut up! I was right
last time, I'm not 
gonna listen to you.

Wow! You picked the champ
last time? You musta got
something like 50 to 1...

Yep and I blew it 
all in a week. 
Wah ha ha!

...What a waste.

Yep, that's the sarge. 
He's a man's man.

Recently the fighters have
been boring. It was better
when the King was around.

These martial arts
tournaments are okay...
But what if Gears, not
people, fought it out?
I'd like to see that.

Hey, are you for 
Joe too?

Big Joe's great 'cause
he's kinda shady.
Kids like you wouldn't
understand.

Wanna join Joe's fan club?
If you join, you can come
to our weekly coffee.
We have a dinner show
once a month too.

Hey are you fightin'?
Give it up. No way you 
can beat Joe.

I want to see what kind
of fighters came. The best
men all joined the army.

I love pure fighting.
Especially all those
different styles! I came
all the way from Dazil.

I hate war and fighting.
What? Oh I'm writing a book
on the folly of mankind.

Bart
"Fei, if anything, I'm
your friend right?"

Bart
"Sig...you won't change 
no matter what I do, 
will you?"

Maison
"What is the matter,
young master...?"

Bart
"Nah...I guess I have to
do what I was asked."

Bart
"My good people of Aveh...
This is Bartholomew Fatima
the 19th king of Aveh,
son of Edbart Fatima IV
the 18th king of Aveh.
First, one must apologize
for the trouble caused by
one's unavoidably lengthy
absence from the palace.
One especially wants to
give one's condolences to
those who lost family in
the war with Kislev.
One will immediately call a
truce with Kislev and begin
reparations to victims of
both countries.
All citizens drafted as
soldiers will also be
allowed to return home.
Let us work together
towards the rebuilding
of Aveh!"

Bart
"...One also has
another final but
important message...
A declaration from the
will of Edbart IV who
wished only for peace
for his kingdom, Aveh.
I Bartholomew Fatima, 
the 19th King of Aveh,
do hearby declare...
from this day forward
I shall abandon the
monarchy and create
the Republic of Aveh!"

Sigurd
"Young master..."

Maison
"What in Aveh 
are you doing...?"

Bart
"This is my father's wish.
I am sorry. You both have
worked so hard for many
long years to restore me
to the throne.
Now I'm no longer in line to
be king, nor anything else
for that matter, the two of
you are free to go."

Maison
"What are you saying...?"

Sigurd
"Unbelievable."

Maison
"Master Sigurd?"

Sigurd
"Can't you hear the 
crowd outside?
They have chosen you as
their king. You're going
to be very busy."

Bart
"Sig..."

Sigurd
"Won't you need some
capable assistance?"

Bart
"Well...here goes 
nothing."

!

!

We will protect Aveh.

0872 - Bledavik - Bart and Sigurd Talk About Mother
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigurd
"Young master...?"

Bart
"Yeah, I can't sleep."

Sigurd
"Yes, so much has 
happened at once."

Bart
"Hey Sig...what was
your mother like?"

Sigurd
"...She died when I was
but a child,  why?"

Bart
"Do you have any 
memories of her?
What kind of person
was she?"

Sigurd
"Hmmm, well... 
she was very kind...
but when I was born it
seems the doctor told 
her she did not have
long to live.
She lived in constant
fear of that.
As a result, even if she
met someone she liked,
her fear of death was
her drawback.
She worried that she
could not be with me
to the very end..."

Bart
"What about your father?"

Sigurd
"He isn't supposed to
know that I was born.
However, even for not
knowing he still
treated me like a son."

Bart
"Why didn't you tell
him you were his son?"

Sigurd
"If my mother hid that
fact, there had to be
a reason."

Bart
"There is more to my
father's will than what
I declared today.
I must share my
inheritance with
my brother.
He also said...
'You must split you
and your brother's
share with the people.'"

!

Bart
"That had always bugged
me up until now. I didn't
know what he meant.
That's all I wanted to
say...
Good night!"

It's locked.

    Go out
    Return

!

Hey, what is it that
we're guarding here?

We're here to chase
out anyone from the
Tournament who gets
lost in the castle.

Babysitters, huh? 
Well, when it gets to
the pre-semi-finals
we'll go check out
the Tournament.

Yeah, 
let's do that.

Oh man, if that
guy wins...

That's right.

Gimme my 100G back!

Oh well.
What a waste.

!

"See ya, you bald geezer!
We'll settle this later."

Bart
"Till then...
go get your
head waxed!"

Bart
"Let's go!"

!

Sigurd
"Crap! An ambush!"

Citan
"Oh-oh...!
Where is Kahr...?"

Miang
"I see you are quick
to catch on.
Ramsus should be taking
care of all your divided
forces out by the Nisan
border as we speak.
Ramsus easily saw through
your plan to use a feint
attack by Kislev long ago.
Don't underestimate us...
Hyuga, have you lived
down here so long that
your mind has slipped?
And Sigurd, who would have
thought you would have
joined the last survivors
of the royal dynasty..."

Sigurd
"Damn it...why are you
still backing Shakhan?
What does it matter to
you who the king is?"

Miang
"Hah! You suggest the son
of murdered King Fatima?
He refused to cooperate!
You mean to say that now
he wants to be our
puppet all of a sudden?
That I don't believe...
even coming from the mouth
of a traitor like you.
Ha ha ha... Besides,
stupidity in puppets
has its advantages."

Shakhan
"Stu, stupidity!?
Miang, what's that
supposed to mean?"

Miang
"Minister Shakhan, I'll let
you handle this. You must
protect your own position.
We don't care who is
sitting on the throne.
Any obedient sheep
would be fine.
However, isn't there 
something that you
still have to do?
If you will only do that,
then we'll help you as
much as possible."

Shakhan
"Yes, you don't have
to tell me.
One must take care of
one's own country's
criminals personally."

Miang
"Then, with your
permission I shall
take my leave..."

Bart
"Hey now! 
Wait a minute!!"

Miang
"Goodbye...boys."

Shakhan
"You pirate...no you're
just a sandworm. You've
caused me enough shame.
But this is the end. You
didn't know your place
and now all that awaits
you is annihilation.
Prepare to fire...!"

Shakhan
"Wha!?"

Maison
"You wretched rebel,
Shakhan!
Make one move and
this gatling gun
shall be spitting
fire!"

Bart
"Old Maison!"

Maison
"Reinforcements have
arrived, young master.
Please come aboard."

Maison
"Shall we depart?"

Shakhan
"Is this some kind of joke?
Hmm, It seems sandworms
can't fly after all.
Just surrender.
Thanks for the laughs...
I almost hate to have
to shoot you."

Bart
"Crap! I guess we're
gonna get mauled..."

Maison
"Everyone...
please get down."

Bart
"Do you have a
plan, Maison?"

Maison
"Leave it to me."

Bart
"Maison, you're just
walking in circles."

Maison
"Just leave it to me."

Bart
"You've saved us the
trouble of finding you,
Shakhan! Now get ready!"

Shakhan
"We've been
expecting you!"

Bart
"What!?"

I take all that trouble

There goes my chance for
glory."

0888 - Bart Confronts Maison about Sigurd's Eyes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maison
"Oh, young master!
You still haven't
rested yet?" 

Bart
"Old Maison, there is
one thing I want to
ask you."

Maison
"What is it?"

Bart
"Where was Sigurd born?"

Maison
"Young master, that..."

Bart
"He has blue eyes...
it's the Fatima Jasper."

Maison
"...Well...
It was long ago.
When his Majesty and
I were still young...
Long before his Majesty
knew my young master's
mother.
His Majesty was in love
with a certain girl
from a small religious
sect east of Aveh.
This sect was quite
different from Nisan and
the 'Ethos' but she was
very beautiful.
Then...
she just disappeared.
Later there were rumors
of her having a child."

Bart
"She disappeared?
Did father abandon her?"

Maison
"As far as I know, it was
the opposite. His Majesty
was abandoned."

Bart
"Sig is from Aveh's
eastern desert..."

Maison
"Indeed. When he was 10, he
was assigned to his Majesty
King Edbart, as a squire."

Oh my, Major Vanderkaum!
Bringing this thing
into the room...
It's going to be so
difficult to clean
with this here.

I thought Maison would
clean that up for me, 
but instead, when he saw
it, he got so excited.
Men...

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek

...Due to confusing
orders, we were not able
to do well in our prior
campaign against growing
patrols around the ruins.
So we must immediately 
restructure our system
of giving orders.
Have you any ideas?

General, the problem
is that pushy Major
Vanderkaum. He...

Hold your tongue!
I understand your resentment
towards Major Vanderkaum,
but we don't want any bad 
feelings with Gebler.

I'm sorry. 
What about that new guy,
Ramsus? What about him?

I've heard he is 
rather talented...
He shouldn't trouble
us like that Vanderkaum.

That surprise attack
was amazing.

But, he is an outsider.
You can't trust him!

Who's there? 

Stop daydreaming!
Arrest the intruder! 

Do you know what the
biggest problem is since
the end of the war with 
Kislev?
The excavation rights to 
the ruins in Dazil!
Soldiers in the area have
to protect those rights.
Drafted soldiers are being
sent home so career veterans
must be reorganized.
But until the reorganized units
arrive, the guards at the
ruins can't return.

Tournament
Semi-Finals

Fei
"What are you doing
here, Dan!?"

Fei
"...Please, Dan.
Stop it!"

Fei
"Ergh...
What do you want
me to do...?"

Fei
"...I can't.
There's no way I could
ever bring myself to
strike you, Dan..."

Fei
"Dan...
I..."

Dan
"Hmph!
I escaped from
Yui's place!
I'm here to avenge
my sister's death!"

Dan
"Shut ya mouth! I will
never forgive you.
...You murderer!!"

Dan
"Damn you, Fei!
Why don't you
fight back?
C'mon,
I challenged
you!"

Dan
"...Darn!
Taking you down so
easily like this isn't
going to satisfy
the souls of my sister
or Timothy!
Blast! I'll save this
duel for later.
The next time I meet
you, it's going to be
your funeral! Scum!
Until then,
hang on to this!
Every time you look
at it,
I want you to suffer
and feel the guilt for
what you did !"

Dan
"Shut up!
I don't want to hear
your stupid excuses!
Fei, you're such
a bastard!!"

Took possession of
 Alice's

Bledavik Tournament - Fei vs Wiseman - file33
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tournament's Final Bout

Fei
(This is not good.
At this rate...)

Fei
"??"

Fei
"Who cares where...
Come on, now...
Put up a serious fight!"

Fei
"Why do you
ask that for?"

Fei
"My reasons for
fighting are none
of your business!"

Fei
"Would you shut up!
I'm in the middle of
finding for my purpose!"

Fei
"What!?"

Fei
"How would
you know...?"

Fei
"Argh!
Shut up!!"

Fei
"!!
How do you
know my name!?
I deliberately didn't
use my real name when
I entered this contest.
And that thing about
me recovering from my
wounds...!? You aren't
who I think you are!?"

Fei
"!! Wait!
I want to
ask you...!"

Fei
"Wiseman..."

Wiseman
"...Just as I thought."

Wiseman
"You, where did you
learn that technique?"

Wiseman
"Hmm.
So then why
do you fight?
For yourself?
Or for the sake
of others?"

Wiseman
"Doesn't there have to
be a reason or a goal,
for a person to fight?"

Wiseman
"So, you are you
fighting for no
reason or goal?"

Wiseman
"... Then forget it!
For there's no way
you could find such."

Wiseman
"You appear to be
looking forward...
...but in reality,
you are only
looking downward!
You're only looking
at yourself.
Like that, you will
find nothing."

Wiseman
"I know... By exchanging
blows with you, I can
tell a great deal..."

Wiseman
"Weak, weak... You won't
even graze me with those
kinds of attacks...
But superficially, at
least, it seems you've
matured physically."

Wiseman
"You've done well in
recovering from those
wounds, Fei..."

Wiseman
"...Hm!?"

Wiseman
"Oh my...
Is it already
that time...?
... I guess it can't
be helped...
I've got to be
on my way!"

Spectators
"Boo~! Boo~!"
"Booooring!"
"C'mon, fight properly!!"

Spectators
"...grumble grumble..."
Referee
"...Uhh, ahem.
It appears that
competitor Wiseman
has forfeited...
The remaining
competitor will
automatically be
awarded victory!"
Spectators
"What!? Are you serious!?"
"Booo! Booooo!!"
"Yeah! I won the bet!!"

I'm busy!
Get outta my way!

I thought I'd have 
lots of free time
once the war ended.
But these guys are
always in the dining
hall.
So I'm real busy! 
Outta my way!

While this is warming,
I'll get this ready... 
Was I cutting vegetables?
No, wait... Hey, your
talking to me got me all
mixed up.

I wonder how the 
Tournament's going?
I'd like to go see
it  but the head
chef won't let me.

I wonder if the

I wonder if the

I wonder if the

Hey, thanks to you 
I hit it big. 
Thank you.

Ma yelled at me because
you lost so quickly!

This is enough seasoning. 
They will all be tired out 
from today's Tournament.

Can't fight on an
empty stomach...
Even without a fight,
you still can't do much
when you're hungry.

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0894
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We're not interested
in gambling, right?

We're not interested
in politics, right?

Yep

What do you think of
those two in front?
    Kinda strange
    Nothing

Actually those two 
are...twins.
You should see them 
infiltrate enemy 
positions. Their timing
is simply amazing.

Yeah...? Well,
to each his own...

I wonder how long it's
gonna take to fix the 
fan above the table?

The fan's completely
stopped.

Look! 
The fan's finally fixed.

Whenever we've got nothing
to do, we all tend to hang
around this room.

Yep, a festival
means liquor.

You got it!

Oh man...
The guy we all bet on 
lost his first fight.
Now all we can do is
drink.

You got it!

What's an election?

We can choose any
ol' king we want.

Oh yeah?

Everyone in Aveh decides?

Everyone picks one guy
and the most popular
one becomes king.

Oh yeah?

Hmm, interesting.
I wonder who I
should pick?

I'm pickin' my mom.

What!?
Don't do that!

If we were ever under
enemy attack then we
couldn't rest, right?
That's the time when a
leisurely meal is a 
real luxury.

This much free time makes
the body soft.

The castle cook makes
excellent food.

Of course! He cooks for
the king, don't he?

I wish my wife's 
food was this good.

My old lady's food
is edible but...

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek

Bledavik - Aveh's True History - 0896
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We must rewrite all
false history books
on the monarchy.
We also must get rid
of any books that
might cause problems.

But now, any pre-Shakhan
records are getting dated.
Strange how the present
becomes the past.

I am rearranging all the
records that were hidden
from Shakhan.
I was told to burn them,
but I hid them instead.

Do you know the history of Bledavik?
    Yes, I do
    No, I don't

Wow, you know a lot.

This city was built on a
desert rockbed. This was
partially to escape sand
erosion, but that's not
all.
An underground water basin
wells up here. The rockbed
is made of limestone, so
the water level continued
to rise to its present level.
Fatima Castle was originally
built to protect the water
source, but gradually the
desert people started to
live here.
They were soon joined by a
steady flow of people from
the northern lands.
That is the story of this
city, Bledavik.

'Aveh's True History'
...In the dark days of the
Fatima rule, the people had
little to eat and even less
to be happy about.
Their hardships peaked during
the reign of Edbart IV...
Using the people's fury as
his power base, Shakhan, the
Prime Minister then, lead
the armies that broke the
tyrany of the Fatima dynasty.
Those heroes became the 
nucleus of Aveh's current
armed forces...

It is said the founder of Aveh,
one Roni Fatima, was part of a
desert caravan, but he probably
also had other sides to him.
The myths speak of the
involvement of giants in
battles that were part of
a massive power struggle.
Almost all the records from
that time have been lost, and
what little remains is doubted
as being historically correct.
But then Roni Fatima could have
been behind altering things.

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0898
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm...I'm worried. 
The army's power is
rising too quickly...
What will happen to
civilian officials
like me?

Hmm...I'm worried. 
If political power 
changes hands...
what will happen to
those working for
Shakhan?

Well if it isn't his
Highness, Bartholomew!?
It has been a long time.
Are you well my Highness?

My family has served
in Fatima Castle for 
generations, no matter
who was in power.

There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek

Citan
"This time when the 
government changes, the
implications are huge.
We must succeed at all
costs."

Bart
"...Sig and I will
take two men and head
for the top floor.
Citan, you take the two
remaining men and open
the castle gate to let
in our main force.
If we can catch Shakhan
we are sure to succeed."

Citan
"Right. When you capture 
Shakhan give the signal.
It is probably best to 
open the gate at that 
time."

Bart
"Above us is the
Castle Bailey.
The keep must fall
quickly.
Shakhan should be
on the top floor."

Sigurd
"...In the room that
used to be used by the
young master's father.
Try not to damage the
castle, avoid all need-
less combat, and above
all, remember - speed!"

Bart
"That's why there are so
few of us.
Our objective is Shakhan!
So ignore the Gebler and
Aveh soldiers."

Bart
"Alright, let's
move on out!"

Sigurd
"Young master, don't
try to be a hero...
just get the job done."

Damn Shakhan...
When I get a hold of him
I'll swing him around by
his hair...after I've given
him a hair transplant.

Pull yourself together.

Let's not fight with
our cousins in the Aveh
army and finish this.

Soon I'll return to the
castle! I wonder if the
old man from the dining
hall is still alive?

Congratulations on your
return, your Highness.
I knew this day would come
and have been protecting
the water reservoir.
I knew you didn't die.

Even though the war
is over, this old man
has no home or family
to return to.
My only family is this
stray cat.

Kid, how many times
must I tell you...hmm?
How many years has it
been?
Well, haven't you grown
up? Are you really the
child I used to play
hide-and-seek with?
Is this some sort of
joke...?
Well, answer me!?

Bart
"What're you babblin'
on about?
Old man, even back when
I was a child you used
to ramble on and on. But
I see it's gotten worse."

What!?
Ramble!?
Did you say I rambled on?
Why you little brat.
The only people who I ever
allowed to call me a rambler
were my late mother and the
young prince.
His Highness...
what was his name?

Bart
"You mean his Highness
'Prince Bartholomew'."

Yes, his Highness Prince
Bartholomew! Boy, you 
certainly know a lot.
If Bartholomew was still
alive he'd be just about
your age...
Did you know that both
he and his family were
killed by that Shakhan?
You won't beat me, 
Shakhan. I'll protect
Aveh's water till I die.
In rememberance of the 
kindness of the king and 
the young prince.

I'll protect Aveh's water 
till I die. In rememberance 
of the kindness of the king 
and the young prince.

Bart
"Really? Thanks old man. 
Father would be glad."

? 
...Whaddya mean, father?
Are you the son of an
acquaintance of mine?
Wait wait, I remember...
! 
No, no, that's not it.
I don't recall the king
having any secret sons.

Bart
"Sorry but I don't have 
time to explain. You'll 
remember. See ya!"

Old Man
Who was that...?

Could this be...His
Highness Bartholomew?
It's been a long time.
You were still a child
when your father, the
King, passed away.
How I miss those days.
I am glad to see that
you are still alive!

Bart
"Old man, that was then
but this is now.
When things calm down,
I'll come back."

What!? Playing in the
reservoir again? Get up 
out of there now, boy!

What!?
You can't go in there! 
Everyone drinks from
that water!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you think women
are weaker than men?
    I think so
    Not really

What? Don't you under-
estimate desert women!

You're just saying
that to impress me.

Aren't you nervous?
I've had to pee a couple
times already.
I have to go again. 
...again.

I am strong...
I am strong...
I am strong...

Do you know my name?
    Yes I do
    Nope

That's right...
I am the one and
only...'Big Joe'!

What, you don't 
remember? I am...
Big Joe!
The man who
controls 
the world.

Big Joe
"Hey, boy.
Do you know the
secret of strength?
It's...
Gratitude to all your
fans. Their love gives
me strength."

Hey, boy. Do you have
anyone cheering for you?
    Yes
    No

Big Joe
"OK, don't forget 
to thank them."

Big Joe
"Oh boy. Life is too 
long to walk alone."

0908 - Plan to Aim Mirror at Ethos
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"Thanks to you, Aveh has
been taken back from
Shakhan and Gebler.
Thank you.
Now, in order to free
other lands from
Gebler and Solaris...
...we must destroy the
other two gates and
bring down Solaris.
We've learned from
Shakhan's notes that the
gates form the points 
of a triangle."

One point was the Great
Mausoleum. 
Two others remain, but we
only know where one is.

Citan
"Yes, under the 'Ethos'
headquarters. However..."

Billy
"It wasn't there when we
followed Stone under
the 'Ethos' headquarters.
If it really is there...
it must be buried deep
beneath the earth..."

Rico
"How are we gonna 
destroy it then?"

Chu-Chu
"By combining
everyone's
Gear power."

Rico
"What are we gonna do 
with everyone's Gear,
dig a giant hole in
the ground?"

Chu-Chu
"What's wrong
with that?"

Sigurd
"...it would take years."

Fei
"What if we used 
Shevat's cannon..."

Maria
"If that worked, we would
have tried it already."

Fei
"...Oh..."

Citan
"So it must be something
more powerful than
Shevat's cannon."

Elly
"And we don't have a
Gebler battleship."

Fei
"Is there any weapon
that powerful on earth?"

Citan
"Gebler battleships and
Shevat's cannon are the
most powerful weapons
ever produced by man..."

Bart
"...but...
I seem to remember
seeing something..."

Sigurd
"What?"

Bart
"A weapon with firepower
like those two...
Yeah! I got it!
Ft. Jasper!
Her gun can take out
a mountain!
What about that?"

Bart
"Citan, what?"

Citan
"However powerful the Jasper
may be, how are we going to
aim it at the 'Ethos' H.Q.?
To damage something that
deep underground we would
have to attack it from
directly above.
But the Jasper gun is..."

Sigurd
"Yes, of course..."

Rico
"What, are you sayin' we
should just move Ft.
Jasper on top of Babel?"

Billy
"Now that you mention it,
Babel does overlook their
headquarters.
If we shoot it from there
it might just possibly be
able to reach that far
underground."

Sigurd
"But how could we move
Ft. Jasper?"

Elly
"It's impossible.
Something that heavy..."

!

Fei
"Didn't the control room
in Babel control a
cannon or something?
I think it moved the
giant mirror outside."

Bart
"Maria, do you know
of anything like that?"

Maria
"I've never heard
anything about it but..."

Fei
"But it might be there.
Let's go check."

Bart
"Alright..."

!

Citan
"Wait a moment...
A giant mirror and a giant
cannon both from the same
ruins? There might just be
something in this..."

Bart
"Like what?"

Citan
"Ah...
I have solved
the puzzle..."

Sigurd
"Puzzle, what puzzle?"

Citan
"The Babel and Jasper
ruins are from the same
civilzation.
One far more advanced
than our own...
Do not the two structures
seem similar to you?
I believe they were both
built with Gears and a
powerful foe in mind."

Fei
"Yeah, I noticed that. 
But what's it all mean?"

Citan
"It means, the people
who built the giant
mirror at Babel Tower...
...knew about the giant
gun at Jasper!"

Bart
"And...?
What are you
getting at?"

Citan
"We can probably assume
the mirror was built to
reflect something...
That something being a
beam. A beam shot from
the Jasper gun!"

Fei
"Reflect?
You mean that mirror can
reflect a beam attack?"

Citan
"Yes."

Rico
"Long ago Babel and
Jasper must have
been at war."

Citan
"Not exactly.
The Babel mirror and
Jasper gun were combined
to make one weapon."

Rico
"Whaddya mean?"

Elly
"But those things are so
far apart, how could they
be one weapon?"

Citan
"Well the gates may be
far apart, but aren't
they still one device?"

Elly
"Yes, I see what
you mean but..."

Billy
"What did they use
that weapon for?"

Citan
"That, I do not know."

Bart
"Whatever. The point is
how do we use the
two weapons as one?"

Citan
"Aim the Jasper gun at
the mirror and fire.
The mirror will reflect
the beam on the gate."

!

Maria
"Do you think it will
work?"

Citan
"Theoretically.
It will require a few
minor adjustments..."

Sigurd
"Adjusting the mirror
is going to be rather
difficult and tedious."

Citan
"If the two weapons are
one, then it should not
be too difficult.
I hope..."

Rico
"It sounds dangerous.
I think it was meant to
reflect shots back at
the enemy.
If you're wrong it'll
come back and hit you."

Citan
"Yes. That is why it is
most difficult for the
gun crew.
The mirror must be hit
precisely."

Citan
"We will need to divide
into two teams.
One will fire the gun...
While the other will adjust
the angle of the mirror to
ensure the beam hits the
'Ethos' headquarters.
Since this was my idea,
I will take the dangerous
part of adjusting the
mirror."

Sigurd
"Alright Hyuga, we'll
let you take care of
that...
...It seems like
your type of job."

Fei
"I'll go too.
Doc might need help."

Elly
"It might be lonely with
just Citan and Fei.
So I had better go too."

Sigurd
"Alright, you three take
Babel. Now what about
the gun?"

Billy
"I'll do it. Looks like
my kind of job.
Don't worry, I won't
miss. I haven't been
using a gun for nothing."

Bart
"Well, I probably better
go to the Jasper."

Chu-Chu
"Me chu! Chu-Chu 
wants to go chu!"

Bart
"Then it's settled.
You go with Citan to aim
the mirror at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
We'll aim the Jasper gun
at the mirror.
Let's get back to the
Yggdrasil and get going!"
ggdrasil and get going!"

Margie's Rescue - Bart & Margie run into Ramsus & Myahh - 0910

Margie
"Bart!
Look!"

Bart
"Crap!
Gebler!"

Ramsus
"Looks like we have rats.
Where do you plan on
taking that girl, boy?"

Bart
"Boy? Hah, boy!?!
Let's see you try and
call me that again!
Who the hell are you
anyway?"

Ramsus
"You do have spunk. But
I don't need to give my
name to rats like you."

Bart
"What?"

Ramsus
"Now hand over the girl.
She is a very important
guest.
Until she tells us where a
certain piece of the Fatima
Jasper is, we can't allow
her to be taken away."

Bart
"Gimme a break! You think
I'm gonna hand her over
just 'cause you say to?
Pull your head out, you
Gebler geek!"

Ramsus
"Hmm. I assume you know
where such abusive
language will lead you."

Bart and Margie vs Miang and Ramsus - file57

Fei
"Bart!!"

Margie
"Ba-arty!"

Margie
"No!
I'll fight too!"

Bart
"Oh yeah?
You know about me,
huh?
Heh! It's not such a bad
feeling having your name
known by someone as
beautiful as you."

Bart
"That's nice to know.
But I can't accept it.
See, for me,
'either way' is bad."

Bart
"Tch... Margie!
Hide back behind
there!"

Bart
"I don't care,
just hide!"

Ramsus
"...Then it's
decided."

Miang
"If you truly want to
protect that child,
then surrender...
Prince Bartholomew!"

Miang
"You may have had your
problems with Shakhan,
but we won't treat you
badly.
Concerning Shakhan, it
really doesn't matter
'either way' to us."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"You okay, Bart?"

Bart
"Glad you're here Fei!"

Ramsus
"Fei?"

Fei
"What's wrong, Bart?
I thought this was
just a simple rescue."

Bart
"Shut up! This jerk butted
in and slowed me down!"

Ramsus
(The way he attacked...
It reminds me of someone
from my past...)

Ramsus
"Enough talk!
Battling will reveal
the truth about you."

Bart
"Careful Fei!
This Gebler jerk's
pretty strong."

But that techinique
was indeed his...)
(What's more...
the name Fei....
where have I...)

Fei...
That is my child's name...

Ramsus

Ramsus
"Gah!"

Ramsus
"Rats?"

Margie
"Leave the rest
to me!"

Bart
"Margie?"

Fei
"Now!"

Ramsus
(Is it 'him'?
Or do I only want
to think so...
If it is 'him'...
I...
I am...)

...Worthless...
...A reject...

Ramsus
"GUARD! Double the
guards on both shifts.
Don't let those rats
in here again."

Shakhan

Commander Ramsus is
here to see her."

Ramsus
"I am Ramsus, she is
Miang. We would like to
ask you some questions."

Margie
"I'm Margie.
Actually it's Marguerite.
What do you want to know?
My favorite food? I like
cake, Chiffon Nisan is my
favorite. I haven't had
it in so long..."

Ramsus
"Marguerite, we want to
ask you about the Fatima
family treasure...
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'. You see,
I'm keeping the piece
you had in a safe place.
But I don't know where
the other piece is.
Do you?"

Margie
"Nope.
The one I had you took
from me.
You didn't even give
me anything for it.
Hey, the next time you
come, could you bring
some Chiffon Nisan?
I used to eat it
everyday in Nisan.
I don't think they
make it in Aveh.
Aveh used to have such
good bakers, but I
guess they must have
all died in the war."

Ramsus
"That is too bad.
I don't know much about
cake, but I'll see if I
can find some for you
next time."

Margie
"Thank you Ramsus.
I'll be waiting."

Ramsus
"Is there anything else
you need?
If there's something you
want I'll bring it next
time."

Margie
"No. I just want to go
back to Nisan. They must
be so worried about me."

Ramsus
"I'm sorry but please
wait a little longer.
We want you to stay
here until we find
the other half of the
'Fatima Jasper'."

?

Who are you?

!

Margie
"Bart!"

Bart
"Let's go
home Margie!"

Margie
"I just knew you'd 
come for me!"

Bart
"I'm getting
you outta here!
C'mon, follow me!"

Margie
"Okay."

Margie
"Oh, wait
a second."

Margie
"I really
like this."

Thank you so much
for rescuing Mother
Marguerite.
All of us in the Nisan
Sect are deeply indebted
to you.

Today we came to pray to
god for peace in Aveh,
Nisan and Kislev. 
Peace be with you all.

Please wait a moment.

We are grateful to you
for rescuing Mother
Marguerite.
Thanks to you, we can
return to Nisan overjoyed.

Please wait a moment.

We would like to build
Nisan churches in
Bledavik and Dazil.

Please wait a moment.

This is the room 
Mother Marguerite was 
locked away in.
She must have been so
terrified.

    Entrance
    Outer Bailey
    Citadel, 3rd floor
    Dining Hall

Is it all right?

Shakhan
"I can't prevent them from
meeting her. Not when it's
him we are talking about...
Besides, Marguerite isn't
talking anyway.
So there is no need to
worry...
But where did the leak
about the Jasper come
from...?
...The 'Ethos'?
Ridiculous...! Hmmm,
if this continues my
plans will be..."

Shakhan
"We had better find out
who is leaking out our
information immediately.
In the meantime, we'll
have to administer some
truth serum to our
guest, Miss Marguerite.
We must find the other
piece of the 'Fatima
Jasper' as quickly as
we can."

But...

Shakhan
"However spineless the last
commander, Vanderkaum,
was...
...this time Gebler has
sent their highest
commanding officer.
His country is throwing all
their weight into this.
And, there is nothing we
can do about it!"

It was nothing."

Miang
"Kahr..."

Miang
"Peeping is not
very becoming,

Miang
"Heh heh... I saw the boy
that you are after fight
in the Tournament...
I could tell right away.
He resembles you greatly."

Grahf
"You used the influence
of the Ministry to set
you up with that man...
I don't know what you are
up to, but don't you dare
think about plotting
against me.
You stay out of this!"

Miang
"Oh, I see the news has
already reached you...
As usual, you're the
first to hear about
everything.
But don't worry...
I won't steal your
'prized possession'.
I'll cooperate...
Besides, you and I
go back a long way..."

...The number one gate
generator is 200 kelt
southwest of Nortune and
4000 sharl underground.
Its interference waves make
guided weapon use impossible
in this area. So up to the
last minute the Hecht must
be piloted manually.
After canceling stealth
mode, you will provide
direct escort for the Hecht
inside the enemy defense
zone. Any questions?

Elly
"Well..."

Yes Lieutenant?

Elly
"I understand our escort
orders but what is our
main objective?"

That is classified.

Elly 
"But without knowing our
objective, our response to
any orders will be slow.
Even if we're just ordered
to provide cover.
We need to at least know
the attack objective..."

The objective will be issued
during the mission.
It will be relayed directly
to the Hecht's pilots.

Elly
"But..."

Your only concern is to
protect the Hecht from
the enemy's anti-aircraft 
weapons. 
Any problems with that?

Elly
"...No...
if that's the case..."

Anything else?

...Then this ends the 
main briefing.
Confirm terrain, weather
and enemy defense details
with the information at
hand.
The mission starts at
1700.
Until then wait in your
assigned units.
I shouldn't have to
remind you that this
mission is a purge.
Remember, we have
complete authority
over the Lambs. 
Dismissed.

Stratski
"This sucks Lieutenant.
How can we go along with
this? What's he mean the
objective has nothing to
do with us?"

Elly
"Be quiet!
I'm thinking!"

Stratski
"Don't snap at me."

Vance
"I hate hysterical women."

the consequences for
that remark?"

"Uh..."

Elly
"Hurry!
This way!"

Elly
"Whew..."

Renk
"What's wrong?
Something 
bugging you?"

Elly
"Sorry I'm so edgy.
Those self-detonating
bombs are just air units
with Kief class bombs
on board.
I don't see why they
need to use them all of
a sudden...
There are just too many.
One of those alone would
have enough firepower,
but 8 of them is overkill.
They haven't told us our
target yet, and we're not
just going to drop them
for fun.
You bet I'm worried."

Helmholz
"Maybe to purge 
the Lambs?"

Elly
"They're human...
the same as us, right?
They have to give us a
reason. I can't go along
with this just because
it's an order."

Renk
"Hmm..."

Elly
"What?"

Renk
"Nothing..."

Renk
"Even though we are called
Solarians, we are 3rd Class
Citizens or 'Worker Bees'.
Us 3rd Class Citizens have
our origins in the 'Lambs'.
I can understand us having
doubts in such orders...
But you, you're different.
You're a pure 1st Class
Citizen and come from a
good family.
I've heard your father
has a lot of pull in the
military..."

Elly
"My family and father
have nothing to do
with it."

Renk
"Well, if you ask me,
a 1st Class citizen
thinking like this is...
a little unusual."

Elly
"Not really...
It's quite natural."

Helmholz
"...So, how about it?
Are you gonna do it?"

Stratski
"The army will demote
us all back to being
3rd Class citizens!"

Elly
"Don't worry. I'll just
do my duty. But I'm only
escorting the Hecht.
I won't help with 
anything else."

Helmholz
"...But, what if
something happens?
You're just backing
yourself into a corner."

Elly
"...Can't be helped,
I guess..."

Renk
"Well, either is fine
for us. Just do what
you're told.
Nothing else matters."

!

Elly
"Fei!"

Fei
"You're...Elly?
What are you
doing here?"

Elly
"I should be
asking you!"

Elly
"Don't tell me you're
the intruders, Fei?"

Fei
"Huh?"

Bart
"If she's in our way,
just..."

Fei
"Wait a second, Bart!"
She...Elly is not an
enemy!"

Bart
"Not an enemy? Are you
sane? Look at her uniform!
She's a Gebler officer!"

Fei
"..."

Elly
"Wait here a second."

Elly
"The coast is clear!
Quick, follow me!"

They ran in here!

There are intruders
in the base!

There are three intruders...

...presently heading
for the dock area.

The two men may be killed...

...but do not harm the girl.

Elly
"It sounds like
they've gone..."

Bart
"Fei, can you explain
to me how you know a
Gebler officer?"

Fei
"Well..."

Bart
"I don't know where you
met her, but no matter
how you look at it...
she's a Gebler officer!
Not an enemy? Where do
you get off saying that?"

Elly
"Yes.
Special Forces of the
Sacred Empire of Solaris...
also known as Gebler...
I'm Lt. Elhaym Van Houten
of the Ignas Army's Third
Assault Division.
And...while returning from
a mission to capture the
newest model Gear from a
Kislev military factory...
...I was attacked by
pursuing Kislev Gears and
crash-landed in your
village..."

Fei
"..."

Elly
"I wanted to tell you,
but I just couldn't
bring myself to...
When I heard what my
crash-landing in your
village had caused...
I couldn't tell you..."

Fei
"...I knew."

Elly
"!? 
Fei..."

Fei
"I overheard you
talking with doc."

Elly
"Then why?"

Fei
"It was...all my fault.
But I lashed out at you 
with my own feelings...
I'm sorry."

Elly
"No it wasn't..."

Fei
"Just forget about it.
You couldn't help it...
You had your own problems."

Elly
"But, Fei...
why are you
with them?"

Fei
"I'm cooperating with 
Bart and his crew.
We came to rescue Margie
who was taken prisoner
in the castle here."

Elly
"I see..."

Bart
"Hey! Just a minute!
Where do you think 
you're going?"

Elly
"You want to get out of
the castle, right?
In this confusion you can
escape through the Gear
launch door."

Bart
"Great idea! But...
do we really buy that?
I don't think so! She talks
sweet, but she's probably
planning to turn us over to
that old bald geezer.
It's a trick, Fei!"

Fei
"..."

Margie
"Wait Bart!
She's not a bad person.
She said she'd help us,
so let's go with her plan."

Bart
"You're always
like this!
Can't you see...
she's in Gebler!?
Don't be so damn
trusting!"

Margie
"That's not true...
is it, Elly?"

Bart
"Oh yeah? Look where
your ability to judge
characters got you...!"

Bart
"Fei, what about you?
Do you believe her?"

Fei
"I made up my
mind long ago."

Elly
"Fei..."

Bart
"Gah!
First you, now her!
The whole lot of you
can go jump off a
cliff for all I care!"

This thing wasn't
here before."

Bart
"Don't worry.
We'll get you back
home...somehow!"

Margie
"I'm not worried."

Bart
"Hey Fei, how did
the Tournament go?"

Fei
"Uh, I won...
I guess..."

Bart
"That's what I thought.
I knew you could do it."

 Fei
"I lost halfway
through..."

 Bart
"No way!?
I thought you'd
win for sure!"

Elly
"This is the Gear's
start up code.
You can start any
standard Gear with
this code."

Fei
"Elly?"

Elly
"This is all I can do
for you. The rest is up
to fate..."

Bart
"Alright! Let's go, Fei!"

Bart
"What are you doing?
Hurry up!"

Fei
"Elly!
Come with us!"

Elly
"!?"

Fei
"You're not the type
of person suited to
a place like this!"

Elly
"Fei..."

Bart
"You're just wasting
time talking!
They're coming!
We're gonna get caught!"

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"Thanks, but it's
impossible. I'm...
a Solaris soldier...
This is where I belong.
I can't go with you."

Fei
"Elly!"

Elly
"Fei, the next
time we meet...
we'll be enemies."

Commander!!

Renk
"What? This little girl's
our commanding officer?"

Broyer
"She's said to be
an elite from out
of Jugend."

Stratski
"She returned single-
handedly from the Kislev
infiltration operation."

Helmholz
"And 'empty-handedly' I
hear! No souvenirs for
the Commander, huh?"

Renk
"Yep, what a pretty
face. She's not the
soldier type."

Elly
"You there!
Is that how you address
a superior officer?
Remember your rank!"

Renk
"Oh, scary!"

Vance
"We don't care much for
rank...and we don't care
much for Renk either!
But just because you're
beautiful doesn't mean
you have to be cocky."

Broyer
"Ha! This jerk's
just jealous."

Vance
"What? I'm much prettier!
How could I be jealous?"

Stratski
"Hey, shut that perv up!
He gives me the creeps."

Renk
"And that's how it is...
So don't get in our way,
'Miss Lieutenant'."

Elly
"..."

Renk
"...Anyway, let's just
get this thing moving.
Can't tell what it can
do just by looking at
it."

Stratski
"What kind of machine is
this? I've never seen it
before."

Renk
"It's a new model Gear,
called Vierge, that's
for officers' use only.
It's said that people
with normal mental
power can't operate it."

Stratski
"So, she's still a
'Jugend' regardless
of having no ability?"

Vance
"Hah, this looks like
fun. Let's see what
she can do!"

Ramsus
"Miang, get my Wyvern
powered up now!
I must pursue them..."

Ramsus
"Stop the power up!
Recall all men back
to base and wait
for further orders!"

Ramsus
"...That fool.
What is he doing
down here now...?"

(Commander...
I've a message
from Hyu...)

Ramsus
"...What!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
0946
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Renk
"Hey look, check 
this out..."

Stratski
"There's only one
control ship...
The other 7 are all
Ether guided.
Just who the hell is
controlling all them?"

I never thought you'd
be the escort commander.

Elly
"Dominia!?"

Helmholz
"...Dominia, who's that?
Hey, not the one from
the Elements...?"

Dominia
"It's been a long time 
Elhaym. The last time
was Jugend, wasn't it?"

Elly
"What are you 
doing here?"

Dominia
"This is a vital mission,
ordered from central.
I already have Ramsus'
orders. The Hecht is not
to be piloted by a
common soldier.
I will take the Hecht."

Dominia
"I didn't even need an
escort, but this was
also part of the plan.
This will be a
good fight."

Elly
"Wait! Tell me what our
target is!
You should know."

Dominia
"That's restricted...
but I guess I can tell.
The electric generator
in the eastern sector of
Kislev's Imperial capital.
The target is a reactor
left there by an ancient
civilization."

Elly
"The reactor!? If you
attack that then Kislev
will..."

Dominia
"Probably most of it
will be destroyed.
The rest will be
uninhabitable
for hundreds of years."

Elly
"Why are you doing this?"

Dominia
"To purge, why else?
You may know this already,
Kislev has the Gatekeeper.
The original gate is
controlled by those
vulgar Lambs.
This land barrier was
made by our predecessors.
The Lambs are trying to
destroy the gate.
Are you going to
allow that?"

Elly
"That may be so...
but do we have the right
to get involved?"

Dominia
"Does that bother you?
Since when did you have
a conscience?
War, strife, betrayal,
deceit are all that are
on the Lamb's minds.
Surely you should know
that by looking at the
fools in this country.
Just let them loose and
see what they'd do.
They would pillage and
loot our world acting as
if they owned it.
Advanced knowledge or
tools aren't necessary
for common house pets.
We must lead them where
they belong."

Elly
"You were originally
a land dweller.
So why...?"

Dominia
"I was chosen by the
Commander!
Don't look at
me the same as those
stupid Lambs!"

Dominia
"Yes, well...
You've shirked the duty
that was instilled in you
since your Jugend days.
Arguing with you is a
waste of time."

Dominia
"I was a surface dweller
myself, but I'm going to
purge the -Lambs-.
I want you, the Shepherds,
-Abel-, to see with your
own eyes what I can do."

Fei
"...Gebler's aerial
battleship!"

Margie
"Yeah, but look
what's coming
out of it...!"

Shakhan
"Tomorrow is the 500th
anniversary of this
country.
Please come to the
dedication ceremony."

Shakhan
"There is a customary
Tournament after the
dedication ceremony..."

Ramsus
"What about the incident
in that report?"

Shakhan
"What? Oh, you mean the
500-year-old mobile weapon
excavated from the ruins?
Thanks to the help of the
'Ethos', the repairs are
complete.
I thought we could announce
it on the day of the
dedication ceremony..."

Ramsus
"Toys like that should
be given to Vanderkaum.
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'."

Shakhan
"I already have obtained
one half of the crest.
But I haven't been able
to get her to tell me
where the other half is.
She is a rather strong-
willed girl..."

Ramsus
"You're not being rough
with her, are you?"

Shakhan
"Of course not. I know
how you despise vulgar
acts like that."

Ramsus
"You said that girl is the
Holy Mother of Nisan...
Is she upstairs?"

Shakhan
"Yes, in the
east tower."

Ramsus
"Miang, could
it possibly be
a 'Relic'?"

Miang
"Yes. But there is still no
response. There seems to be
a barrier or something.
However, we do know from
the 500-year-old records
that one certainly exists
in this vicinity.
It's probably well
preserved too."

Ramsus
"...Let's meet her.
I want to talk to her
directly. Miang, you
come with me."

Miang
"Yes sir."

Fei
"That's..."

Bart
"Are you guys
in the mood for
another battle?"

Margie
"Bart, we better
get outta here...
and fast!"

Fei
"Quick...run!

Ramsus
"I can't believe you
were beaten by such
a small force...
I have only just
taken over my post
and already you have
embarrassed me!"

Vanderkaum
"I am sorry Commander.
They were more persistent
than we anticipated.
They had a new model Gear
that was very mobile.
I couldn't get a lock on
it with the main gun...
Otherwise there would have
been no way we could have
been beaten by such..."

Ramsus
"Fool!
Know when to use that
big gun, and on whom!
You failed because you
try to solve everything
with force.
You have muscles instead
of brains."

Vanderkaum
"Commander!!"

Ramsus
"Dismissed.
Go polish your beloved
1200 sem cannon."

Shakhan
"Well, well, Commander.
You've only just taken
command and already you
are achieving splendid
results.
You dispatched those
irksome Kislev units
in a matter of days...
I'm very impressed."

While we're wasting time
here, Bart's team is
already on their way
to the castle. Hurry!"

R, roger.

Elly
"That Gear!?
Don't tell me
it's Fei!?"

Broyer
"Hey, is that him?
The guy from before?"

Renk
"Yep.
That's him alright."

Broyer
"Good.
It's time for a rematch.
Don't fall behind, sister."

Renk
"You're in the way.
Why don't you stay over
there and just watch."

Stratski
"Yeah, yeah.
We can take care of
these guys on our own."

"Sorry about this."

You two okay!?"

"Why am I losing to a Lamb?
Something's wrong...
way wrong!!"

Renk
"Vance!!
Get a hold of yourself!"

Vance
"Oh yeah!?
I just need more!
I need more 'Drive'!!"

Elly
"...I can't do it.
I can't...fight
Fei...but..."

Elly
"The only thing left...
is to use the 'Drive'...
 
         But..."

Renk
"Don't!
Anymore 'Drive' and you'll
waste your mind!!"

Elly fights Fei on Drive - file15
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"No---!"

Fei
"...That voice!?
...Elly?
Elly, is that you?!?"

Fei
"Elly!?
Your face...!?
What's wrong?
Don't tell me you're
using that personality-
changing drug
that Bart told us
about!?"

Fei
"Elly, stop it!
Why must we
fight!?"

Fei
"Elly,
snap out of it!
Your emotions are
being controlled
by the drug!"

Fei
"That's a lie!
You once felt
responsible,
blaming yourself for
causing the incident
in Lahan by landing
there.
You were considerate
of me when I was
troubled...
The real you would
never say anything
like that!!"

Fei
"...Argh!
Elly...
Must I fight you!?"

Fei
"...What happened?
There's something
wrong with Elly.
I can probably
stop her now!!"

Fei
"Elly!
Wake up and
snap out of it!"

Fei
"Are you okay!? Elly!
What!?
Are the effects of
the drug wearing
off?"

Fei
"Is that it? Elly!
Is that what's
happening!?"

Fei
"Hang in there, Elly!
Don't let go of your
true self!"

Elly
"It has nothing to do
with you.
And would you quit
trying to be so
friendly!"

Elly
"Why? It's obvious.
It's divine
providence!
We are the chosen
people, the Abel...
Our purpose of existence
is to subordinate
the earth dwelling
'Lambs'.
...Those who stand
in our way must be
eliminated!"

Elly
"This is my true nature!
There is no other!"

Elly
"You talk as if you
would know... Yet
you know nothing!"

Elly
"Hahaha! Writhe!
Dance!! Die and rot in
obscurity here!"

Elly
"It looks like
it's over for
you.
I'll put you out
of your misery
now!"

Elly
"Fear not!
In return for treating
me so kindly, I will
kill you painlessly.
Farewell, Fei..."

Elly
"Fei...
What're you doing? You
shouldn't be here!"

Elly
"!!
That's...not...true...
I... No...I...don't
want this... Guh!"

Elly
"H, hel...p...
Th, this... isn't...
This isn't... me..."

Elly
"Uhh!...
Aagh... Ah...
M, my head..."

Elly
"Ugh!... Silence!
Impertinent fool!
I will not listen
to a Lamb..."

Elly
"Uuahh!"

Elly
"Sh, shut up!
I've no need for
outward appearances
of compassion.
...I, I, ... erh
F...Fe...i..."

Broyer
"Wow!
Did you see that?!"

Renk
"Those were Aerods!"

Vance
"Aerods?"

Helmholz
"Animum Ether Response-
Offensive Drones...
Commonly known as
Aerods...
Within Gebler, there
are only a handful of
people capable of
using them...
From what I hear,
it should only be
people from the
Elements Class."

Stratski
"B, but isn't it like,
a side effect of the
'Drive'?
It's no big deal,
right...?"

Renk
"...No, the Drive can
only draw upon the
potential that already
exists in her.
Your looking at...
the real thing boys!"

W, what are you doing?

I don't want it!
I, I don't want to use it!

Please!
Go away!

What're you doing to me?
Don't touch me!

No!
Let go of me!

Please!
Stop!

You have no recollection?
         There were no records on
         mental enhancement drug
         use up until now.
Then it was sudden.
         She's probably a type that
         can't handle the 'Drive'.
That probably caused her
lapse into delerium.
     And her loss of self control?
         You mean an unconscious
         burst of pent-up antipathy?
         But everyone has that.

Is that why the innate
ability is so high?
        Yes...What did the Commander
        call those girls again?
        It's probably higher than
        they are.
Then it's an instantaneous
jump in numerical value.
        But, we can't use her as
        a test subject in front
        of Erich.
It's a pity we can't manage it...
since there is so much potential.

 We'll leave you to
 the bureau.
 
 Stay at your residence
 until further notice.
 
 Don't worry!
 You have power worthy
 of the chosen one's.
 
 It's those weak people's
 fault for not being able
 to withstand your powers.

Please!
Stop it!

Don't worry.
It's just the 'Drive'.

The 'Drive' will
just readjust your
balance and make
you feel good.

You think we're going
to make an exception
because your father's
top brass?

I don't think I
like your attitude!

What's with your
hair? Isn't it awfully red
for a 1st Class citizen?

Are you really a
1st Class citizen?

Fei
"Elly, why...?"

Elly
"I warned you...
I said the next time we met
we'd be...enemies."

Fei
"But, there's no reason for
you to do this to yourself
just so you can fight.
There's no reason for you
and I to fight...
None at all."

Elly
"There...was no other
choice..."

Elly
"I'm a Solaris officer...
I can't turn my back on
my unit, the mission..."

Fei
"Why did you have to use
the 'Drive'?"

Elly
"I didn't want to...
When I use it, I change.
I feel like I'm dominated
by some unknown power
that I never wanted...
There's a power in me I
don't want to admit.
But...I want to
protect my allies...
So, I had no choice but to
use...the 'Drive'."

Fei
"...Elly, you're
the same as me."

Elly
"The same?
...Probably.
I felt I knew you ever
since I first met you...
Probably because our
problems were so similar."

Fei
"I'm here for you.
It may not be much,
but at least I can
relate to how you
feel, Elly."

Elly
"What?
Are you saying we lick
each other's wounds?"

Fei
"No, that's not...
Well, I guess I am...
Sorry..."

Elly
"...I'm sorry.
I'm not being fair,
am I...?"

Fei
"No, I'm just
pessimistic
sometimes.
But...even so, it's
better than worrying
about it by yourself."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"You won't change
your mind...?"

Elly
"Please, don't look so
sad. I have no choice.
It is my only home..."

Fei
"...I have to go.
My 'friends' are
waiting for me."

Fei
"If you can, get out
of the army, Elly...
That look doesn't
suit you at all."

Hah...we destroyed them!
Well, we've done our job!
I hope the others do OK!"

Maitreya
"Nothing.
They say no news is
good news I guess.
My Gear doesn't have

They probably did fine
though."

Engineer
"The main engine and effect-
fins' oscillators are mostly
unharmed...

connections between them
are wasted.
We are bypassing the main
connection and trying to
scrape together all the 
energy we can.
But it will only give us
70% of our usual maximum
power at best.
The propulsion-drills are
not damaged, but if the
sand can't be granulated
they might as well be.
We'll make battle speed 3

Sigurd
"He's been quiet since the

All personnel to battle

is planned after the
connectors are up."

Bart
"Sig! Listen!
Surrendering isn't going to
change Nisan's fate.
We'll lose the Yggdrasil,
the core of our power in
saving Aveh and Margie.
I know it looks bad, but
you can still count on us!"

Bart
"Sorry, Old Maison,
I'm not dying today!!
Besides they don't look
like they're gonna hit us."

Bart
"That's probably it, Sig!
But they're forgetting one
thing...
It's harder to bring in an
animal alive than dead!"

Bart
"Thanks!!
Alright let's...
go get those fools!!"

"W, what happened?"

Fei
"I don't have a permission
slip. But I'm the Battling
Champion. Does that help?"

Fei
"Puff, puff! ...Damn!
Boy is that guy quick at
running away!"

Fei
"Puff, puff...
Around here should be 
safe enough I guess..."

Fei
"...A fiance?
With no hair...? Hmm. Where
have I heard that before?"

Citan
"The meeting place was the
'Wildcat', a bar in the 
civilian area, was it not?
Well then, let us go!"

Try knocking...

Locked from the inside!

My big sister has her heart
set on a someone...
She thinks he'll come back
one day... so she keeps
waiting and waiting and...

Children should play outside
for their own health. That's
common thinking... right!?
But in this town, covered in
dirty steam, it's probably
not that good for us...

You know, my big sister has
a friend called a 'fiance'!
He didn't have any hair,
but he was sooo kind!

Our house is just over there!

We have gathered together a
selection of many types of
accessories to protect you
from all sorts of damage!

Accessories not only make you
look better, but some of them
also have wonderous effects.
I recommend you check them out!

From Aqua to Omega, we have
all the best items. You can't
leave home without our tents
that totally restore you!

This city's other name is
"the town of steam" because
steam is being blown out of
everywhere the eye can see.
Due to this, whenever you go
out of your house you come
back pitch black all over!
It also roughens your skin!

So why am I outside then?
You shouldn't be so picky
about such little details!
I have my reasons!

Big Joe
"What's the problem? It's
much further in from there.
...Hurry up, now!"

Big Joe
"Did you change your mind?"
    No way!
    Well, alright.

Big Joe
"...C'mon, stop the joshing.
If you change your mind at
any time... well you know!

Big Joe
"Hee-hee! There's something
really interesting beyond
here! Do you want a look?"

Big Joe
"I sure swindled you!
Hah-haaa! See you
around, sucker! Adios!

Big Joe
"Only 5000G! Cheap, huh?"
    No deal!
    It's a deal!

Big Joe
"Now then boy, you're not 
making fun of me, are you?"

Handed over 5000G.

Big Joe
"...Transaction approved!
The fun starts from here!
Never fear, I'll be here!"

Big Joe
"...Wha, huh! I can't do
any business with guys who 
haven't got 5000G! So-rry!"

They say the world's a big
place, but there's no other
town nearly as big as our
capital city, anywhere!
They say there's an even
bigger city in the skies
above, but I ask you, who's
ever seen a floating city?

The attack by our enemy
kingdom Aveh on our Imperial
capital was really scary!
If that ever happens again,
I'm out of here! Perhaps I
might move to Nisan!

To the northwest of here is
the Imperial capital's D 
Block, which is used as the
criminal detention area.
It's a dirty place full of
criminals! You can come and
go freely through here, but
nobody would ever go there
out of free will or for fun!

They say that flying battleship
crashed in the north-western
area of D Block...
Luckily we escaped a direct hit.
Boy am I thankful it wasn't
near our civilian area!

Oooh... Diana... During the
assault on our capital...
by Aveh... she tried to 
save a child...
...Is there no god looking
over our world? ...Why? ...
And a woman like her! ...Is
this the fate god chose?

And I never got to...
tell her that...

Diana has gone back to look
after D Block...I'd like to
have her fix my ills, but I'm
too scared to go to D Block!
But after being assigned to
the civilian area she lost
her cheer a little...Perhaps
going back was best for her!

O.K., now to injure myself!
(But try not to let it hurt
too much!) And then...
it's off to see Diana!

What's with you, huh?
I'm just passing by...O.K.
So don't bother me. See ya!

My leg's hurt from running
around in circles all day!
I tell you, pushing yourself
too much isn't good for you!

Because of the long balance
in power, I let myself get
out of shape...
So now I am trying to build
up my physique by running 
around in circles.

But 
...it feels a little futile.

Using Aveh's raid on our
Imperial capital as a pretext,
they are going to start yet
another massive war effort!
When did this all start?
We have been at war for so 
long that we've forgotten
what we are fighting over...
Will there ever be an end
to all this fighting?

I have to ask you to turn
round and go back!"

is dangerous. I can not let
you leave now!"

"Egads...!"

Imperial City Guard
"D, didn't I tell
you that..."

Imperial City Guard
"You're the Battling Champ!?
Beyond here you'll leave the
safety of the Imperial
capital and enter regions
where monsters roam!
Perhaps you don't need me
to tell you this, but
please do take care!"

Imperial City Guard
"...? I guess I'm 
imagining things...
Anyway, welcome to Nortune,
the Kislev Imperial capital.
Greetings and salutations!

Imperial City Guard
"Oh, our reputation..."

Imperial City Guard
"Nortune, our Empire's
capital, is a powerful
military state.
Bledavik, the capital
of the Kingdom of Aveh,
is at war against us."

Imperial City Guard
"...That's strange? Haven't
I seen you somewhere before?
Hmm, I must have the wrong 
person...errh, sorry."

Imperial City Guard
"Because martial law has
been imposed throughout the
whole Imperial capital area,
civilians can only pass in 
and out the 'front gate'...
There are also rumors about
convicts, who attempted to
escape by taking advantage
of the confusion during
Aveh's raid on our capital,
hiding out in these parts.

Imperial City Guard
"Hmm...? Don't I know you 
from somewhere...?
Oh well, guess not.
Anyway, that's the way it
is, so please cooperate.

Imperial City Guard
"Sorry, but after sunset
nobody can pass through here!
That goes for Battling
Champions as well!"

Imperial City Guard
"This is the Kislev Imperial
capital barracks.
Entrance without permission
is prohib...
Hey aren't you the Battling
Champion? Permission?
Why, you don't need that!
You're the Champ!"

Imperial City Guard
"Well then, please do enter."

Imperial City Guard
"The head-cook told us off.
I'd like to let you enter,
but for a while the barracks
are off limits!"

Big Joe
"Wait up, already will ya!
Stop the hurrying, O.K.!"

Big Joe
"Oooh, wait a moment!"

chance would mere guards

He's the ex-Battling Champ!"

Imperial City Guard
"Let sleeping dogs lie, huh!"

Imperial City Guard
"Exactly! So even if we were
to see him here, then we'd 
just pretend that we haven't
seen him, O.K.!"

"Hey, that guy! He's the
ex-Champ who broke out of
the arena with his Gear
and is now 'wanted'!"

"Damn! We're done for!"

Let's try running away
for the time being!"

Fei
"We've got to give it a try!
Doc! Elly! Let's try and
force our way through here!"

Citan
"... So it is the only
thing we can do, right?"

Elly
"Wait a second!
Do you really intend
to do this?"

Imperial City Guard
"Oh no! They're serious!"

Imperial City Guard
"There's no way we can
beat the Champion!!!"

Imperial City Guard
"Hahaa! You'll be our
greatest achievement!"

Fei
"Hey, you're...Rico!
What are you doing here?"

Rico
"...I changed my mind. I'll
leave Nortune for a while,
until things calm down.
You plan on seizing the new
mega-battleship 'Goliath'?
Well, I'll give you a hand
...up to the city limits."

Fei
"...
You don't want to fight
together with us?"

Rico
"...Make no mistake here!
I don't intend to become
friends with you guys!"

Rico
"I have something I have 
to do and I have to do it
on my own...!
When we leave the Imperial
capital's precincts, you 
can let me out anywhere
that is convenient, O.K.!"

Fei
"........."

Citan
"Well, at least until we
escape from the city area
we have got a secure ally.
That is good enough for us,
is it not!"

Citan
"Don't you think?"

Elly
"Well... yes...
I suppose so."

Rico
"We have no time to 
dawdle around here!
We better get out of here
before other guards who
heard this scuffle come
causing us trouble!"

Rico
"So our destination is the
'north lands' of the outer
Imperial city area, right!
Then the Kislev Imperial
capital's military
facilities await us!
We had better make haste!"

Fei
"Something interesting...?"
    No thanks, I'll pass.
    I want to take a look!

Big Joe
"What a party-pooper!"

Big Joe
"Oh! So you do want to go
take a look, huh? ...
Well, young man, if all in
this world was that easy,
huh? You know, I can't just
let you go see for free!
So...
let's make a deal then boy!
I'm talking money, friend!
Cash, mullah, wampum, G!
If I was just to get out of
your way and leave... well,
it would benefit you, but...
it'd be of no profit to me!
If I gain, you gain!
That's the way it goes!
It's a fair trade, is it 
not, friend?"

Big Joe
"It's a bargain at 5000G!"
    No deal!
    It's a deal!

Big Joe
"Hey, you allowed me to
tell you this much, then
say no! That's not nice!

Handed over 5000G.

Big Joe
"...Transaction approved!
The fun starts from here!
Never fear, I'll be here!"

Big Joe
"...Wha, huh! I can't do
any business with guys who 
haven't got 5000G! So-rry!"

Fei
"Ah! Hey, wait!!"

Hammer
"Bro---! With these ears,
I've picked up the latest
information on your Gear!"

Hammer
"Hee-hee, I've pinpointed
where your Gear is bro!"

Fei
"... Hold on a second!
(Don't you think it's
dangerous to talk about
that stuff around here!)"

Hammer
"Huh?
What's with you, bro?
I have info on your Gea..."

Hammer
"Eeek!
Wha, wha, what the!?"

Citan
"I will explain later!
Just move it, O.K.!"

Hammer
"Waaaaaaiiiii----t!"

Fei
"It should be safe here.
Now Hammer, tell me where 
my Gear is."

Hammer
"As the doc predicted, bro,
your Gear has been moved to
another dispatchment dock."

Citan
"So, where on earth 
is Weltall?"

Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!
I've checked into it and 
found out that there are
two routes we can use to 
sneak inside.
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds.

Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena! What's the second?"

Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves 
the supply train tunnel.
You have to get into the
tunnel's ducts and follow
them right through till
they lead to the docks.
But I couldn't find out
the duct's layout...
Sorry, bro."

Fei
"...Oh that tunnel, huh?
Well, now that we have the
bomb problem off of our
necks, we might be able to
make a go of it!"

Citan
"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing the times
that the trains pass by on.
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"

Fei
"Not all of this has to be
decided now. Let's take our
time and plan it carefully!"

Fei
"Firstly Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but...
Could you find out the days
and times that the supply
trains operate on for us
please?"

Hammer
"I'll get right on it, bro.
Well then, I'll be off!"

Citan
"Shall we also return
to D Block for the 
time being?"

Citan
"Well, Fei.
The train will be here
soon. Let us hurry, up to
the observation tower."

Fei
"Jump onto the train from
here when it goes by..."

Fei
"...That's right.
First we have to clear up
this murder case..."

Fei
"That's right, sorry doc.
I completely forgot.
I'll have to go back to
the dorm..."

Fei
"Thanks.
I'm gonna go now then."

...It's gone.

Citan
"...It is gone."

Alarm activated, please leave

Upper passage thermal motion

No good, it's locked.

It's locked from the inside.

Gramps
"I've some advice for you,
youngster!
Jumping from this tower is
illegal!! Even if I know you
I'm gonna fine you!
Better not forget it!
I'm no pushover!"

Gramps
"Hey, today the supply train
is coming through!
I've some advice for you,
youngster, don't try to
block the tracks!
You'll be fined..."

Gramps
"Beyond those tracks over
there...
There's some special
equipment in the tunnel.
There was a group who tried
to escape and didn't know
that. That bomb collar
went BOOM! Yep, see ya..."

Gramps
"...As long as you have
that bomb collar on, it's
impossible to escape!"

Gramps
"I've some advice for you,
youngster! Jumping from
this tower is illegal!!
Even if I know you you,
I'm gonna fine you!
Better not forget it!
I'm no pushover!"

Gramps
"What! Youngster!!
Weren't you listening?
You can't jump from here! 
It's illegal!"

Gramps
"Hey, the fine's 50G!
You can't jump from here,
I'll teach you a lesson."

Got a 50G fine!

Gramps
"You don't have 50G?
Youngster, having trouble...
Go on! Get outta here!"

Anyway, got 30G!!

I don't have much strength,
but I know I won't lose to
anyone in the manual
dexterity department!
So I'm doing the perfect job
for me, fixing the roof.
It pays almost as well as
working the sewers!

Hey, hey, I have some
advice for you. That old
guy in the observation
tower, he's real strict.
If you look like you're
gonna jump you're out.
Don't even try and jump
from the tower!

By the way, 
I have a good story.
I know where you can get a
job without having to look
for it. Here, the price for
cleaning up monsters is set.
Any other job sucks.
...So if you really
need to go down there,
gimme some money and I'll
let you.

How about just 100G?
     I'll pass
     Guess I have to...

Wha! I see.
Well fine, be that way!

Handed over 100G.

Hey, business is better.
Hurry, down in the sewer!
If I get caught...

Some advice for ya bud.
Don't go too far alone!
The further you the
stronger the monsters are.

Hey you, wait a sec,
Did ya bring the 100G?
If ya don't pay I won't
let ya out!

This is the entrance to the
Kislev sewers. There's a ton
of monsters down there so
don't go unless you're good.
Those stupid Battlers and
bounty hunters are always
coming and going.

Hey, hold on!

You, didn't you hear me?
The sewer is closed off by
martial order. You got it?
So no more cleaning up.
You'll have to find another
way to make money.

Hey, what...the?
Y...You're the
Ch, Champ!!

Rico
"Thanks for watching the
sewers. I'm going down
there now...
Don't let anyone besides
these guys in."

Yes sir, Champ!!

Sometimes posters have
comments written on
them...
I don't know if it'll help
but you'd better take a
look...

I'll tell you one thing.
Things posted up on walls,
like that, on that wall...
They have some stuff written
on them. There are lots
more than that one too.

Pay attention!

The crowd in the bar never
changes. But the upper level
of the prisoners' dorm is
full of Battlers.

This isn't like a bar. The
dorm is full of people
coming and going,
it's ever changing.

Even in this smoggy town,
if you take special care
and water the plants,
flowers will bloom.

Gave Dog Food!

Just a dog house......

Fei
"...Getting up's a pain."

Above the cross, a goat's horn, 
east and west, 
the ruling god's throne,
the one possessing, the red seal,
here and there,
digging up, 
treasures of the past,
or so...they say.

That's the song I wrote.
It's about the B-Info. store.
We sell machine parts for
Gears from ruins all over
the world.

I know a lot, huh?

Hey hey, Eric......!?
...not.
Gimme some money!

Cool!

This is such a dangerous
town! They even steal the
shirt off your back.
But since he's my bodyguard
it's no problem!

Wonder if anythings on the
ground?
Yeah, c'mon.
Wanna help?

Whoo whoo.

Well...the coin
design disappeared...
But like I thought, the
coin got bigger.

See,  isn't this coin
worthless...?
Ahhh, I thought it'd work.

You'll waste the coin,
don't do it!

Hmmm, according to
my theory the coin should
get bigger...
So, it'll be worth more!

My Adaman coin is messed
up now because of those
experiments!
And the fine detail is
all gone...
Sigh...
It was better before!

There are rails here.
Occasionaly a train comes
through here!...So
I put a coin here as a test.

      -WARNING-
This is dangerous, do
not try this at home!

Shut up, I can see that.
I snuck in from the duct...not.
I was repairing the duct.
Maybe it'd be better if
you'd just settle down
and get to work?
Not sewer cleaning but...

Guard
"I have the night watch!

Guard
"You can pass!!"

Guard
"From prisoner to Battler.
Well good luck..."

Guard
"Hmm, so you're the new guy?
The Imperial Committee is
looking for you...
They heard something about
you and the Champ's men...
They should still be
somewhere in D Block.
They decided to visit you...
This is a good chance for a
prisoner like yourself!"

Guard
"You again? The Committee
member is still waiting
in the dorm or the bar.
Hurry, now!"

Guard
"This is your one in a
million chance to show
your stuff!!
The dorm or the bar...
hurry!"

Guard
"This is the main town.
D Block prisoners like
yourself can't pass."

Guard
"Hey, you...huh?
Oh it's you!
I heard from the Imperial
Battling Committee...
I can let you thru, but as
long as you have that bomb
collar on it's no use
trying to escape...!
If you don't wanna die,
stay away from the off-
limit areas, such as the
civilian section, okay!?"

Guard
"This is the main town.
D Block prisoners like you,
what? You're...?
...Excuse me!
Please go on through."

Guard
"Crap, the Champ losing was
unbelieveable...
it was like 20 to 5. Almost
everyone bet on the Champ...
...Me, I'm
I bet a half years salary,
all of iteverything...
stupid...
...Guess I'll be working
in the sewers too."

Guard
"We haven't had too many
Rank A prisnoers like you.
That's why the Committee
noticed you.
This years match, it's
expected...
the Champ will win though."

Guard
"...You lost to Suzarn and
you're only Rank B so there
is no reason for the
committee to notice you..."

Guard
"Next time you'll fight
while piloting a big machine
called a Gear. Good luck and
don't get yourself killed."

Guard
"Are those Imperial
capital Committee
guys losing it?
 
They're waiting around
just to talk to a Rank C
prisoner about entering
the Battling...?"

Guard
"Hey. it's a once in a life
time chance. You gotta give
it a try......"

Guard
"Are those Imperial
capital Committee
guys losing it?
They're waiting around
just to talk to a Rank C
prisoner about entering
the Battling...?"

Guard
"Hey. it's a once in a life
time chance. You gotta give
it a try......"

Guard
"It's unbelievable!
The Imperial Committee
is talking to a Rank D
prisoner about entering
the Battling.
What are they thinking?"

Guard
"There are no prisoners
locked up in here like you,
who became a Battler in
such a short time.
Hahaha, won't be able to
take my eyes off the match
this year...
Well, good luck.
I'll be rooting for you,
I guess."

Guard
"What work?
I've only got one job.
...But I know there are
lots of monsters down in
Kislev's sewers.
Cleaning them up is a job."

Guard
"Hey, you!
Whaddya just walking around
in circles for? You're a
prisoner, work like one!"

Guard
"Don't go near that dog.
He'll bark a lot and I
can't stand it.
Wanna buy some dog food?
Give it to him and he'll
be quiet."
    Don't need it
    I'll take it

Guard
"I'll give you a deal.
But, if you use it
there's no more.
You understand that?"

Guard
"Okay, it'll be 5G."

Guard
"Haha...
Here you go..."

Received Dog Food!

Guard
"You don't have 5G?
Are you a pauper...?"

Guard
"Hahaha. 
That kid's, at it again.
Do you know the kid's story?
If he squishes that coin
it'll be worthless.
Well, ignorance is bliss......
Besides, he's never been
successful. Gramps always
gets mad at him.
Happens every time..."

Guard
"...You're amazing.
Taking out the sewer
monster, the Battling 
Champ...
Compared to that I'm
just...
I'll always be just guard
captain. How'd you get like
that?Quit your regular
job and start Battling?"

Guard
"...I guess you hafta do it.
But, it's impossible for me.
I'm not that type...sigh..."

Guard
"...Sigh...
I've had enough of D Block.
I wanna be transferred to
the main city.
...I mean, as long as you
prisoners have those bomb
collars, escape is
impossible.
That's not too much to ask."

Guard
"Before,the guy who was
the guard captain left to be
a Battler. That's how I
became captain..."

Guard
"Reality, it's a pain.
...Sigh..."

Fei
"Whoa!!
What the?"

Citan
"Please wait a moment!
Did he say he would be
waiting at the dormitory?"

Rico
"Wait, Fei.
Until the Battling
thing is settled."

Fei
"Who are you?"

Battler
"Don't be so cruel.
We've been waiting for you."

Citan
"Waiting?
For......us?"

Battler
"Please,
come with us..."

Fei
"...This isn't going to
be another stupid 'Baptism
Ceremony' is it?"

Amazoness
"Hey, hey,
wait a minute!"

Amazoness
"We're not trying to pick a
fight. Keep talking like
that and there's bound to be
a misunderstanding.
Leave this to me..."

Battler
"Right, sorry."

Citan
"...Well, I assume
you are not hostile..."

Fei
"..."

Amazoness
"...Not here.
Let's go somewhere else.
Come, follow me."

Citan
"It seems we have
no choice.
Shall we go Fei?"

Citan
"Please wait a moment!
Did he say he would be
waiting at the dormitory?"

"This is the meeting place?

Well, let us we go
to the arena."

"That's right, sorry doc,
I completely forgot.
I'll have to go back to

"S...sir!
Aww shoot..."

Fei
"...Sorry, doc.
This is the sewer entrance."

Fei
"Hey, doc...
what should I do?"

"The plan was a failure...
I see. Since we cannot
turn back time..."

day, I was gonna play a
trick on him..."

you like...

lolly gag around."

fixed yet..."

that's the way it is!!"

"Jeez, you don't have
to get so mad.
I didn't know.
So hey, tell me something,
what is this?"

"...Might as well.
It's the Observation
Tower."

I'm the operations manager.

manage.
It's perfectly automated.
I'm only the operations
manager on paper."

"Perfect?
Is anything in the world
perfect...?"

The only weakness is the
detection equipment...
If it detects a heat source
it'll shut the whole thing

Maybe...we can meet again."

Amazoness
"Hey, it's almost here.
There's no time to talk."

Battler
"Sorry, I was so worried
about the Champ I couldn't
leave.
Rico's counting on you."

Citan
"Again...!
Fei, hurry,
jump off!!"

Citan
"Whew, that was a close
one! We almost got thrown
off."

Fei
"It's all because of
those mischievous punks!
When the old man's gone
they always do this.
Oh well."

Citan
"Kind of odd hearing that
from a mischievous 'you
know who'."

Fei
"Huh? You say 
something?"

Citan
"Well, anyway we should
be alright if we take
this all the way.
As for the mission,
so far so good."

Fei
"What's that sound?"

Citan
"The connector...!
Fei, hurry up
and jump off!!"

Citan
"This train is almost
falling apart.
That was another close one."

Fei
"What if it derails
before we get to
the Gear dock..."

!!

Citan
"This car is unstable too.
Let us get to the front!!"

Citan
"One disaster after
another..."

Fei
"Pretty unreliable
train."

Citan
"The entrance to the
ventilation shaft
that leads to the Gear dock
should be
coming up soon."

Citan
"Here we go!!"

There it goes...

Uuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

The Kislev capital's, Nortune's
'Central Administrive District'
itself was a secret battleship
constructed by Bart's ancestor,
Roni Fatima, after the Great
War with Solaris many hundreds
of years ago.

The existence of the secret
battleship remained hidden.
Later, the ship was turned
into a section of the Kislev
Imperial capital during the
founding of the Empire.

Uncovering this truth from some
ancient records, Bart activated
the secret battleship in order
to fight against the Solarian
Mobile Surface Supremacy Weapon.

The 'Sand Cruiser Yggdrasil'
was actually the center of
command and also the main
secret weapon of the craft...
 
Awakening from 500 years
of dormancy, its true
form appeared before us.
 
Commanded by its 'new master',
the secret battleship stood
before the Mobile Weapon with
all of us inside of it.

Big Joe
"Hey, brother, you!
You wanna listen to
my super muchacho
information?"

Fei
"...Super nacho
information?
What's so interesting
about nachos?"

Big Joe
"...From the looks of it,
you're all in a group,
right?
In that case, you need to
change your party! If you
go to the 'Wildcat' pub,
there'll be a new waitress.
If you ever want to change
your party members, just
remember to stop by there."

Big Joe
"Hey, brother, you!
You want to hear about my
super muchacho
information?"

Fei
"H, hey!? You're the one
who stole my '5000G'.
Give it back to me now."

Big Joe
"...Hey hey.
That's just a minor thing.
Being picky will only turn
you into a boring adult.
You gotta be...?
How would you say...
more open and deep like
the sea.
Well, setting that aside,
you need to listen to my
super muchacho
information!"

Fei
"...You're funny. But
keep it up an' you'll
just piss me off."

Big Joe
"...From the looks of it,
you're all in a group,
right?
In that case, you need to
change your party! If you
go to the 'Wildcat' pub,
there'll be a new waitress.
If you ever want to change
your party members, just
remember to stop by there."

Big Joe
"Oh, one more thing...
There was a deep deep
reason, as deep as the
deepest ocean, for doing
what I did. As a way of
making up for it, go back
to that backstreet one
more time and search the
area... You just might
find something good, for
real!"

purpose in doing this!
I have nothing to do
with you!"

Fei
"..."

Suzarn
"R...ridiculous... Even
I lost to you..."

Suzarn
"Although he was able to
defeat the other three...
He was no match for me."

Suzarn
"Champ, what shall
we do with him?"

Vargas
"Hah! I'll get you
for this someday."

Vargas
"Heinrich and Leonardo
are pitiful to have lost
to the likes of 'im..."

Heinrich

I have..."

Heinrich
"Hahaha. We'll talk again
when you can beat me."

Leonardo

someone who's just
recovered...Sadness."

Leonardo
"Hunh! No no!! You ain't
got the basics, the
basics."

Rico
"Kid, you're up front."

Rico
"Now, I think you've got
the idea, but I'll tell
you anyway...
All the criminals sent here
are each given a rank.
Deciding what rank you are
is easy...
You get your rank by
fighting these four
Battlers."

Rico
"Relax, the fights are
one on one.
By now you should've
realized...
Results are everything!
If you can defeat these
four Battlers, you'll be
promised a certain amount
of freedom..."

Rico
"Then, let the fights
begin..."

Rico
"Your first opponent
will be Leonardo."

Rico
"Hmph.
How's the next one?"

Rico
"That wasn't even a
match...
Your rank is D!!"

Rico
"Hmmm, entertaining.
How's the next one?"

Rico
"Is that all...?
Your rank is C!!"

Rico
"Not bad. No one's
defeated Vargas since
Suzarn...
Now for the last one!
You think you can win?"

Rico
"That's about right...
Your rank is C!!"

Rico
"You've defeated all 4...
Hah, this is an
unexpected outcome.
Let me give you the
special treatment. I,
myself, will be your
final opponent."

Rico
"Too bad...
Your rank is B!!"

Rico
"No need for a reason.
This is the D Block
tradition! We must
determine the pecking
order."

Rico
"Get ready!"

Rico
"What's wrong? If you
don't resist, I'll end
up breakin' yer neck!"

Rico
"Hm? What's that?
I can't hear you!"

Rico
"Hmph. Well then,
this is the end!"

Rico
"What!?"

Rico
"Hah hah hah.
That's more like it...
You're quite good.
You're the first one to
ever injure me.
Now I don't have to
hold back.
I'm looking forward to
this!"

Fei

gah..."

Well, a win is a win. 
Your rank is A."

Rico
"...Didn't you hear?
Take him back to
his quarters."

Rico
"...And don't forget that
one thing..."

Rico
"That's what I'd like to
say...but even we have
some compassion.
We'll give you some time...
Even though it's one on
one, you still have to
fight all four.
You should get prepared
for the battle.
And one more thing...
Don't even think about
trying to get away from
here... After all,
that's an impossibility."

Suzarn
"Hey, are you ready?"
    Hang on
    Let's rock

Suzarn

Aside from myself, the
rest of the gang doesn't

Fei
"Looks like Hammer's
here."

Oh, yes. Next time,
please knock! Then I will
open the door for you.
If you come through the
toilet............
ya...you know! It might
be at the wrong time.

Fei
"......Uh, yeah. You're
right... I understand.
And, how many knocks?"

Hmmm, let's say......
'2, 1, 2'... Would 
that be okay?

Fei
"Got it.
2, 1, 2... right?"

Uh huh, yes.
Well then, good luck.

I too had been thinking of
leaving from the Imperial
capital...
But then I came to think
that if I try harder things
will get better......
You too try your hardest, OK!

How's it going, good?

Hey, wait a minute!
Where did you......

Uh, huh?
You're the one from
D Block......

You're all just
like my daughter.
She just won't give up.
So many people.
It must be hard
for you to get around.
Do you want to change here?
    No
    Change party

......Okay.
By the way, did you go
meet my daughter working
in D Block? If you
haven't, by all means,
please go see her.

I see, a lot has
happened. No wonder they
imposed martial law.
Please tell her, 
and you too......good luck.

You know, she's keeping
that promise she made
with you...... She's in
D Block, so don't forget
to go see her once in a
while.

Hang in there.

Oh my, a customer?
......Wait? I thought I
locked the door?

...How did you
all get in here?
You didn't come
in through the chimney
in the bathroom did you?

......Oh, it's you
guys. You guys survived
the Aveh air assault...
......Wha?......Daughter?
...Diana. In the air
assault she... sob, sob.
...She shielded us from
the......

She was just starting
out with life... Instead,
she saved a old-timer
like me...How could I...
god...forgive me...
Your presence here today
reminds me of her too
much...

After the assault, I moved
away for a while, but this
is still the city my
daughter was born in.
I too will live out the
rest of my life here.
Together with her...
in memory of Diana...

In my house, my sister
...sleeps. She re-kindled
my spirits. My sister...
is home now. My
sist...sob...

Hammer
"...Use the key like...
Oh!? Wh, what
happened, bro?
Did you forget where the
base is? 
Sigh, fine then.
The military facility is to
'the north of the capital'
'beyond the carved out part
of the mountain range'.
You're all set now!"

Hammer
"I gave away all my items
to the people who were
injured by the Aveh attack.
I, I didn't take any money
for it though!
I woulda never done that
before...
Who'd have thought I could
do such a thing?
...Heh. It's probably
because of you, bro."

Hammer
"Bro, you wanna buy
something? ...
Just kidding. I'm all
outta items."

Fei
"...I went to D Block,
but they wouldn't let the
public in 'cause of the
martial law."

Fei
"...This door was to the
toilet right?
...It's okay, don't
worry!"

Elly
"Fei, that's the...
Oh...nevermind.
Nothing..."

Fei
"Elly, your face is red."

Fei
"It's... n, nothing!
Let's hurry up and go,
Fei!!"

Citan
"Fei, that is the toilet.
The exit is that way,
unless...you cannot hold
it?"

Fei
"........."

Citan
"I am just kidding."

Hammer
"Oh, yes!
I forgot to tell you
about Master Rico, bro."

Fei
"You've seen him?"

Hammer
"Yeah, and I brought up
our plan to escape from
the capital... Says he
can't help us though."

Fei
"...I see."

Citan
"Fei, he has his own path
he must take. Now...
let us go."

Elly
"...Fei, we must hurry to
Aveh..."

Fei
"Huh? Uh yeah...I know,
Elly. We have to hurry...
If we go through the
front gate we might have
to fight the guards...
Hammer, once we break
through, fall in behind
us."

Hammer
"That's my specialty.
Leave it to me, bro.
And put up a good fight!"

Fei
"Doc, Elly.
Let's go. Our destination
is the imperial military
facility up north."

Hammer
"Ju, just a minute!
There's something I have
to tell Elly."

Elly
"Tell
...me?"

Hammer
"Yes'm!
It'll be real quick."

Hammer
"All right!"

Citan
"...All right?"

Hammer
"Uh, nothing!!"

Hammer
"Good luck in breaking
through the front gate,
bro, and you Citan!"

Fei
"...First we save the
empire, now we're being
chased by them"

Citan
"We cannot make a wrong
move with security
this tight..."

Fei
"Hammer's our only
hope...He's awfully late
though."

Elly
"...There's no one here."

Fei
"Where did the owner of
the house go without
locking up the place?"

Citan
"The furnishings are
untouched...
They probably left when
Aveh attacked."

Elly
"..."

Hammer
"Bro, Citan!
I got the key info that
should help us get outta
the capital!"

Fei
"So what's the info?"

Hammer
"The empire's new
super airship,
...'Goliath'.
This is it, bro."

Citan
"The empire's new
creation...the super
airship 'Goliath'?"

Elly
"...Super airship.
Is it that big?"

Hammer
"Tsk tsk, it's
beyond big!
!?..."

Elly
"...It's Elly."

Hammer
"!? ...As I said, it's
beyond big, Elly!"

Hammer
"The 'Goliath' is of
extraordinary magnitude!
It's said that the
'Goliath' can even make
a Gear look like a pea.
It's rumored that it
can even decimate the
Aveh capital, Bledavik,
all by itself."

Fei
"By itself, annihilate
Aveh!? It must be a
monstrous battleship."

Hammer
"According to my reliable
sources, it's located
north of Kislev in an
underground dock at some
military facility..."

!?

Elly
"...The military
facility... north of the
capital..."

Fei
"Elly, what's wrong?"

Elly
"I know that facility.
I've talked to you about
it before. The Imperial
facility... 
I infiltrated...I never knew
that something like that
was in the basement..."

Citan
"...Elly, do you think
you still remember...
how you infiltrated
the base?"

Elly
"Yes, Citan."

Elly
"Way north, beyond the
Kislev Imperial capital...
beyond the 'carved out
portion of the mountain 
peak' lies the Imperial
city's military facility."

Fei
"Good, let's take that...
...before the empire
decides to launch a
counter-attack against
Aveh."

Fei
"...?
Do you know me?

Citan
"Fei, you did not...
with this woman while
I was gone?"

Fei
"Wa, wait a minute,
doc!? I didn't do..."

Heh, haha.
You probably can't tell
by the way I'm dressed.

Fei
"???"

Come on, it's me, the
doctor from D Block.
Don't you remember?"

Fei
"...!? You, the one from
D Block!"

Yeah, now you remember.
Long time no see. Oh,
you got that collar off?

Citan
"Yes, he became the
Battling Champ.
He is no longer a
prisoner."

Then you're the Battling
Champ? Wow! That's great!
I knew you were strong.

And you might be?

Citan
"Oh, excuse me, we have
never met.
I am Citan Uzuki. 
You could say that I 
am his guardian."

Fei
"G, guardian...?"

Citan
"Presently, I am the
doctor in the imperial
D Block..."

!?

Hold on!! Why is the
D Block doctor here?

Citan
"Huh? Uh, well...
that is..."

Sigh, what's going to
happen if someone gets
injured now!? Who's going
to look at the injury?
Don't you feel an
obligation as a doctor
to...Dr. Uzuki, don't
you have any
responsibility!?

Citan
"I, I am extremely
sorry."

Fei
"...Uhmm, mind if I
interrupt?"

What?

Fei
"You're the doctor in
charge here?
That's what I heard from
Hammer."

Aaahh, that.
Following the request of
the empire, I agreed to
be in charge of this part
of the city, but now
they're telling me they
already have enough
doctors...

Who do they think they
are? So, for now, I'm
just on standby. As long
as nothing really big
happens, I think I'm
going to be here for
quite a while...

Fei
"...I know I'm in no
position to ask you, but
do you think you could
return to D Block?"

Isn't Dr. Uzuki in
charge of D Block?
I can't just do that.

Fei
"Well it's about that.
...We're leaving the
capital soon.
Of course
doc will be with us.
So...it would be good if
you could take care of
D Block."

I see you've got your
own problems... Okay,
leave D Block to me. And
also, if you have any
other problems, come to
me. I'll try to help in
any way I can."

Fei
"Thanks, I owe you one."

Citan
"I am sorry about this.
Please take care of
everyone."

Fei
"Sorry 'bout this.
There was nowhere else
we could talk about
it..."

No, it's okay.
I haven't been able to
see Hammer in a while.

Hammer
"Sis, you didn't forget
about me. I'm so
t, touched!"

Fei
"Alright, Hammer.
So tell me where
my Gear is."

Hammer
"Huh? Oh!?
Yeah, the Gear.
I almost forgot."

Hammer
"As the doc predicted, bro.
Your Gear has been moved to
another dispatchment dock."

Citan
"So, where on earth 
is Weltall?"

Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!
I've checked into it and 
found out that there are
two routes we can use to 
sneak inside.
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds.

Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena! What's the second?"

Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves 
the supply train tunnel.
You have to get into the
tunnel's ducts and follow
them right through till
they lead to the docks.
But I couldn't find out
the duct's layout...
Sorry, bro."

Fei
"...Oh that tunnel, huh?
Well, now that we have the
bomb problem off of our
necks, we might be able to
make a go of it!"

Citan
"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing the times
that the trains pass by on.
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"

Fei
"Not all of this has to be
decided now. Let's take our
time and plan it carefully!"

Fei
"Firstly Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but...
Could you find out the days
and times that the supply
trains operate on for us
please?"

Hammer
"I'll get right on it, bro.
Well then, I'll be off!"

Citan
"Shall we return to
D Block for now?"

Kislev Capital - 1010
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A reactor that cannot be
controlled by man is just
like a double-edged sword.
We will hurt even ourselves.

In the northern part of the
capital, in the industrial
block lies a relic from an
ancient civilization...
a giant 'reactor'.
That reactor produces power
beyond our ability to control.
It's something man will
never be able to wield...

It's become apparent that the
primary target in the attack
on the Empire was to bomb that
reactor in the industrial block.
If they had a direct hit on the
reactor...the entire capital
would've been turned to ashes.
It would've been a hell on
earth where no living thing
could exist."

There's been some
information that
suggests Aveh is doing
something suspicious.
This balance we've 
had with them isn't
going to last...

During the assault on the
Empire, it was said that
the new imperial Gear was
stolen from the D Block
area Gear dock...
According to the higher
ups, I accidentally heard
that it was the same Gear
that was stolen by that
commando unit.

Just a while ago I was
pretty active in the
Battling tournament.
Then those people from the
committee scouted me out.
Heh, it's good to be a
soldier.

My Gear was primarily
customized for ground
combat and they used
that to assign me to
the rescue unit.
Although I wasn't able
to fight in my Gear,
it's a pretty good
feeling knowing my job
is saving people.

For today's lecture we will
discuss the movement of
Gears on the world map.
I understand that most of
you are ex-Battlers and are
well acquainted with Gears,
but it should be no loss for
you to re-learn the basics.
First, the limits to the
area of movement of Gears...
It is impossible to walk
through dense forests in
a Gear!
Instead of being hasty, just
press the L2 and R2 buttons
simultaneously and you will
all get off your Gears.
Once you pass through the
forest, you may once again
get on your Gears! That is
all for this lecture...
Any questions?

...If there are no
questions, class is
dismissed. Oh yes, I
forgot one thing...
This is common sense,
but movement over
water is not possible.

Whew, it was another
wonderful lecture today.
I'm even awed at myself.
...I'm sure looking
forward to tomorrow's 
lecture.

Hmm, I noticed you were all
diligently listening to my
lecture.
Now don't forget, getting
on and off your Gears is
done by pressing the L2 and
R2 buttons simultaneously!!

Battler Soldier
"The lecture's about to begin.
Although it's short, it's such
a bother. Please don't talk
to me right now."

Battler Soldier
"The officer's lecture is
always the same...It's
hard on us people who
have to listen to him.
Not just that, he keeps
adding to the rules,
regulations and control
of activities.
I wish I could go back to
my days as a Battler."

Amazon Soldier
"Shut up, I'm trying to
listen so quit talking
to me."

Amazon Soldier
"Argh, this sucks. He
thinks it's a lecture but
all he does is say the
same thing everyday.
Compared to this, I was
fighting a lot more in my
Battling days.
Now that was living.
Maybe I should quit the
military..."

Army Cook
"Patriotism is a necessary
component to drafting many
young soldiers.
But because of that, we get
some young ones that over do
it. By the time that happens,
it's usually too late..."

Army Cook
"I'm the cook for the
Imperial barracks.
I can get in trouble for
having you guys in here.
If you have no business
here, please leave.
Moreover, you aren't
even soldiers.
I thought that I told
them strictly not to
allow civilians in.
Man...what am I going
to do."

Argh! I failed again.
Hmmm, there's just
something not right with
the special sauce.
Ether cuisine has a lot
of depth to it.

Failure is an important
step to my path to success!
It's my dream to become
just like that first Ether
cook over in D Block.

...I volunteered so
that I could protect my
country... But this...
I didn't join for this.

I'm a new recruit for the
Kislev military. I just
graduated from the Imperial
officer school as an elite!
So, why did they put me in
A Block working under the
chief cook?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm, no matter how much
I sleep, it's not enough.
I still feel weak...
The more I sleep the more
lethargic I get.
They say sleep makes strong
children...is that true?

Uuuh, now I can't fall
asleep... I keep
thinking Aveh might attack
any minute now I can't get
to sleep...
Ahh,I hope this war
ends soon.

Now we're training
for the Kaiser Sigmund
defense parade...
and...hey, who're you?
There are a lot of high
officials in this room,
we want to impress them
and get promotions.
So beat it.

Now, start again!
Hey, out of the way!

Well,they liked me
fairly well, but
the officer pressing for
my promotion died in the
last air assault. 

That opportunity was
right in front of me.
...Life is harsh. At this
rate, they're going to
send me out to the battle
field.

Hmm, that young one
over there...
It's a shame to keep him
a private...
But, that one over there's
been sitting there all
this time. Who is he?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kislev Capital - 1014
----------------------------------------------------------------------

He's got too much pride.
It's not like we've ever
been overly proud of him.

Probably doesn't want
to lose to anyone else.
Well, it doesn't matter
to me. If you keep taking
those people seriously
everytime, it's not going
to be worth it...

Damn! Why's his rank higher
than mine, just because
he's good at Gear combat?
I'm still his senior.

...Life isn't fair.
What's so great about
Battlers!? Dammit!

Ya know, that disk is
broken. The box itself
is as good as new. All we
need is a new disk so we
can listen to it...

Pfh, ah hah hah hah!

That's the new waitress
that's supposed to start
today. She still
needs a lot of training,
so go easy on her today!

Yeah, that's how you
do it. Good.

I'm trying to work,
could you get out of the
way? By the way,
I'm tired of that kind
of stuff.

Out of the way!

Uh, excuse me. Could
you please move? You're
in the waaaay.

Hey you, you've got an
interesting disk. Lemme
see. Lemme see.

This...is a really
special type. You won't
be able to use it on any
other box except for this
one...In addition, I'm
getting some kind of
Ether response...
You think it's an Ether
coated premium disk?

Hunh? Who are youuu?
Me? I'm child of the
dragon tribe. In the
dragon tribe, when you
get older, you become
something incredible!

Of course you know
that though!

G...good afternoon.
W, welcome to the
'Wildcat'. It must be
tough travelling in such
a big group. W, would you
like to change your
organization? I'm not
used to this...sob...

Um... would you like
to change members?
    No
    Change party

H, how could you...
so...Please come
again. But...next time
please reorganize.

Th, thank you! Well
then...Master, please
handle it.

I heard there was a
title match. Man, I
could've shown off my
graceful Gear fighting
and take down the
infamous Champ but...

When I reached the
Empire, the tournament
was already over.
It seems I arrived after
the infamous Champ was 
already taken down
...oouuhh.

So... cute.
Kniqupnii. It's too much
for me!

Don't you think so?

Oooooh...too cute.

Argh...damn Aveh.
Because of that attack,
Josephine was crushed
under a chair...

You okay...Josephine?

Oooh...Alright...
alright.

After being a mercenary
for Aveh, I was going
to make money at the
Imperial Battling...
But the Battling's been
stopped for now.

...It's too bad for me.

The attack on the
Empire by Aveh is sure to
start a war...
A mercenary like me can't
make a living without
some conflict.

Kislev and Aveh...
Which one should I suck
the blood from...

If the enemy capital is called
the 'Desert Fortress'...
then our Imperial capital,
Nortune, would be the
'Fortress of Steam and Steel'.

That sounds...pretty
impressive...boss.

I was surprised by the
Aveh attack, but I was
lucky my comrad was from
the mole tribe.

I'm embarrased...
boss.

Well, what ever
happens...

Hmmm, from the looks
of it, you look like Gear
pilots. Did you hear
about some Battling done
around here from
somewhere?

I'm not too sure of
the details, but this
time it seems like they
are going run with some
kind of 'point' system. I
wonder if you can win
prizes with that?

Welcome to the 'Wildcat'.
Make yerself comfortable.
And leave the cat alone!

Maybe with this we can
listen to it?

See if it works?
    Don't
    Listen

...A jukebox. There's
only one disk...

See if it works?
    Don't
    Listen

The disk seems broken

B, boss... I, I've done
as much as I can...
This feeling in my
heart...

...Sorry, forgive me.
I've said too much...

B, boss... I, my
heart...P, pp, please
listen.

I see, this is a
surprise...It's that...
You've fallen in love
with someone haven't you?

I, I'm from mole tribe
but, I've fallen for that
dragon tribe beauty.

Can a mole love another
tribe? I...I...

...I'll permit it!!
Do whatever you have to
do.

Wh, whatever...I have
to do? Right now, I don't
think I could...

...Okay I will. We'll
take it long, slow and
imminently...right?

Yes...sir.

Please come again.

...A decent selection.
Oh yes, the accessories
are all treasures, so
buying them's no loss.
But remember, I don't work
for the store though.

All these weapons,and none
that fit me.Guns are too
dangerous,and swords are
heavy and bulky...

Sigh...isn't there a
weapon that's safe, light
and easy to use?

This is it,...
the ideal weapon.

He's travelled various
countries looking for his
ideal weapon. I'm
just a woman attracted by
his ardor... He said
he'd continue on until he
found this weapon. His
journey may never end.

We've travelled through
most of Ignas... When
will he ever look at me,
and not these weapons...?

It's my hobby to see the

it happens.

Ah hahaha, ooh sorry.

I'll open the lock for you.

When the war is over,
he'll come back... He
didn't leave because he
couldn't bear the war.
I know...he'll be back.

The war will end, grandma.
It's almost over... So
don't say 'before I die'.'

My daughter was engaged to
a man, but he left the
Empire because he couldn't
stand this long war.

This war will never end.
... Before I die, I
want to see the face of my
grandchild.

'W-a-r'. I'm not really
sure what it means, but I
think it's just beating the
enemy, right?

A portrait......
...? I've seen that face
before.

Haagh! Just when I thought
I could finally earn a
living, along comes a
humongously strong monster
in the sewers... D-oh!...

It seems that Champ beat the
monster, but that doesn't
mean it was the only one...
I don't like the idea, but
I need the money. Damn it!

Ah, should I earn my living
in the sewers?
Or should I follow my true 
calling in life?
Ooooh, I'm sooo confused!

I lost the preliminaries
of the Imperial Games, but
my prisoner ranking went
up by 1. As a result my
reward money went up too!

It makes me want to try
harder at sewer monster
extermination! Haha-!

Today's earnings are 40
'Hob-Jerky' and 10 'Scales'.
You also collected 13
'Fangs' and 'Eyeballs'.
Total reward is 14595G !!

Hmmm, as I thought! When ya
rank goes up, suddenly ya
motivation increases too!
Now I'll work like mad to
make my fortune!

Today's earnings are... 15
'Eyeballs' and 22 'Fangs'?
Total reward is...ummmh...
3150G. Not bad...perhaps.

You also earned a lot, hey?
Oh how the money you risk ya
life for warms the heart!

Today's earnings are...
3 'Scales' and 8 'Hob-Meat'?
Total reward is 2700G
...Not much is it!?
'Hob-Meat' is quite a rare
booty around here but it
is not registered with the
B-Info. Center for exchange
with prisoner class people.

Aah...too bad!

'Battling' - that's what
Nortune is famous for! Need
parts to customize your Gear?
The best Gear parts are
found here at the Imperial
capital's 'B-Info. Center'!

Just in time for the movement to
strengthen our military power in 
opposition to Aveh's assaults on 
our Imperial capital...
we have new lines of GEAR PARTS!
Don't miss out on getting yours!

For all your Gear needs
come to the B-Info. Center!
We await your next custom!

...I'd like to help but
prisoners don't have Gears,
do they!? Come back when you 
become a 'Battler', OK!

Operator
"Welcome to B-Info. Center!

we exchange. So if you find
any of these items during 
your travels, don't forget 
to bring them here, to the

Informer
"These are the top rewards
we pay to ordinary Battlers.
Prisoners are paid differing
awards according to their
Prisoner Rank!"

Informer
"Here at the B-Info. Center,
we exchange G for the proof
of extermination of sewer
monsters.
But for 'Battlers' and other
special customers, we also
pay G for the 'booty' or
proof of the extermination
of other monsters too.


'Scales','Eyeballs','Fangs'
& 'Hob-Jerky'. So bring such
booty here to cash them in.
You can earn lots of G!

Informer
"...Well, if you're stuck
for money, you know where to
go! As we always say...
It pays to 'B Info-rmed'!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kislev Capital - 1026
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't tune-up my Gear
even if I want to without
'G'. It'll just have to
stay wimpy for now.
Guess I'll go work in
the sewers...

...I made some money, but
now they have new parts...
I want them, but I don't
have enough 'G'....

He's more interested in his
Gear than me. Argh! Gears
need parts, fuel and are
harder to handle than women.

Even under fire, his heart
is on Gears, Gears, Gears.
Nothing but Gears...

Sigh... Maybe I should
look for another man.
I've had it with Battlers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Kislev Capital - 1028
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"...
The outskirts of D-Block?"

Hammer
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
The Battling Arena is on 
the outskirts of D-Block.
Talk to the guard and he 
should let you pass. Bye!"

Hammer
"Bro, I have news!
News!"

Hammer
"The new doctor who was 
appointed today has just
arrived!"

Hammer
"Bro, I have news!
News!"

Hammer
"The new doctor who was
appointed today has just
arrived!"

I know you're being
pursued, but relax!
Here in D-Block nobody
turns on the Champ.
'mongst the inmates of
Nortune's D-Block, the
Battling Champion is 
THE absolute sovereign.
If any of the Imperial
capital's officials
come nosing about, no
prisoner's gonna squeal!

...What business does an
ordinary person have here?
If you're not a prisoner
and you come here, then you
must be either overly
curious, or plain stupid!

The new doctor that came
after that lady doctor got
put in charge of civilians,
barely works here anymore!
It's got to the point that
if you get injured you have
to buy Aquasol with your
own money and cure yourself!
Where did he go to?
Oh, and don't you think he
looks a lot like the guy
that hangs around the Champ?

I'm glad you spoke to me!
See I'm nice to new inmates.
So ask anything you want to!
What's bothering you?
    Where's the 'supplier'?
    What's with the sewers?
    Nothing's bothering me!

...Supplier?
Oh, you mean Hammer!
He's probably at the bar.
You'll know him when you
see him!
Go out the east door, turn
right, and then keep going
straight ahead.
The place with the neon
sign is the bar!

Ahh, the 'Kislev Sewers'!
Why not see for yourself!
Go out the west door and
climb the ladder...
Then once you're on the roof,
the ladder you can see to
the northwest descends into
the 'Kislev Sewers'!

You'll know it by the guy
standing watch near the
entrance. That's his job!

If you get stuck, just ask me!

Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!

The lady doctor of the dorm!
They say she got put in
charge of A-Block! ...She
wasn't downstairs was she?

A-Block's the civilian area
of the Imperial capital
Nortune. That's quite a 
step up for one so young!
As a replacement, it looks
like we will be getting a
new doctor to look after
us in D-Block!

If you get stuck, just ask me!

Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!

The new medical doctor who
just came is quite skilled.
Have you seen him yet?

Nope! No new info lately!

Aveh's actions could mean
disaster for us!
Because of these explosive
collars, us prisoners can't
flee, even if we wanted to!
If they're not careful, all
of us inmates could die!

I am glad that that sewer
monster affair is over.
Now I can get back to work!

Today's earnings weren't so
great...
Boy I wish there was a whole
nest of monsters somewhere,
then I'd have it made! Huh!

A body of one of the Champ's
immediate subordinates was
found in the sewers!
Knowing that a monster big
enough to do that is lurking
below us...sure is scary!
It gives me the shivers!

Thanks to the Champ, the
sewer monster problem
is over.
Oh, and I heard from
the entrance watchman that
you fought against it too!?

You're quite a fighter,
aren't you!?

I hear the Imperial capital
bigwigs are searching to
question the former champ.
I guess it's because of the
rumors about assassinating
the Kaiser. I can't wait to
hear how this turns out!

It seems that after the bout,
the former champ's Gear moved
on it's own accord and crashed 
right into the Kaiser's stand!
The pilot, Rico, was not found
within the Gear, so they put
it down to the machine going
out of control!

Another murder in the sewers!
This time it was Vargas...!
What in blazes is going on!?

Say, didn't you...
...Nothing, forget it!

...Soon they will start the
Battling Imperial Games that
will be watched by the Kaiser
himself... Right then's...

Yeah...errh...
right then's our chance! 
We'll use a Gear...and make
it look like an accident...

!?

What's with you!? Get lost!!

Due to the sewer monster
commotion, they made it off
limits! How are we supposed
to work now? Damn it!

That entrance watchman...
-the nerve of the bastard!-
...said he wouldn't let me
in unless I slip him some
money! That makes me seethe!

I'm a wandering Battler...!
The Battling Games are over,
so I am thinking of leaving
in search of newer battle-
fields. Oh...and don't you
dare ask me how it went!

I'm a wandering Battler. 
I came here to participate
in the Battling matches they
will be holding here soon.
It seems I got here a tad
bit too early!
Sooo, now what am I to do?

I'm a wandering Battler. 
This town's now in a tumult
over a sewer monster.
They say that two expert
Battlers got killed!
It seems they were well
known around here too!
And to think, both killed!
Must of been some creature!
Ohh, heaven forbid!

What, you want the run-down?
    Narh, not interested.
    Yeah, spare no details!

...Suit yourself!

...Well aren't you studious?
Here goes the long version!

Nortune, the capital of the
Kislev Empire, is made up of
five blocks.
D Block is just one of them.
It serves as a giant prison.

A Block's the general town
area, while B Block is the 
industrial area.
C Block houses recreational
facilities, including the 
Imperial Capital's biggest
'Battling Arena' .
Gear faces Gear in bouts of 
single combat - that's what
'Battling' is all about!
And lastly, there is the
'Central Area', from where
Kaiser Sigmund rules over 
the whole Kislev Empire.

There's a rumor that, behind
the scenes, the 'Ethos' is
actually involved with the
'B-Info. Center'.
Officially the 'Battling
Committee' is run by the
Imperial capital, but it
too is rumored to be an 
agent of the 'Ethos'.

Of course this is all gossip!

There's talk that recently
the Champ himself conducted
a 'Baptismal Ceremony'.
I don't know whether it's 
true, but I feel for which
ever prisoner received it!

Hmm...but then again...
it might have been Suzarn.
Or, hold on, was it Vargas?

And to think, the entrance
watchman helped him out so
much. I bet the watchman's
taking it badly!

There was another victim in
the sewers. That makes four!
He wasn't a direct subordinate
of the Champ, but he was a
skilled extermination worker!

I'm a Battler in training,
with Prisoner Rank C!
Looky here, today's menu is
...wooh! ...'Stamina Uppen'!
Whahow! If I eat this up,
I'll increase my stamina 
and before you know it 
I'll be a Battle Master!
...I hope that happens!

*Note: That won't happen!

I'm a Battler in training,
with Prisoner Rank C!
Goody-goody, today's menu is
...wooh!...'Ether Omega'!
Whahow! When I eat this, my
Ether value will shoot up
and, before you know it,
I'll be an Ether Master!
...Man, I hope that happens!

*Note: That won't happen!

In 'Battling', men and women
are called different names.
Generally, males are called 
'Battlers', while females
are called 'Amazonesses'.

Male or female doesn't 
matter on the battlefield!
Strength is everything!
Only the strong survive!

A while back, an airborne
battleship was stolen from
the military facility north
of the Imperial capital.
Later, contact was lost
with it somewhere above
the seas around Aquvy.

I can understand someone
stealing Gear parts from
the military facility near
the capital, but a whole
flying battleship?
That's going a bit too far!

Who would have thought that
someone could beat Ricardo,
Battling's undefeated Champ!
I don't mean disrespect
to the new champion, but
I just don't believe it!

Sorry, forget I ever said that!

The sewer monster commotion
was solved by the efforts of
Rico, our Champ, and the off
limits order was lifted!
But, I heard the Champ was
wounded in the arm while
exterminating the monster.
Not suprising seeing that 
five Battlers got killed!

In this town, when you take
proof of extermination of
sewer monsters to 'B-Info.',
they will exchange it for G,
the currency of this world.
It'll pay to remember this!

Probably went to the bar...?
But isn't it unusual for the 
Imperial capital's bigwigs
to come to D block!?

...The Imperial capital's
Battling Committee members?
Hmm, don't see them here now.
There was a group of three
people who came earlier,
but they've left.

I once heard the sound of a
bell in the sewers.
Perhaps it was a monster who
wore it, but that bell had a
sorrowful tone when rung.

It was so sorrowful, just
as if it was recalling
some sad memory...

...Huh? That means he's even
more powerful than our
current champ...doesn't it?

Then that's no good at all!
It's only made matters worse!
Oh, how I want more power...!

...The Champ's strength is 
incredible. If only someone
would defeat the Champ...
then I might have a chance.

They say there was another
victim found this morning!
That makes five...and Rank
A too!
I can't believe that
it was Suzarn, one of the
Champ's famous gang members!

Nothing like this has ever
happened up until now!
Hey, aren't you THAT guy...

Err, nothing, forget it.

Our food is famous throughout
the Imperial capital!
Especially our dishes cooked
according to Ether theory,
like 'Boosta Limit' and
'HeavyWeighter'...
We provide according to rank
A or B, so you can only have
one or the other.
And it differs
with the individual,
but they are said to bring 
about remarkable effects!

Why do you leave food
on your plates? If you
can't eat all of it...
then don't order it!

Haahh!!

...You shouldn't just 
walk into the kitchen.
That's bad manners!

Oh no you don't! The kitchen
is off limits to prisoners!

Cooking requires love that
is deeper than the seas! And
enticing the partakers of our
food to the peaks of bliss is
the job of cooks like us!

That's right

Cooking requires love that is
higher than the skies! And
enticing the partakers of our
food to the peaks of bliss is
the job of cooks like us!

That's right

Citan
"Fei!
Hold on a second!"

Fei
"What is it doc?
Last night you said we
should act separately..."

Citan
"Yes I know I did.
But there is something 
that I am curious about!
I shall join you in going
to the Battling Arena.
Is it not too late to
split up after that?"

Fei
"...? Well...whatever!
Anyway, let's get going!"

Hammer
"Huff, huff, huff...
I just finished
signing you up!"

Fei
"Gee...that was quick!
Is it really that easy?"

Hammer
"Normally it isn't so easy!
But a woman called Rue from
the Battling Committee seems
to have done some pushing
and pulling on your behalf!"

Fei
"The Battling Committee...?
Oh, you mean those three?"

Hammer
"Well anyway, thanks to
them, the enrolling process
went like a breeze!
Hey hey! This means you can
start Battling whenever you
want to, bro!"

Fei
"But besides that, Hammer,
since yesterday, you've
seemed a little too happy!
Is there something strange
going on behind the scenes
that I don't know about?"

Hammer
"...Huh?
N,n,no! N,nothing! 
N,n,nothing at all!
The mechanic of champions,
me, has had his sins wiped
clean so there is nothing
to be suspect of! Hahaha!"

Fei
"Hmm, really?"

Hammer
"What do you mean?
I told you there is 
nothing at all!
Oooh! 
I've got a lot to do, so 
I'll go on ahead of you!"

Fei
"Oh...!
Hey...!
W,w,wait...!" 

Fei
"What are you up to.
Not saying where
you're going to..."

Fei
"Hammer, you were supposed
to have been in the bar..."

Hammer
"Oh, bro!
You shouldn't worry about
such little details!
If you just rely on me, the
forefront of information,
then you will know it all!
So about this doctor..."

Fei
"...About what doctor?"

Hammer
"What?
You didn't know bro?
The previous lady doctor got
transferred to look after
the civilian sector of town!
Makes you envious, huh!
So's we gets a new doctor to
look after D block. 
They say he just got here!"

Fei
"...The new doctor, eh?
So, what on earth has this
new doctor got to do with 
you, the great 'supplier'?"

Hammer
"What are you talking about
bro? Of course I have
everything to do with him!
If I become chums with him,
I can expand my connections
by establishing black market
medical treatment routes!"

Fei
"...So that's it, huh?
Oh, Hammer, what will
we ever do with you?"

Hammer
"Whatever bro, whatever.
Anyway, let's go say
hello to him, shall we?"

Fei
"Well, yeah, I suppose we
should at least say hello."

Rico
"You're late!
You made me wait for ages!"

Fei
"Oh, errh, sorry!"

Fei
"Later, the doc said he 
wanted to pay the courtesy
of burying the monster...
so I waited outside."

Rico
"...Is that so? Oh well,
at least the murders have
been brought to an end!"

Citan
"Yes, that is right.
And Fei has been proved
innocent as well!"

Rico
"...
And I guess the
out-of-bounds order on the
sewers was lifted straight
after that too ...
Anyway, my allying with you
ends here...
The next time we meet, Fei,
we will be opponents!"

Rico
"C'mon, try and beat me!
I'd enjoy seeing you try to
settle your scores with me!"

Fei
"Hey, what about that wound
to your arm? You can't try
to Battle in that state!"

Rico
"...
Can you really afford to 
worry about your opponent?"

Fei
"...But, Rico?"

Rico
"Worry about yourself before
others! Don't hold back now!
Give me your best fight!"

Rico
"If you don't do your best,
you could be the one who 
dies..."

Fei
"...
Understood..."

Rico
"Right.
That's good..."

Citan
"Right, now that that matter
is resolved, I have done all
I can do to help...
What is left is up to you,
Fei. You must settle this
other problem with your
own hands."

Fei
"...I guess so."

Citan
"Does his arm wound bother
you that much? Fei, you
realize we don't have..."

Fei
"I know doc...
we don't have much time to
spare!
What's more, what he says is
right - you shouldn't hold
back in a battle. Etiquette
dictates a true fight!"

Citan
"It seems I was overly
concerned.
Anyway, let us rest up now.
Remember, you must win up
to the Finals League first.
And the Champ is not the
only one you have to beat!"

Citan
"Right, now that that matter
is resolved, I have done all
I can do to help...
What is left is up to you,
Fei. You must settle this
other problem with your
own hands."

Fei
"...I guess so."

Citan
"Does his arm wound bother
you that much? Fei, you
realize we do not have..."

Fei
"I know doc...
we don't have much time to
spare!
What's more, what he says is
right - you shouldn't hold
back in a battle. Etiquette
dictates a true fight!"

Citan
"It seems I was overly
concerned.
Anyway, let's rest up now.
Remember, you must win up
to the Finals League first.
And the Champ is not the 
only one you have to beat!"

Fei
"I guess I can rest here..."
    Rest up!
    Not yet.

Fei
"...Hey, and rank doesn't
matter anymore!
So, which bed shall I use?"
    Rank A bed
    Rank B bed
    Rank C bed
    Rank D bed

Fei
"I guess I can rest here..."
    Rest up!
    Not yet.

Fei
"The rank A bed it is!"

Fei
"The rank B bed it is!"

Fei
"The rank C bed it is!"

Fei
"The rank C bed it is!"

Fei
"The rank D bed it is!"

Fei
"...Wh, where am I?"

Fei
"...
...Okay.
I'll do what you want!"

Fei
"Huh? ... 
Someone's coming downstairs.
...I guess it'll be Hammer."

Citan
"We do not have such 
time to spare!
We have got to hurry..."

Hammer
"How are you feeling, bro?
All this running backwards
and forwards is killing me!
I know it's a bit sudden but
how about buying something?"
    Not now Hammer!
    I guess I'll have to!

Hammer
"So...maybe not today, but
there's always tomorrow! Buy
something next time, huh!"

Hammer
"Yes! That's my bro!
You're too kind man!
Much appreciated!"

Hammer
"What do you need bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"Thanks bro, but how about
buying something else apart
from items?
It'll help Hammer out too!"
    Enough already!
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"Thanks again bro! Man,
so long as I am with you,
money's no problem, heh!"

Hammer
"Thanks bro, but how about
buying something else apart
from accessories?
It'll help Hammer out too!"
    Enough already!
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"Thanks again bro! Man,
so long as I am with you,
money's no problem, heh!"

Hammer
"The sound of an opening
door! It seems that the new
doc was in the next room!"

Hammer
"Well... If that's how it
is then I'll just go off
and register you now!"

Doctor
"How do you feel? If you
need a rest, you can always
lie down in the next room!"

Doctor 
"Not the 'Baptismal Ceremony'!?
This patient has only just awoke!
It is unthinkable that you would
try and suddenly carry out your 
'Baptismal Ceremony' on him!!!"

Doctor
"I am so sorry! I can't
go against the Battlers!
Please forgive me..."

The lady-doctor Diana
"Yoo-hoo! How are you going?
As I always thought, having
plenty of work to do is what
brings the most happiness!
I'll keep doing my best, so
you too keep up the fight!
As I promised at Nortune...
that's what I will do!"

Suzarn
"Oh look, what good timing!
Prince Charming has woke up!
This may be sudden, but you
have to come along with us!"

Suzarn
"You don't have a choice in
this! If you oppose us, the
fair doctor will cop it too!"

Suzarn
"Oh, what a sensible lad!
That saves us a bit of
trouble.
Anyway, come along now,
the 'Champ' is waiting!
And don't worry! We'll
let you return here soon."

Suzarn
"Hurry up then..."

Suzarn
"Fo-rwa-rd ma-rch!"

Vargas
"Come off it! Just a sec!
That guy's been thrown in 
'ere as a crim, ain't 'e?
You should be thanking
us for 'aving the kind and
compassionate 'eart to let
'im rest up a few days!"

Heinrich
"Yeah, that's right! As long
as he's come here as a crim, 
he's gotta follow the rules!"

Leonardo
"...That's the way it is! 
So without further ado,
we'll borrow him for a 
little while.
Don't worry, we will return 
him to you straight away!
Once we're through with 
him, that is!"

Citan
"...Are you absolutely sure
you want to go through with
this, Fei?
Do you not want to think it
through first? Just to be
sure, I mean! Though you
can trust me...I hope!"

Citan
"What is going on out there?
This is a place for rest!
Can you be a bit quieter..."

Rico
"...Long time no 
see, huh, Kid!"

Rico
"For the sake of my men
too, I am about to check
out the sewers.
I've said what I 
wanted to say..."

Rico
"You want to tag
along, huh?
I don't care.
But you've got to look
after your own neck!"

Rico
"...The doctor too? I don't
take any responsibility if
anything happens to you...!"

Citan
"...
(Finally, it is the last day
of the Games...the finals!
Remember what you-know-who
taught you!)"        

Citan
"(So, be on your way... I
must stay here but I will be
praying for a good fight!)"

Citan
"...
(You are doing well Fei.
Now go to bed and rest!)"

Citan
"(The Games are not over
yet, so try to rest up
before tommorow's bouts.)" 

Citan
"...
(For the time being, I am
a doctor and you are a
prisoner... We should split
up and act separately!)"

Citan
"Well hello, Fei!
Are you wide awake yet...?"

WWWAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHH---!!!

Citan
"..."

Fei
"...
(He's deep in thought...
I don't think he heard me.)"

Citan
"Fei! Where are you off to?
We have not yet finished
this discussion!"

Citan
"Fei! Let us finish this
discussion first before
you go to bed!"

...RATTLE! RATTLE!

Citan
"Mmm...This is...
harder than...
I thought!"

...CLATTER! CLATTER! ...CLANG!

Fei
"Uuuh... Aaah...
Gasp... Uuuugh..."

Fei
"...
Where am I...
Oh, the infirmary?"

Fei
"Doc...
What happened to me...?
How did I get here...?"

Citan
"During the Battling match
...there was a sudden
explosion...remember?"

Fei
"...That's right...
In that explosion...
I lost consciousness!?"

Citan
"It was a large explosion,
but you were fortunate the
Gear was Weltall...!
Any other Gear and I
would hate to think...
Anyway, you are safe,
that is what matters!"

Fei
"Thanks to...
Weltall, huh?"

Fei
"...Doc.
How many days have
passed since then?"

Citan
"Only a day has elapsed
since the accident.
Your injuries were 
relatively minor, so..."

Fei
"Only one day...
..."

Citan
"What is the matter, 
Fei...?"

Fei
"I had an awful dream...
I can't remember it, but...
I just know it was awful..."

Citan
"A dream...?"

Fei
"...It was nothing, I guess.
Don't worry about it, doc."

Citan
"..."

Fei
"Doc, I've got to get
back to the Battling.
I want to get this
explosive collar off
of me as soon as I can."

Citan
"Fei, how is your health
holding up? I do not want
you to push yourself..."

Fei
"There's no use saying that.
Time is not going to wait!
I can't just do nothing..."

Citan
"...I suppose you are
right. I understand what you
mean, Fei.
We have got to try and get
out of here as soon as
we possibly can."

Citan
"But that does not mean you
have to over-exert yourself
again, straight away!
Take time to rest up
a little more..."

Fei
"You're the doc, ...doc!
I'll try... and get...
a little more... rest..."

Fei
"Hey, you're...Rico!?
What are you doing here?"

Rico
"Calm down, kid!
I didn't come here
to fight with you..."

Fei
"Then what purpose do you 
have here? What other
reason could you have?"

Citan
"Why, it is only you Fei!
And...
the Battling Champion?"

Citan
"What would the likes of
you have to do coming to
a prison barracks?
There must be some special
reason for you to grace 
us with your presence?"

Rico
"Yes there is.
...I came in regards to the
incident of the explosion
during the first rounds of
the Battling contest."

Fei
"Explosion incident?
...Oh, you mean what
happened the other day!"

Citan
"The explosion accident that
Fei was enveloped in during
that bout?
What has that got to do
with you?"

Rico
"...I'm sorry.
That 'accident' was set
up by my subordinates!
After the results of your
'Baptismal Ceremony', it
seems my men didn't come
to like you very much..."

Citan
"So they made it look like
an accident, but it really
was meant to kill Fei...
But why tell us now?
Did they come clean and
confess the crimes they 
committed?"

Rico
"...They're no 
longer with us!
You're the doctor, don't you
know what's been happening?
What's going on here in the
Imperial capital's D Block?"

Citan
"You mean the series of
mysterious murders that
happened in the sewers!?"

Rico
"...Yes. A line of skilled
Battlers have been murdered
one after the other!
All of the victims that
have been killed were
my subordinates..."

Rico
"Kid...
I mean, Fei...!
They were the very people
who had set that trap to 
kill you!"

Fei
"So what are you trying to
say? That their deaths are
connected to me somehow!?"

Citan
"Let us see... The murdered
Battlers had set a trap to
try and kill Fei...
When Fei comes to know of
this he has good reason 
to kill them...
Out of hatred of his would-
be killers, he plots
revenge on the Battlers.
And turns to 'murder'!"

Fei
"...People think
I am the killer?"

Rico
"Exactly!
This morning there was yet
another victim...the fifth!
It's not unusual for people
to die in the sewers.
If you become weak, you die
...that's providence!
But 5 Battlers were killed
in a row!
That this is unprecedented
alone casts doubt on you.
To say that I don't doubt
you would be lying, but
I don't think you are
guilty, either.
The only thing that can
prove your innocence is
if there is any truth in
that story going round...
The story of a monster in
the sewers that is strong
enough to kill 5 Battlers!"

Fei
"Wait up! Let me...
Let me go with you!
I want to prove to you that
I am innocent myself!"

Citan
"It is up to Fei himself
to prove that he has 
been falsely suspected...
...There is no alternative,
then. Please allow me to
accompany you in solving
this sewer murder case!"

Citan
"Hey, Fei. Are you fully
prepared now? There is no
turning back after this!"

Fei
"Well,  I errh..."
    Still got stuff to do!
    I am totally prepared!

Citan
"...Is that so?
Well, get moving!
Time is of the essence!"

Citan
"...There is still some time
before the train comes...
Let us rest here a little!"

Doctor
"Life here is tough, but
first it might be better
if you meet with Hammer!
Hammer is a 'provider' of
things and information.
He might appear strange but
he is good on the inside.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first.
I'm sure he'll be of help!"

Doctor
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
You should go and thank
Hammer.
He's the one that carried
you here from that back
alley where you collapsed!
Hammer's the local 
'supplier' of things 
and information.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first!"

Doctor
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
You should go and thank
Hammer.
He's the one that carried
you here from that back
alley where you collapsed!
Hammer's the local 
'supplier' of things 
and information.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first!"

Doctor
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
You should go and thank
Hammer.
He's the one that carried
you here from that back
alley where you collapsed!
Hammer's the local 
'supplier' of things 
and information.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first!"

Doctor
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
You should go and thank
Hammer.
He's the one that carried
you here from that back
alley where you collapsed!
Hammer's the local 
'supplier' of things 
and information.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first!"

Good, you've finally woken up!
...You have been unconscious
for four days, so I had begun
to fear the worst.

Fei
"...Who are you?
And where am I?
How did I get here...?"

Fei
"Ah,
uuuugh...!"

You've only just gained
consciousness, so don't
push yourself too much!
I am a doctor.
You are in Nortune, the
Imperial capital of Kislev.
This is the detention area
for criminals...commonly 
known as 'D block'.

Fei
"Detention area for...
...criminals?"

Doctor
"You are now in a living 
quarters for prisoners in
D block...
Judging by the way you were
brought here under the heavy
guard of the Kislev army, you
are no ordinary criminal...!"

Doctor
"Huh!?"

Fei
"Uuugh... ?
Where am I this time?"

Doctor
"...You're in the same place,
just in a different room!
You've had a rough day, heh?"

Fei
"Ah! ...Oh it's you?
It looks like I needed your
assistance again, huh...?"

Doctor
"Yes, but don't worry. I
don't mind - it's my job!
Anyway, how do you feel?"

Fei
"Hm? Aaah...
I'm in a bit of pain, but
nothing I can't cope with...
Lately I've been getting
used to this kind of thing.
Aah...!
The last thing I remember 
was those guys speaking of 
what 'rank' they think I am
worthy of."

Doctor
"Oh,
I think I better tell
you about that..."

Fei
"What? 
You know what rank I am?"

Doctor
"You're quite strong, aren't
you!? To defeat four people
in your condition...it's no 
wonder they gave you rank A!
But to go up against
the Champ...? 
It's amazing that you 
came back alive at all!"

Fei
"The fight was meaningless.
I had no reason to ...
I didn't want to fight..."

Doctor
"...What happened?
You look a bit pale."

Fei
"It's nothing. Don't worry.
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

Doctor
"I was surprised! Your rank is
B! They say you defeated three
people, and in your condition!"

Fei
"Yeah, I beat three of them.
But I ran out of energy
when I came to the fourth."

Doctor
"But that was incredible!
It makes me wonder how you 
would have gone if you had 
recovered fully beforehand."

Fei
"Hmm, I wonder too...
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

Doctor
"I think you were ranked C.
I doubt they would give you
anything higher if you only 
beat one or two people."

Fei
"...C Rank?
Huh, that would be 
about right for me."

Doctor
"Don't put yourself down.
You'll never survive here
if you have that attitude!"

Fei
"...Survive here? ...Huh?
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

Doctor
"I believe you were rank C.
But in your condition, you
did well just to beat one
opponent!"

Fei
"...Rank C?
Can I ask you a question?
Is rank that important?"

Doctor
"Most think that stronger 
is better, but...
well...
It allows you to rise above
living as a normal citizen.
If that's important to you 
then rank is important too!"

Fei
"I see...!
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

Doctor
"...You're rank D.
But that's understandable
considering your condition.
The very idea of 'Baptism'
is absurd to begin with!"

Fei
"...You mean...
I'm the lowest rank?"

Doctor
"To put it bluntly, yes!"

Fei
"Hmm...
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

Doctor
"Oh that? 
It's a bomb...
The moment you leave the 
vicinity of the Imperial 
capital, that collar goes
'BOOM'!
Too bad, but while
you have that on, you 
will never be able to 
escape from Nortune.
Apart from the civilians
of D Block and a select
few Battlers, everybody
has to wear them..."

Doctor
"...Here in D Block, 
that is the only chain 
that binds the prisoners."

Fei
"Huh, a bomb? So no matter
how much I struggle, I'll 
never escape from here."

Doctor
"Anyway, you should try and
get some rest today.
You'll have to get used to 
life in this town soon too."

Fei
"You say a new doctor
has come, but...
there's nobody here!"

Hammer
"Huh? That's strange...
according to my sources
he should be here...!"

Fei
"Too bad he's not here,
huh Hammer!
Looks like you'll have to
forget about those black
market medical treatment
routes you were..."

!!

!?

Fei
"D, d, doc?
Citan?
What are you doing here!?"

Citan
"I monitored Kislev's
radio communications...
I heard them talking about
a Gear they recovered in
Kislev that fit the
description of Weltall.
They said they transported
it to their capital, so I
came here on the off chance
I might also find you here!"

Hammer
"Huh? You wouldn't by
any chance know this
doctor, would you bro?"

Citan
"So anyway, Fei,
have you taken
any action yet?"

Fei
"...Taken any action?
What do you mean by 
that, doc?"

Citan
"You cannot stay in here 
forever, can you?
Are you not going to
escape?"

Fei
"Escape?"

Citan
"Fei! You are not intending
to spend the rest of your
life here are you?
You do not mind breaking
your promise, then?"

Fei
"What promise...?"

Citan
"Oh my! How could you
forget such an important
thing as that?
You promised Bart that you
would protect Margie and
the people of Nisan if
anything happened to him!"

Fei
"Oh that? I did promise
that, didn't I...!?
But...has something
happened to Bart?"

Citan
"I am afraid to say so.
He fought bravely against
the enemy's new forces...
But it was in vain! 
The Yggdrasil was badly
damaged and sank to the
bottom of the sea of sand.
Just before the ship sank,
I jumped in an escape-pod
and jettisoned out of there
so that I was not engulfed.
Since then, I regret to say
I could find out nothing of
the others' whereabouts or
fates..."

Fei
"Who would have thought...
What was I doing...?"

Citan
"What in the heavens
happened, Fei?"

Fei
"Once again...
I lost all memory...
and all sense of time...
While I was fighting that
Vanderkaum guy, he, Grahf,
appeared... Then I realized
Bart and the crew's plight.
The other guys with me were
defeated by Vanderkaum and
his giant-sized Gear...
After that...
After that...it was like
Lahan village over again!
When I woke up, I was in
Nortune's prison block..."

Fei
"Doc, what happened
to the squadron at
the borderlands?
What is the meaning of my
being here and Weltall
having been recovered in
Kislev...?"

Citan
"...That squadron
was annihilated!
There was also wreckage
of a giant-sized Gear...
the likes of which I have
never seen before!"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Come on now Fei!
Nobody is pointing
their finger at you!
It might have been caused
by something else!"

Fei
"It's alright, doc.
Little by little I've been
coming to understand it."

Fei
"Just maybe...
No...most surely...
I've done it again..."

Citan
"Oh, Fei..."

Fei
"I'll keep my promise...
Otherwise I'd never be 
able to look Bart in the
face again...
Cause Bart and them are
alive somewhere...
I just know that they
are!"

Citan
"So that means..."

Fei
"I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to get out of here!
Will you help me out doc?"

Citan
"Of course.
It will be my pleasure!"

Hammer
"No, bro, I doubt it!
Any thought of leaving
here is just a dream!"

Citan
"Why do you say that?"

Hammer
"Cause of these things!
They're explosive collars!
As long as we are wearing 
these, we'll never be able
to set foot out of here!"

Citan
"Explosive collars...?
That is dangerous
of them, is it not!?
Allow me to have a 
little look at it, 
please."

Citan
"...Let me see...Hmmm...
Well, well...Ah, ha...
Ohhh...Humph..."

Citan
"We might just possibly be
able to do something about
these."

Hammer
"Re, really!? ...Even
mechanical engineers gave
up on these in despair!"

Fei
"Doc was always good at
tinkering with machines.
So I guess there's hope!"

Hammer
"I don't know, bro!
Let's leave them alone!
No matter how good he is...
One tiny mistake and it's
BOOM! BANG! Game Over, man!
Get Hammer's drift, bro!?"

Fei
"...It's alright.
I believe in doc!"

Citan
"...Well then, shall
we give it a try?"

Fei
"So, let's..."
    Take a rest first!
    Do it now, doc!
    Forget about it!

Citan
"Yes, let us rest up a
little first. In the
meantime, think carefully
about it!"

Fei
"...Yeah, I'm ready to do
it now. We may as well get
it over with then, huh!"

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

Hammer
"Oh bro! Please don't!
No matter how you look at
it, it's too dangerous!"

Citan
"Well then, Fei,
have you made up 
your mind yet?"

Fei
"Yes, well, errh, let's..."
    Wait a bit longer!
    Do it now, doc!
    Not do this, doc!

Citan
"...Well then, when you
you are ready, let me know 
as soon as possible, OK!"

Fei
"...Yeah.
Ready when you are doc!
No turning back, now, huh!"

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

Citan
"Fei!!
What is wrong!?"

Fei
"Errh, arrh...doc?
Wh, wh, what just happened?
Wh, what was that?"

Citan
"You scared the heck out of
me, suddenly shouting like
that. Is everything O.K.?
Anyway, are you absolutely
sure now? 
I will start removing the
explosive collar then..."

Fei
"Let's not do this!
I've a bad feeling about it.
Sorry, doc..."

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

Citan
"Well then... You are
sure you want to 
go through with it so..."

Hammer
"...Oooh, broooo!"

Citan
"Well then...
let us give
it a go..."

CLANK!

Citan
"Ah!
oop... Oh-oh!"

Fei
"Doc! What was that sound?
...And...what's that
behind your back?"

Citan
"Huh? Oh, err...
It is nothing, Fei.
Hahaha, nothing at all!"

Hammer
"Tha, tha, that part is...
the explosive collar's
safety device, isn't it!?"

Citan
"...S, sorry.
I did what I..."

Fei
"It's alright, doc.
It doesn't matter if you
take off one or two parts...
We are going to take the
whole thing off anyway!"

Citan
"...Err, well Fei...
What I just removed was 
the bomb's safety device..."

Fei
"Safety device...?
What does it do?"

Hammer
"Well bro...put simply, a
safety device is what stops
a bomb from exploding.
When you remove a safety
device from a bomb...
it means the bomb could
explode at any time!"

Fei
"..."

Fei
"This is bad!?
Hurry up and get this
thing off of me doc!"

Citan
"Now that it has no
safety device, if I mess up
while tampering with it...
then it is the end of us!
There is nothing more 
that I can do, Fei!
...I am so sorry!"

Citan
"It seems that these bombs
will not explode unless
given a very strong shock.
They are delicate when you
mess inside them, but they
are extremely good at
'shock absorption'...
...as you can tell from the
fact that even competitors
wear them in the Battling
Tournaments."

Fei
"But, no matter how shock
absorbant it is, it's still
dangerous in this state!?"

Citan
"That is true...
If only there was
something else we
could do besides
risky tinkering!"

Hammer
"Excuse me, doctor, but...
would you mind giving 
me that safety device?
It would fetch a fair price
if sold to a collector.
Of course I'd be willing
to pay you for it!"

Citan
"...This thing? 
Well I do not mind.
What do you think Fei?"

Fei
"Well it's of no value to
us to keep it now, is it?
...He can have it, doc!"

Citan
"Well then, 
here you go..."

Hammer
"Hee-hee. Thank you, man!
Take this as payment..."

Citan
"...But, we are still left
with the same problem.
If only there was a better
way of getting rid of that
explosive collar...!?"

CL...ANK

Citan
"Ah!
...Oh, dear!"

Hammer
"Th, th, that part is...!"

Hammer
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
There is a way of having
these collars removed...
It requires you winning a
'Special Pardon' in the
Imperial Games, though..."

Citan
"A 'Special Pardon'?"

Hammer
"Yes. Every year they
hold the Imperial Games
of Battling.
The Kaiser himself watches
over the Battling matches
and cancels any sentence
the winner is serving.
Also the winner is given
a position as a military
officer as an added bonus!"

Citan
"Well then, all we have to 
do is win at the Games then!
Do we not, Fei?"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is 
hopeless!
To do that you will have 
to defeat the current 
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro here was
totally beaten by that
very person just days ago!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro, here was
just beaten by one of the
Champ's subordinates!
We don't even know
how strong the Champ
himself is yet..."

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
The Champ's prison ranking
is rank S! 
That's well above rank A 
even!
Our bro here is only rank
C. Our bro could very well
die if he attempts to
challenge the Champ!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current 
champion, Master Rico!
The Champ's prison ranking
is rank S! 
That's well above rank A
even!
Our bro here is only rank
C. Our bro could very well
die if he attempts to 
challenge the Champ!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro here, is the
same as I am...Rank D! The
difference from the Champ to
us is like man and mouse!"

Hammer
"And this time we're 
talking about Battling!
With Gears, bro, Gears!
There's no assurance of
your safety. He could very
well kill you by pretending
to cause an accident!"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Really?"

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
Yet if I were to come up
against him seriously...
I am not sure whether I
could win or not."

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
I defeated 3 Battlers, but
I lost to the fourth, that
Suzarn woman... I might be
able to beat her, perhaps."

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them..."

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them..."

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
I don't wan't to hide
behind the excuse that I
had not recovered from my
injuries at the time...
But the truth is I didn't
even beat one of them!
Who knows whether I could
beat them next time...!?"

Citan
"Is he really that much
stronger than the other 4
Battlers, this Champ chap?"

Hammer
"Put it this way...
He's the undefeated king,
reigning at the summit of
the Imperial capital's 
Battling Tournaments!
With a history of 40 bouts
ending in 40 K.O.s, most of
which occured within 30
seconds from start time...
If he wins this year's
Imperial Games then he'll
be the reigning champion
for three years running!"

Citan
"Just one second!
Is this person a 
prisoner?"

Hammer
"Yes he is."

Citan
"That is strange... The
winner is supposed to
receive a pardon, right?
Why is he still a
prisoner now then?"

Hammer
"That's the thing! Master
Rico could have said good-
bye to prison life by now!
But they say he turned
down his pardon.
I guess he must like his
fighting a great deal...!"

Fei
"Well, we can't just stand
round here talking about
it.
I don't care whether it is
Battling or whatever! If
there is a chance then I am
going to try and take it!"

Hammer
"Are you serious?"

Fei
"Yes, I am."

Hammer
"Do you think you can win?"

Fei
"No, I don't.
But, for now, I can
only give it a try!"

Fei
"That Hammer...
He looked very pleased
all of a sudden!"

Citan
"...But are you alright
about this?
As we spoke about before...
Whether you are forced to
or not...you did not
want to do this, right?
Fight with Gears, I mean!?"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"There are most probably
other ways to get out of
here.
Fei, I do not want to
push you into anything 
you do not want to do!"

Fei
"I know doc.
I still don't like Gears.
That much hasn't changed.
When I pilot them, I become
aware of how unstable my
very 'being' is...even if
I don't want to think of it!
But at the same time, it is
also a connection with some
lost 'part' of me.
If that's the case then,
recently, I decided I would
stick with it to the end.
Elly also had been troubled
by the same thing. And if I
just stay depressed about
it, nothing will improve!"

Citan
"Is that how you feel...?
I think I understand
you better now, Fei.
Anyway, let us get
some rest today.
We are going to
become busy!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

15 years ago, in the
Empire, there was a great
riot. There were many
casualties...

Ricardo was one of the
many casualties...
He had a lot of friends
but most were lost in
that great riot.

It was said that the cause
of the riot was due to the
friction between the
'Ethos' and the Kaiser.

During the riot in the
Empire, homes and families
were lost...
Those fragmented memories
still remain as scars to
many of the children.

The only thing brought
about by war are wasted
lives that only act as
reparations for the
destruction. What is
there to gain in a world
wrought with
destruction...We, the
people, stand upon a long
history of conflict and
war...Is it but only an
illusionary world where
we may all embrace each
other and live in a world
of cooperation?

...Sob.I wish I could
go outside...

Um, did you see my
brother outside? I'm...
always the one left
behind. They won't play
with me. They say it's
too dangerous for me to
go outside...

This place...?
It's a Nisan facility.
Who are you?

I'm...not lonely...
Even without a mother or
father...I have a lot of
friends here. Even the
sisters...Sob...

The fire enveloped
everyone. Papa, mama, my
home...everything.
I don't know...after
that...I was here.

I hate...fire, I hate
everyone... Papa and mama
were...eaten by the fire!
Water...if there were
only lots of water...

Fei
"...Not here either...
Must have left already?"

Fei
"Huh?"

Fei
"...Gears, huh?"

Fei
"Whoa!?"

Hammer
"Bro, doesn't it seem like
there's something missing
here in D Block?
Something, or things, that
you could find elsewhere,
but can't find here?
Yeah, yeah?
Don't you think so, bro?"
    ...No, not really
    Come to think of it

Hammer
"Wha, what? No?
Not really? Hmm.
That's strange."

Hammer
"Yeah, what's missing are
item shops, oh, and don't
forget the weapon shops..."

Hammer
"Ya need anything, bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"It's too expensive
elsewhere! Yep.
You know it's gotta be
'Hammer's Ether Bag'!"

Hammer
"It's too expensive
elsewhere! Yep.
You know it's gotta be

Beastoid man
"Oh, allow me to introduce
myself... They call me,
'Hammer - the Supplier'.
It's been a long time since
such a powerful criminal
has been sent to D Block!
Heh-heh, so that makes you
pretty famous in this town.
In other words, you're the
center of attention, bro!"

Beastoid man
"Oh, allow me to introduce
myself... They call me,
'Hammer - the Supplier'.
Actually, it's the second
time we've met...
The first time, bro, you
were knocked out cold..."

Beastoid man
"Oh, allow me to introduce
myself... They call me,
'Hammer - the Supplier'.
Actually, it's the second
time we've met...
The first time, bro, you
were knocked out cold..."

Beastoid man
"Ah!?"

Beastoid man
"Hey brother! You, bro!
...Here, over here!"

Hammer
"Hey, bro!
You have that look in your
eyes as if you're looking
for something, right?
I knew it, bro! You're
looking to buy some items.
    Not now
    Whatcha got?

Hammer
"That's odd... You don't
need anything? Well, there
is always next time, heh!"

Hammer
"I knew it!
My eyes are as keen
as a hawk, heh!"

Hammer
"So whatcha need, bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"It's too expensive
elsewhere! Yep.
You know it's gotta be
'Hammer's Ether Bag'!"

Hammer
"It's too expensive
elsewhere! Yep.
You know it's gotta be
'Hammer's Ether Bag'!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Oh...bro."

Latina
"I knew your power was genuine!
You even took out the Champ.
It explains why I couldn't
win against you. Figures."

Latina
"Youch ouch ouch...
W, welcome, Fei.
That last fight you had
with me was good fun, heh?
Huh, you don't remember...?
Aww well...
The last bout you fought
before the finals was meee.
Ouch ouch ouch... Hahahaha,
I feel so pathetic...
I'm looking forward to the
final round. I think you
might actually be able to
defeat the Champ, Ricardo.
It's hurts to say this, but
do your best for me, too!"

Latina
"Looks like the sewer homicide
cases have all been wrapped up!
It was rumored within D Block
that you were the culprit.
But, it's good to know that
we can all put this thing
behind us...
I'm glad for you too.
Oh, and, they removed the
suspension of the Battling
Tournament!
The fruits of your efforts have
made a lot of people happy!"

Latina
"That explosion incident
at the tournament really
surprised me.
That was no accide...
Ah, never mind...
Are you feeling better?"

Latina
"So you're going to be
participating in the
Battling too, huh?
Hehe, good luck!"

Latina
"Welcome to 'Latina's Bar'.
Make yourself comfortable!"

Latina
"Oh, Fei, wait a sec.
Hammer just went but he
left a message for you.
He wants you to meet him at
the 'Wildcat' bar, in the
civilian part of the city,
once you've taken care of
everything. You got that!?"

Mystery woman
"...I finally get to meet
you. You're Fei, right?
...And, uh, outta the way!!"

Woman called Ms. Cohen
"You men are hopeless!
This is why I didn't want
to come with you two.
Huhmm, allow me to introduce
myself. I'm Rue Cohen from
the 'Imperial Battling
Committee' in B Block of
this, the Imperial capital."

Committee Member Rue
"Oh, shush!
You two keep quiet!!"

Committee Member Rue
"Well then, hope to talk
to you again...soon!"

 !? 

Woman's subordinate?
"Uh, forgive us, Ms. Cohen!!"

Subordinate
"Indeed, we ask too much!"

Subordinate
"Uh, sorry, Ms. Cohen!!"

 !? 

Woman's subordinate?
"Uh, forgive us, Ms. Cohen!!"

Subordinate
"Indeed, we ask too much!"

Subordinate
"Uh, sorry, Ms. Cohen!!"

Tina... Latina... hic...
...Gimme anudder drink...

Latina is lookin' good as
always.
She's our block's Venus.
Don't you think so too?
And on top of that, she's
a certified Amazoness...
I wouldn't mind being beaten
up...only if it was by Latina!

Oh, if it isn't...you!
Hey, aren't you the
Battling Champ!?
I, is there something I
can do for you? Please
forgive me for any
disrespect in the past.
Oh yeah, by the way, you
can exchange monster items
for prizes at the Imperial
capital's B-Info... uh...
What am I saying!?

You look like you're new
here so I'll give you
some special advice.
Around here, if you don't
work, you're not gonna
earn your day's keep.
'If you don't work, you
don't eat', is how it is!
That's where prisoners like
you come into things...
Your job is to clean up the
sewers. It's not like there
aren't any other jobs...
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong.
When I say cleaning I don't
mean you use a mop to polish
the floors, or whatever...
Here in D Block,
'cleaning' is what we
call exterminating all
the monsters that live
down in the sewers.
As long as you get rid of
those monsters down there,
you shouldn't have a problem
makin' a living around here.
The rest is up to you...

By the way, I'm no prisoner.
I'm a freelancing profiteer
you can find almost anywhere.
Even if you're not a prisoner,
you can always exchange items
for money here.

If you're sent here, you're
pretty much sentenced for life.
...I'll probably never be able
to set foot on my homeland
again...sigh...

I know you shouldn't drown
your sorrows in liquor...
I know...but I can't stop!

Around here, the criminals are
higher up than the residents...
The powerless have no other
choice but to kneel down.

...Who were you again?
Huh? ...Battling Champ?
I have no interest
in such things.
By the way, is
that stuff good?

You're an unfamiliar face.
But then again, I don't care
much for remembering each and
every face I see anyway...

Guard
"I used to be in charge
of security in the
civilian area...
But because of a minor
mistake, they shipped
me off to look after
D Block..."

Guard
"Maybe I'm...
not cut out
for this job?"

Hammer's gone.
Without him around...
you know, it's kinda
lonely in this bar.

I kinda feel like I'm
gettin' ripped off by
Hammer.
Are his items really that
cheap...? Hmm.

Fei
"...Could you stop calling
me 'bro'? My name is Fei!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"...What's wrong with it?
It's not like I'm putting
you down.
What, would you prefer
me to call you 'sir'
or something?"

Fei
"...
Oh, do whatever you wish."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Then it's decided.
I'll continue to call
you bro from now on!
By the way, bro, I hear
you're really strong.
Not many get rank A, you
know! I'm pretty impressed!
...And what's more, bro,
you seem different from
the other prisoners."

Fei
"...Different, huh?
Well you don't look
so normal yourself!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"It's not meant to be an
insult... Just a feeling
I have. No deep meaning!
Oh, and if you have any
problems, talk to me!
Since I'm a supplier, I've
got all the connections!"

Fei
"So you're Hammer...
I heard your name from
the doctor...
But I didn't expect you
not to be, errh, human."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"That's cruel.
Humans, beastoids...
we're all living beings!
But of course we do
look different on
the outside though."

Fei
"I, I'm sorry.
You're the guy who saved
me and all I do is..."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Oh, uh, it's okay.
Oh yes, about the results
of your Baptism!
Awesome! They say you took
down that despicable Vargas
guy like he was nothing.
Now that's a big deal!
It even makes me feel good!
But he tends to be the type
to hold a grudge so...
you had better be careful!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"I know this is all sudden
and all but, I'm gonna call
you 'bro' from now on!"

Fei
"Wait a minute!
What's this 'bro' thing?
My name is Fei."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"What's wrong with it?
You don't wanna be called
'bro' that badly?"

Fei
"It's not that I
don't like it..."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Well, then it's settled!
Oh, and if you have any
problems, come talk to me.
Since I am a supplier,
I've got all the right
connections!
So whenever your in a jam,
Hammer, 'the Supplier',
will do whatever he can!"

Fei
"Oh, so you're Hammer...
Boy, do you look strange!
What's with the costume?"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Costume...? Lay off bro,
I'm a beastoid! That's
kinda rude, ya know."

Fei
"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
...A beastoid, huh?
So you're not human then?"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Anyway, about that
Baptism thing...
Don't you feel tricked when
regardless of whether you
defeat one or two people,
you're given the same rank?
I heard you were injured
when you went through it...
That means we have yet to
see your full potential!"

Fei
"...Who knows?
It's not as easy
as you think..."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"You seem kinda down, bro.
It'll only make life harder
if you be like that!"

Fei
"...Didn't I tell you?
The name's Fei.
Don't call me 'bro'!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Don't get all mad, bro.
Hammer's just tryin' to
help, you know."

Fei
"...Sorry. So much is
happening at once that
I'm becoming irritated."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"...Umm, you don't...want
me to call you...'bro'?"

Fei
"Hah...sure, why not.
Call me what you want,
...I won't get mad."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"...Oh good!
And bro, if you have any
problems, come talk to me!
I promise to do whatever I
can, or else my name isn't
'Hammer - the Supplier'.
And although I may look
like this, I am still a
supplier, so I've got all
the right connections!"

Fei
"...Supplier? If you're
here, then that means
you're a prisoner too?"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Heh, I slipped up and got
caught, OK! ... By the way,
how are your wounds?"

Fei
"Huh?
Oh, fine thanks to you...
Oh yeah, I haven't thanked
you yet... Sorry I caused
you so much trouble..."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"You don't have to thank
me! Just to let you know,
I'm also rank D!
But then again, how could
a supplier like me beat
Battlers like them! That's
how it goes, heh, bro!?"

Fei
"What's with this 'bro'?
My name is Fei. Could you
stop calling me 'bro'...?"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"C'mon. We're both D rank,
right? Let's be friends!
Pleeeze!"

Fei
"...
Oh, do whatever!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Oh wait! Bro! If you've
got any problems, come
and talk to me!
There's nothing I don't
know about this D block!
And I am a supplier, so
I've got the connections!"

Fei
"...Imperial Battling
Committee?
What do you want with me?"

Committee Member Rue
"...I'll cut to the point.
We want you to participate
in the Battling tournament."

Fei
"...Battling?"

Committee Member Rue
"It's a recreational sport,
where Gear fights against
Gear, or even Gear fights
against monster depending
on the program.
Currently, there are no
regulations for eligibility.
And we, the committee,
rarely interact with the
participants directly.
You should be honored.
You are in luck that your
little incident with the
'Champ' caught our
attention so soon.
...So how about it?
Better a Battler than 
a prisoner...
It's not a bad deal 
at all."

Fei
"...I'm sorry, but I
don't like Gears.
I have no interest in such
recreational tournaments.
And above all, I don't even
have a Gear, so even if I
wanted to participate, I
can't. You ask too much!"

Committee Member Rue
"Hmm, forgive me...
But do not worry about
the latter problem.
The Gear you require
for the Battling will
be provided by the
committee.
...So, will you
participate then?"

Fei
"Don't make me repeat
myself.
I hate Gears and I'm
not interested in
that kind of stuff!"

Committee Member Rue
"If you won't change your
mind then you'll...
Well, you're still new here.
I'll give you more time.
Perhaps we may have been
too pushy... But please,
think about this offer
seriously. I'll be looking
forward to a favorable reply."

Fei
"Ha, Hammer!?"

Hammer
"Why did you do that,
bro?"

Fei
"Wait, Hammer.
What are you 
talking about?"

Hammer
"I overheard it all with
my own ears! Why did you
reject their invitation?
It's truly a rare occasion
for the committee to
personally make contact!
It's still not too late!
Do it, bro. We can still
make it, right? You'll be
a Battler... A Battler!!"

Fei
"Oh, that...
If you overheard, you
should already know.
I don't like fighting.
And Gears, well...!
Moreover, there is no
reason for me to do it."

Hammer
"If you become a Battler,
you can leave the prison
and live in luxury!
Power is everything here!
The powerless...the weak
are just oppressed!!
So c'mon, give it a try!"

Fei
"...
...Is that all?"

Hammer
"Huh? 
What do you mean?"

Fei
"...Are you done?"

Hammer
"...Done?"

Fei
"You've said enough...
Now could you move
out of the way?
Hammer, sorry, but I doubt
my feelings will change...
Fighting and Gears, I hate
them both. So too bad!"

Fei
"...I am Fei Fong Wong.
And what's your name?
I know it's not really
'Champ'?
I at least have the right
to know that much..."

No good. It's locked.

Suzarn
"Champ, we've brought
him to you."

Suzarn
"Why you...!? 
How insolent!!"

A man called 'Champ'
"Thanks Suzarn.
Hmmm, so you're the
new inmate...
We don't know or care what
you did to get put in here,
but welcome to D Block...
So what name do you go by?"

Champ
"Calm down Suzarn.
I don't mind...
The name's Rico."

Rico
"Kid...
It's good to have guts...
if it's the real thing...
We know it's a bit sudden,
but we need to see how
strong you really are..."

Rico
"Heinrich!"

Rico
"Vargas!"

Rico
"Leonardo!"

Rico
"Suzarn!"

Rico
"Let's begin his 'Baptism'!
Take him outside!"

Hammer
"B,b, bro-!!
Are you he-re?"

Rue
"Anyway...
This room is yours to use.
Next door is your bedroom.
Oh...and, Fei.
Now you will be given the
title of Champion as well as
special S Rank priviledges."

Rue
"Well, congratulations
on winning the Battling
championship...
We were able to take some
very good data...
Ha ha hm.
One more thing, good news.
Kaiser Sigmund would like 
to meet you, Champion Fei.
Please stop by the Central
Administrative District.

Rue
"Well... good bye."

Fei
"There is still some
time until the train
passes by..."

Citan
"Well, if everything is
ready then, why not
take a light nap?"

Citan
"So, you are now free in
both name and...reality,
right?"

Hammer
"So, what are you
gonna do now, bro?
Leave Nortune?"

Citan
"We are not yet finished.
There is one thing left
to do here."

Fei
"...I know.
It's Weltall, right?
We can't just leave
it here.
We have to get it 
back somehow..."

Citan
"It is best if we assume
Weltall has been moved
to a different dock..."

Citan
"So, I guess that is
where you come in,
... Hammer!"

Hammer
"Got it, doctor!
I'll find out where your
Gear is... I'll bet my name
as the 'Imperial capital's 
No.1 Supplier' on it!"

Fei
"Okay then, let's
work separately.
I'll work by myself,
while you, Hammer and
doc, work together..."

Hammer
"Bro, don't you trust
me or something?
I work better alone!
Nothing against Citan,
but he'll just get in
the way, bro."

Hammer
"So then...
just leave it to me, OK!"

Fei
"That Hammer..."

Citan
"......
We should make
a move too."

Fei
"... This room!?
This is the Champ's...?"

Rue
"Yes, the room given to 
the Champion... 
Is it not to your
satisfaction?"

Fei
"No, it's not that.
What about Rico...?"

Rue
"... Rico?
He's the 'ex-Champion'...
Now you are 'the Champion'!"

Fei
"But, what happened
to him...?"

Rue
"After the Finals League,
during the group league
bouts, his Gear went out
of control.
The out of control Gear
crashed into the Kaiser's
box seat, and was damaged.
Nothing has been heard
from the former Champion,
Ricardo, and no one has seen
him since the incident..."

Fei
"......"

Rue
"There are no Battling
competitions for a while
so you can rest up a bit.
The explosive collar has
been removed.
How about taking a walk
around 'A Block' - the
civilian area of Nortune?"

Fei
"...'A Block'...
civilian area?"

Rue
"The southeast part of
the Imperial capital...
It is called A Block or the
ordinary civilian area..."

Rue
"Well then, we shall
take our leave..."

Fei
"So... what do you
want with us?"

Amazoness
"The Champ...no I mean...
Rico needs your help."

Citan
"Help the Champion...?"

Fei
"Hang on,
what do you mean?"

Battler
"Y'know what just happened...
The special broadcast on the
dorm's vid by the Committee!"

Battler
"Yeah, y'know, the broadcast
said somthin' like this...
This evening, the former
Champion was found guilty
of attempting to assassinate
the Kaiser, as well as
breaking Imperial Code
section B..."

Thus, a public execution
will be held at the arena..."

Fei
"Yes, I know he got caught,
and was arrested...
But, what's this about an
attempted assassination
of the Kaiser!?"

Battler
"Those committee members...
The Champ probably got in
their way somehow..."

Citan
"...The Battling
Committee?"

Amazoness
"The Battling Committee is
made up mostly of people
from the 'Ethos'.
They used to have a lot of
pull in the government...
But the current Kaiser,
Sigmund, ousted almost all
of the 'Ethos' influence
from the government."

Battler
"On top of that, these
past few years...
In order to strengthen the
military or something, the
Kaiser has started to
interfere with the Battling
operated by the 'Ethos'."

Battler
"The Kaiser probably got in
the way of them operating
the Battling smoothly.
So, they used the Champ..."

Fei
"Why Rico...?"

Amazoness
"Rico was originally
born in this town...
But because Sigmund whipped
up anti-demihuman sentiment
Rico was chased out of this
town when he was young."

Amazoness
"So Rico hated the Kaiser,
the capital Nortune, and
the whole Kislev Empire."

Fei
"And that's why they
went after Rico..."

Battler
"In the past, the Champ has
had many chances to kill
the Kaiser.
That the earlier crash into
the box seat was disguised
as an accident..."

Amazoness
"But that failed too.
The committee, fearing
being exposed, used
Rico..."

Battler
"The Champ is being
manipulated by the
committee.
Please, Fei!
Help the Champ."

Battler
"Now, you are the
Battling Champ, but
our Champ is...

Hammer
"...Wha?
Hey bro, what are you
doing talking with them?"

Fei
"Hold on a minute.
Hammer, tell me about 
those supply trains."

Hammer
"Huh?
Is it...alright?
With these outsiders...?"

Citan
"It is alright,
they are our friends."

Hammer
"Oh, really?
Well, okay...
The next supply train's
operating date is...
tonight!
But...
if that's too soon,
then the next one is..."

Fei
"Hammer, did you say that
a supply train will pass
by here tonight?"

Hammer
"What? Tonight?
Well there are trains
passing through...
Um, but bro...
we need a thorough plan.
Tonight is impossible!"

Fei
"The situation has changed,
and so have our plans.
We move tonight!!"

Hammer
"We move tonight...?
What the...?
Are you serious?"

Citan
"... Did you hear any
interesting tidbits of
information outside?"

Hammer
"Well...the dorms are in
an uproar over that Master
Rico thing..."

Citan
"Do you know any details?
Rico is to be executed at
the arena, tonight, right?"

Hammer
"Master Rico's going
to be executed...
is this true?"

Fei
"Didn't you say there
was one more route?"

Hammer
"Huh? Oh yeah, you mean
via the arena, right...
Bro! You're not thinking..."

Fei
"Yes I am thinking
exactly that!
You said it may be
possible to get out 
through the Battling 
Arena, right?"

Citan
"I see! Then we 
probably can help
the Champion..."

Fei
"Doc."

Citan
"Hmm...
It might just work!"

Hammer
"Wait a minute!
Might just work...?
You don't intend to
just go bursting into
the arena, do you?"

Fei
"Either way, we were going
to escape via the arena, so
it's on our way... right!?"

Amazoness
"Then that means...?"

Fei
"No problem. It's just one
more thing to do on the way
to getting my Gear back..."

Citan
"Leave the rest to us.
And I would like you all to
go to the arena tonight.
We will leave Nortune, but
if they think you were all
involved with us, I do not
know what they might do..."

Battler
"We're counting on you
...for the Champ's sake."

Amazoness
"Sorry, we had to ask
you to do this..."

Battler
"We really appreciate 
what you're doing...
Here...
Please take this."

Received 2000G!

Hammer
"The supply train times,
dates and destinations!
I got them all... no prob!"

Fei
"Hammer, you hide
yourself somewhere.
When we get out into the
arena, I'm just going to
go wild in my Gear...
We'll play it by ear from
there to escape from the
Imperial capital...
You got it, Hammer?"

Hammer
"I got you, bro!
Show them your stuff
for me too, bro!"

...I can rest here.
    Don't
    Rest

Citan
"No time for that.
We must hurry..."

Citan
"Hold on, Fei.
Are you fully prepared?
You know there is no
turning back now."

Fei
"Huh? Yeah, you're right."
    Go get prepped
    I'm ready 

Citan
"...Good.
Shall we go?
There is not much time."

Citan
"...There is still some
time before the train
arrives... Let us rest
here for a while."

My son has gone...
And when tomorrow comes,
my daughter will leave
our home.

......sigh...

...I should've known
it was a mistake.

...Huh? Who might you
be? That's awfully rude
to come in my home.
I guess it'd be useless 
to tell this to a
criminal... Now, please
leave.

Sigh...

I guess it was a mistake
to build my dream home in
D Block even though it
was dirt cheap...

Aside from my son, my
daughter's only 5...
She won't be leaving for
a long time. Always so
worried...

It's true that this
house itself isn't bad...
But was it really
necessary to build it in
this prison block?

I'm finally an
imperial soldier. I was
a burden on my parents.
But I'll make it up to
them by working hard.
Someday, I'm gonna live
in A Block.

And get a beautiful
bride...and a close
family...Hey! What're
you making me say!?

Hrnoww, me eyes're
spinnin'. Everyone's
turnin'... Nope.

They only let me out
when we go to church on
the weekends...I'm bored
cooped up in the house.
I wish I could go and play
with the church folk.

Boring, boring.
I'm soooo bored!

here for a while.
Let's not waste time, bro,
care to to make a purchase?"
    Not now!
    'spose I have to.

Hammer
"Oh yeah, and while I'm 
here I deal in Gear parts
instead of accessories."

Hammer
"Yeah! That's my bro!
You're too kind man!
Much appreciated!"

Hammer
"What you be needin' bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's Gear parts

Hammer
"The procedures were quite
sudden so the approval for
servicing Gear parts won't
make it in time for the 
first bouts.
Oh and bro, you haven't 
been allocated a Gear yet.
...I wonder what Gear they
will give you...?"

Hammer
"Thanks bro, but how about
buying something else apart
from items?
It'll help Hammer out too!
    Enough already!
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's Gear Parts

Hammer
"OK, now for the Battling.
Do your best, bro!
For Hammer's future t..."

Hammer
"OK, now for the Battling.
Do your best, bro.!
For Hammer's future t..."

!?

Hammer
"Forget it!"

Hammer
"The procedures were quite
sudden so the approval for
servicing Gear parts won't
make it in time for the
first bouts.
Oh and bro, you haven't
been allocated a Gear yet.
...I wonder what Gear they
will provide you with...?"

Citan
"...Or the reception
area to be exact."

Receptionist
"This year's Imperial Games
are held over 5 days. The
first 3 days are decided 
with a 2 match victory...
The qualifiers go on to
compete in the second and
third days' bouts...
Those who win 3 battles in
the semi-final bouts on the
fourth day, qualify for the
last-day's Finals League."

Receptionist
"By the way, Fei, sir, your
opponents in today's matches
are...Leonardo Sniper in the
first bout...
and if you win against him 
then for the second bout you
fight...Heinrich Clive."

Receptionist
"Your entry has already been
made. Please follow the
supervisor's instructions to
compete in your first bout."

Receptionist
"Due to sudden mechanical
trouble, your competitor for
yesterday, Leonardo Sniper,
has had to drop out...
Heinrich Clive has also had
mechanical problems and has
pulled out. This means you,
Fei, win by default and can
compete in day 2's bouts!"

Receptionist
"If you win 2 matches today,
the second day of the games,
you can progress on to the
third set of bouts.
Do you want to enter the 
bouts for day two?"
    Don't enter
    Let me Enter!

Receptionist
"It's the last bout for day
two. Win this to qualify for
day three's bouts.
Do you want to enter the 
day's final bout?"
    Don't enter
    Go for it!

Receptionist
"Today is the third day of
the games. Win 2 bouts and
you qualify for tomorrow's
semi-finals.
Do you want to enter day
three's bouts?"
    Don't enter
    Let me at'em!

Receptionist
"It's the last bout for day
three. Win this to qualify
for tomorrow's semi-finals.
Do you wish to enter the
day's final bout?"
    Don't enter
    Let's do it!

Receptionist
"Today's the semi-finals.
Win 3 matches to qualify
for the Finals League.
Do you want to enter the
semi-finals?
    Don't enter
    Give it a try

Receptionist
"...2 matches to win before
you qualify for tomorrow's
Finals League."
Enter the second bout of 
the semi-finals?
    Don't enter
    I'll enter!

Receptionist
"It's the last bout of the
day! Win this to qualify
for the Finals League!
Do you want to enter the
day's final bout?"
    Don't enter
    'course I'll enter!

Receptionist
"Today's the last day of the
games...The Finals League!
You get to challenge...
 Ricardo Banderas !!! "
Do you desire to enter the
Finals League?
    Don't enter
    Let me at him!

Receptionist
"I have confirmed the entry
of pilot 'Fei'. 
One moment please..."

The Gear 'Weltall'
has been sent to
the storage paddock.
Standby for boarding!

Pilot Fei, please proceed to
the competitor's paddock!

Informationist
"Okeydokey!
Well then, I'll now explain
a bit about 'Battling'."

Informationist
"Battling is the sport of
fighting one-on-one with
Gears and is held in the
Imperial capital's arena.
The rules of the sport are
simple - fight until one or
the other breaks down.
In other words, just bash
your rival to pieces!
But you don't have to fight
till you trash your Gear.
You are allowed to give up
during a match...so if you
can't win...well, you know!"

Informationist
"Well that's the rough
explanation...I guess.
Did you get the drift?

Fei
"Well, errh..."
    Sure, no problem!
    Sorry I don't get it!

Informationist
"The next thing to do is to
gain experience by actually
Battling. The key is to
get used to the controls!
But perhaps jumping straight
into an actual battle is too
much for you? Well then, why
not try our 'practice mode'
for help with the controls?
This is a simulation mode
where you can practice the
basic control methods.
We recommend that beginners
should train here first!
Also, there is a 'tutorial
mode' that provides easy 
lessons, from the basic 
controls through to an 
explanation of the screen."

Informationist
"Is there anything else you
want to ask about?"

Informationist
"Huh? You didn't understand?
That's strange! Well, once
again from the beginning...
(Gee and I thought this guy
had it in him? ...Obviously I
was wrong... Is his head OK?)
Anyway, listen closely now!"

Informationist
"Right, the basic controls!
Well, what do you want to do?
    Ask about button controls
    Tutorial Mode
    Practice Mode
    Ask about something else

Informationist
"Okay, the button controls.
I'll explain each button's
functions accordingly...

Informationist
"Well, I'll now explain the
basic control methods using
the actual screen."

Informationist
"So, you want to try out the
actual controls, huh..."

Informationist
"Oh, well...have your way!
What else do you want to
enquire about?"

"Which button do you need
an explanation of?
    Directional button
    <X> button
    <S> button
    <T> button
    <C> button
    Next page

"Which shall I explain to
you about?"
    L1 button
    R1 button
    Start button
    Back to first page
    End explanation

Informationist
"Oh...had enough already?
Anything else you need to
know? Don't be afraid now!

Informationist
"...Oh, is that how it is?
Well, is there anything else
you want to inquire about?"

Informationist
"O.K., about the Directional
button...assuming that your
opponent is on your right
(from your viewpoint) then:
= UP moves your Gear back
 away from the screen.
= DOWN moves your Gear in
 towards the screen.
= RIGHT moves your Gear
 towards your opponent.
= LEFT moves your Gear
 away from your opponent.

Informationist
"Lastly, when you're close
to your opponent, pressing
LEFT invokes a special move
momentary back acceleration!
This momentarily distances
you from your opponent (or
allows you to 'run away')!
Just remember the opposite
direction to your opponent.

Informationist
"That's it in a nutshell!
It's probably easier to get
the idea by actually trying
your hand at the controls!"

Informationist
"The <X> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <X> is one of them.)
It changes from Gear to Gear
but is mainly meant for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three long!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can use!"

Informationist
"The <S> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <S> is one of them.)
It differs from Gear to Gear
but is mainly utilized for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three in length!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can try out!"

Informationist
"The <T> button is for JUMP!
Your movement controls are
the same during jumps.
Also, you are able to attack
with the <X> and <S> buttons
during jumps!
Oh, and it's alright to use
the R1 button to make Ether
Bullet attacks too!

Informationist
"The <C> button is for DASH.
Your movement controls are
the same as usual.
The only thing is that you
cannot continue running
indefinitely."

Informationist
"For more details, try
the 'Tutorial Mode', where
you'll get an explanation 
from a different official."

Informationist
"Attacking isn't everything!
Although it is said that 
'offense is the best form
of defense', at times it is
important to defend oneself.
That's why we have the L1 
button to GUARD you!  But, 
it doesn't prevent all of 
the damage so be careful!"

Informationist
"The R1 button launches a 
special attack called 'Ether 
Bullet'. It's good for long
range attacks on your foe!
'Ether Bullets' have homing
ability so you may tend to
rely on them, but you might
regret it if you use them 
too much! Do be careful!"

Informationist
"For more details, try our 
'Tutorial Mode', where you
will get an explanation from
a different official."

Informationist
"The Start button will
permit you to pause the
battle.
At this time, you may select
the 'GIVE UP' option if you 
think you won't win."

Informationist
"What shall I explain?"
    Battling
    Basic controls
    I'm alright thanks!

Informationist
"...Fei, sir, you haven't
registered your Gear yet.
But I can explain the basic
controls if you like...?

Fei
"Battling control method?"
    Please explain
    No need, thanks

Informationist
"Oh, well...have your way!
What else do you want to
enquire about?"

Informationist
"Yes, I thought you wouldn't
have any problems! Anyway,
give it your best shot, now!

Informationist
"...You finally made it to
the Battling Finals League!
Come'on now! You can do it!"

Informationist
"Only a little way to go to
the Battling Finals League!
With your ability, you just
might become 'Battling
Champion'! Good Luck!

Informationist
"...Are you sure you don't
need to hear what I've got
to say? If you have trouble
don't blame it on me!"

Informationist
"What shall I explain?"
    Battling
    Basic controls
    I'm alright thanks!

Receptionist
"Here's the prize money paid
to winners of a Battling 
bout. It's well earned!"

Rico's Henchman
"Hey, your machine has been
rigged! I'm gonna tell the
Committee on you!"

Rico's Henchman
"Yeah, he's definitely had
his Gear equipped with parts
that are in violation of the
rules, or somethin'!"

Rico
"Shut up!!"

Rico
"...Don't embarrass me any
further...
How could such special parts
exist in the Imperial
capital anyway!?
Especially since you can't
leave the Imperial Capital 
with these collars on!"

Rico's Henchman
"B,b,but,
Rico...then...!?

Rico
"I thought I told you to 
stop! ...Keep quiet!"

Hammer
"That's right!
It's impossible!
Bro won on his
own strength!
Stop trying to trump up
false accusations!

Rico's Henchman
"Uh...bro..."

Fei
"Enough already, Hammer!"

Fei
"I won because of luck... 
and because I had a good 
teacher!"

Fei
"...Also the wound to your 
arm hasn't completely healed
yet, has it?
If it wasn't for that wound
I am sure you would have
won instead..."

Rico
"Defeat is defeat... 
My wound is no excuse. The
Battling Champion is...you!"

Fei
"......... "

Rico
"...Well, I have something 
I must see to. I'll be off
now."

Rico's Henchman
"Champ! Wait up!
Let us go with you..."

Rico
"I am no longer the champ!
You guys will just get in my
way! Don't follow me! OK!?"

Rico's Henchman
"In your way...? But Champ!"

Rico's Henchman
"...Ri-co--!"

Hammer
"This means I am acquitted!
I am cleared! 
Oh, how the free world
outside beckons us!"

Rico
"...Don't give me that!
Your strength...?
Is that your attitude?"

Fei
"......... "

Rico
"C'mon, fight me again!
You seemed a lot stronger
in the sewers!
Show me your true strength!"

Rico
"...Don't give me that!
What are you scared of?"

Fei
"......... "

Rico
"C'mon man, fight me again!
You seemed a lot stronger
in those sewers!
Show me your true strength!"

Hammer
"Yo, Bro~!
You forgot your mechanic!
Wait up a little!"

Rue
"Welcome to the Battling
Arena...
Fei, Sir...
Several days ago you were
adamant about not piloting
Gears...
Has something happened in 
the last few days to make
you change your mind in
such a large way?"

Fei
"Well, I have my reasons.
For starters, you can't say 
prison life is that easy."

Fei
"...And then there's the 
matter of personal safety!"

Fei
"Living the rest of my life
with sewer monsters is not 
that bad...
it's just, well,
...there are many factors."

Fei
"Then there's this collar!
It gets in the way so much!"

Rue
"Your collar...?"

Rue
"Hahahmm...
You're amusing!
Are you intending to aim for
victory despite it being 
your first try at Battling?"

Fei
"...Is that strange?"

Rue
"No, no! Not the least...
Please excuse me!
You seem to have quite some
confidence in fighting with
Gears...
I'm looking forward to..."

!?

Rue
"Oops...excuse me!
Well, I guess I'll show you
the way to the paddocks.
We don't have much time..."

Fei
"The paddocks...?"

Rue
"What, you're thinking that
you're going to fight with
flesh and blood?
...Hahahmm, not that I 
wouldn't mind seeing it, 
but..."

Rue
"We told you before that
the committee would prepare
a machine for you...
What did you forget?"

Fei
"Oh, err...
The Gear I'm going to pilot
will be, err..."

Rue
"Well, come on now.
Walk this way..."

Citan
"Hold on! We are not
ready yet... Can you
spare us a little time?"

Rue
"...Understood. But we don't
have much time to spare, so
please hurry up now..."

Rue
"Report to the officials.
Pilot confirmation complete.
Suggest first bout opponent
to be the black Gear..."

Hammer
"You finished the day's
Battling safely, hey, bro?
Why not return to your
quarters and rest up a bit?
Or you could buy something!"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's Gear parts
    I'm alright for now!

Hammer
"Hey hey! Thanks again man!
That warms me pockets! So...
are you heading back now?"

Hammer
"Hey hey! Thanks again man!
That warms me pockets! So...
are you heading back now?"

Hammer
"Well then, no use
hanging around.
We'd better head
back to our lodgings as 
early as possible.
After all that exercise,
the best thing for you
is to go beddy-byes!
You had better
sleep off the day's fatigue,
cause tommorow's a big day!"

Hammer
"Bro, you did it! You won!
You're the Battling Champ!
...or, close enough anyway!
Victory is in reach! If you
just win tomorrow's Finals
League we'll have our names
cleared and be released!"

Fei
"But Hammer, you know my 
opponent is no pushover!
His power is incredible...
He's been Battling Champion
for three years straight!
Beating him's going to be
no easy task...
Up till today I've managed
to win somehow, but
tomorrow is another matter!
I doubt that I will win."

Hammer
"...If that's your attitude
you'll lose even if you
could've won!
Come on bro,
show some fighting spirit!"

Fei
"...Hahaha, I didn't think
you'd be the type to say
something like that!"

Fei
"You're right!
I'll never win with these
pre-battle blues.
Thanks Hammer!
Well then, let's head back
to our lodgings now."

Hammer
"I'd like to be able to say
'no problem', but tomorrow's
Finals League is important!
Don't you think you should
take care in servicing and
customizing your Gear?
Our fates depend on it!"

Fei
"...Gear servicing, heh?
Leaving it just to one
mechanic worries me a bit.
I'll ask the doc to give
us a hand also!"

Hammer
"A bit of a worry!?
That's not so Bro! 
This here mechanic is doing
the best he can, y'know!

Fei
"I didn't mean it that way,
so don't get all upset now,
Hammer!
Anyway, let's go back to 
our barracks and call the 
doc, shall we!?"

Hammer
"Wait! Don't you think you 
should save your Battling
record in the 'Memory Cube'!

Fei
"I suppose I should..."

Hammer
"Oh and bro! You did save
your Battling record in the
'Memory Cube' didn't you?"

Receptionist
"Match forfeited!"

Receptionist
"Hmm, not a bad battle!
Keep up the good work!"

Receptionist
"Wow, you're sooo strooong!
Boy, was he ever outmatched!
Ooh, I get pins and needles
at your overwhelming power!"

Receptionist
"So this is what they mean
by 'taking great risks'?
Well done on a close win!"

Receptionist
"Too bad, you lose! It was
not due to any obvious flaw,
so you might win next time.

Receptionist
"I'll give you some advice!
You're not limited to just
the <X> and <S> button's
physical attacks!
There is another attack work
called 'Ether Bullets' that
are useful on distant foes.
They are simple to use, just
press the 'R1 button', OK!"

Receptionist
"Right, just remember to
press the 'R1 button' to
shoot 'Ether Bullets'!
This will increase your
chances of winning for 
sure! (...or so we hope!?)"

Receptionist
"Attacking while jumping
is awesome! Master it!"

Receptionist
"One weakness that I can see
from watching your bout is
that you seem to use your
'Ether Bullets' too much.
You should better understand
the nature of the attack...
'Ether Bullets' raise your
'Heat Gauge (H.G.)' by quite
a large percentage.
Three shots will easily send
your H.G. to the MAX 
condition. If you continue 
to attack in that condition,
your machine overheats.
The excess heat begins to
cause damage, so if you
don't take care, your HP
will fall to zero before
you realize it!"

Receptionist
"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen H.G..
Manage your heat during
battle with the aid of 
this H.G.. Oh, and don't
forget to stay cool now!"

Receptionist
"The main cause of your loss
is this: your over-reliance
on 'Dash' movement! Simply
put, you run round too much!
Dashing about may be a good
strategy but you'll notice
that the 'Heat Gauge (H.G.)'
which shows your Gear's heat
level, climbs much faster!
You can continue to DASH
even after your H.G. reaches
the MAX condition, but as 
your Gear overheats more and
more, it will cause damage!
If you don't take care, then
your H.P. will fall to zero,
and before you know it, you
will lose the use of both
'Dash' and 'Ether Bullets'!"

Receptionist
"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen H.G..
Manage your heat during
battle with the aid of 
this H.G.. Oh, and don't
forget to keep cool now!"

Receptionist
"...You do realize why you
lost don't you? If not then
I'll tell you if you want!"

Receptionist
"Want to know why you lost?"
    No I don't!
    Of course I do!

Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the 'R1 button'
to shoot 'Ether bullets'.
'Ether Bullets' are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!
Second is your over-use of
'Dash movement'. The use of
either of these when your
'Heat Gauge' is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!
Whilever your overheating,
you will be taking damage,
so if you're not careful,
before you know it, your 
H.P. will fall to zero!"

Receptionist
"The point is the over-use
of either ability is bad 
for your Gear!
"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen 'Heat Gauge'.
Refer to this Heat Gauge
(H.G.) to help you manage
your heat during battle.
'Keep your cool'!"

Receptionist
"...Knowing the reasons for
your defeat will help you to
fight better next time!"

Receptionist
"Obviously the Gears were
unevenly matched...!
Or was it the pilots?
Sorry to say this to you, 
but either-way, your not 
much of an opponent!"

Receptionist
"Practice makes perfect! 
We recommend our 'Practice 
Mode' to you. Try it today!"

Receptionist
"So near yet so far! 
Too bad!
You almost had him!"

Receptionist
"That was a good match! 
Either of you could have 
easily won! Now try harder 
to win on the rebound!"

Receptionist
"...Are you a pacifist?
...Or don't know how to 
control a Gear?
You need to know the basic
controls, so perhaps you 
should try out our Practice 
Mode! Speak to the girl at 
the counter next to me."

Receptionist
"You can't just do nothing
and expect to win!
You need to practice first 
to get the hang of it!"

Gate Keeper
"Beyond here is the 
competitors' Gear storage 
paddock.
Sorry, but to prevent pilots
cheating, unauthorized entry
is not permitted."

Informationist
"Nothing learned nothing 
gained. Ask and you shall
receive...perhaps.
Anyway, 'Battler', what do
you need to know about the
Battling Contest?"

Informationist
"What shall I explain?"
    What's Battling?
    Basic control method?
    I'm alright thanks!

BP-Exchanger Girl
"What can I do for you?"
    Current Battle Points
    What are Battle Points?
    Item Exchange
    Nothing thanks!

CURRENT BP:
TOTAL   BP:

BP-Exchanger Girl
"Battle Points are what you
earn each time you win a
battle. 
There are two types of
records kept.
First, 
'Current BP'
This represents the current 
number of Battle Points you 
have obtained.
You are able to exchange
'Current BP' for prizes
such as items. 
When you make an exchange,
the appropriate number of
points will be deducted.
Second,
'Total BP'
This represents the total
amount of battle points you
have collected up to now.
'Total BP' aren't normally
affected when you exchange
items. Also when your 'Total
BP' reach set values you can
exchange them for a variety
of 'Rare Items'.
But remember: caveat emptor!
Not everything is so simple!
There are also prizes that
reduce your "Total BP" too!
So pay attention when making 
exchanges!
In those cases, it might be
better to choose prizes that
don't reduce your Total BP.
...But then again, if you 
want something really bad...
well anyway, it's up to you!

"Here's the 'Item Exchange
Menu'... Make your choice!"
    About Item Exchanges...
    Normal Item Exchange
    Rare Item Exchange
    I've changed my mind!

BP-Exchanger Girl
"During Normal Item Exchange
you can exchange the Battle
Points you earned from
Battling for a variety of
items, Gear parts, etc.
It is an 'exchange', so when
you do trade-in your points,
naturally those points will
be deducted!"

BP-Exchanger Girl
"Once you select the item 
you want to exchange points
for, apart from defective 
items, we offer no refunds!
So take care in choosing!"

BP-Exchanger Girl
"The other exchange is for
rare items. When your total
points reach a certain level
you are presented with these
items.
The items prepared for you
cannot be found anywhere
else, so are quite valuable.
That is also why you can 
only acquire one of each!"

BP-Exchanger Girl

Informationist
"Okeydokey!
Well then, I'll now explain
a bit about 'Battling'."

Informationist
"Battling is the sport of
fighting one-on-one with
Gears and is held at the 
Imperial Capital's arena.
The format of the sport is
simple - fight until one or
the other breaks down. 
In other words, just bash
your rival to pieces!
But you don't have to fight
till you trash your Gear.
You are allowed to give up
during a match...so if you
can't win...well, you know!
Finally, the armor values
of Gears during the battling
bouts are made uniform, so
that competitors can fight
on equal terms.
In other words, competitors
must rely fully on the
fundamental properties
of the Gears they pilot."

Informationist
"Well that's the quick
rundown...I think.
Did you get the drift?

<Perso1>
"Well, errh..."
    Sure, no problem!
    Sorry I don't get it!

Informationist
"The next thing to do is to
gain experience by actually
Battling. The key is to
get used to the controls!
But perhaps jumping straight
into an actual battle is too
much for you? Well then, why
not try our 'practice mode'
for help with the controls?
This is a simulation mode
where you can practice the
basic control methods.
We recommend that beginners
should train here first!
Also, there is a 'tutorial
mode' that provides easy 
lessons, from the basic 
controls through to an 
explanation of the screen."

Informationist
"Is there anything else you
want to ask about?"

Informationist
"Huh? You didn't understand?
That's strange! Well, once
again from the beginning...
(Gee and I thought this guy
had it in him? ...Obviously I
was wrong... Is his head OK?)
Anyway, listen closely now!"

Informationist
"Right, the basic controls!
Well what do you want to do?
    Ask about button controls
    Tutorial Mode
    Practice Mode
    Ask about something else

Informationist
"Right, the button controls.
I'll explain each button's
function accordingly...

Informationist
"Well, I'll now explain the
basic control methods using
the actual screen."

Informationist
"So, you want to try out the
actual controls, huh..."

Informationist
"Oh, well...have it your way!
What else do you want to
enquire about?"

"Which button do you need
an explanation of?
    Directional button
    <X> button
    <S> button
    <T> button
    <C> button
    Next page

"Which shall I explain to
you about?"
    L1 button
    R1 button
    Start button
    Back to first page
    End explanation

Informationist
"Oh...had enough already?
Anything else you need to
know? Don't be afraid now!

Informationist
"O.K., about the Directional
button... Assuming that your
opponent is on your right
(from your viewpoint) then:
= UP moves your Gear back
 away from the screen.
= DOWN moves your Gear in
 towards the screen.
= RIGHT moves your Gear
 towards your opponent.
= LEFT moves your Gear
 away from your opponent.

Informationist
"Lastly, when you're close
to your opponent, pressing
LEFT invokes a special move
momentary back acceleration!
This momentarily distances
you from your opponent (or
allows you to 'run away')!
Just remember the opposite
direction to your opponent.

Informationist
"That's it in a nutshell!
It's probably easier to get
the idea by actually trying
your hand at the controls!"

Informationist
"The <X> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <X> is one of them.)
It changes from Gear to Gear
but is mainly meant for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three long!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can use!"

Informationist
"The <S> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <S> is one of them.)
It differs from Gear to Gear
but is mainly utilized for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three in length!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can try out!"

Informationist
"The <T> button is for JUMP!
Your movement controls are
the same during jumps.
Also, you are able to attack
with the <X> and <S> buttons
during jumps!
Oh, and it's alright to use
the R1 button to make Ether
Bullet attacks too!

Informationist
"The <C> button is for DASH.
Your movement controls are
the same as usual.
The only thing is that you
cannot continue running
indefinitely."

Informationist
"For more details, try
the 'Tutorial Mode', where
you'll get an explanation 
from a different official."

Informationist
"Attacking isn't everything!
Although it is said that 
'offense is the best form
of defense', at times it is
important to defend oneself.
That's why we have the L1 
button to GUARD you!  But, 
it doesn't prevent all of 
the damage so be careful!"

Informationist
"The R1 button launches a 
special attack called 'Ether 
Bullet'. It's good for long
range attacks on your foe!
'Ether Bullets' have homing
ability so you may tend to
rely on them, but you might
regret it if you use them 
too much! Do be careful!"

Informationist
"For more details, try our 
'Tutorial Mode', where you
will get an explanation from
a different official."

Informationist
"The Start button will
permit you to pause the
battle.
At this time, you may select
the 'GIVE UP' option if you 
think you won't win."

Informationist
"Yes, I thought you wouldn't
have any problems! Anyway,
give it your best shot now!"

the Empire of Kislev and

field far to the south...
It's 'the last stand of the
living'!"

Amazoness
"I abandoned this place
once, but it's the city
in which I was born!
I can't turn my back on
it that easily!
That's why I came back...

Imperial Capital.
Even if destruction was to
come on this world, I'd go
on protecting it!

Former Imperial City Guard

day was...an angel...a, a

I, I am a soldier of the

And yet, ...and yet, ...and
yet, I could do nothing!!!
Damn it! ...Damn everything!"

Big Joe
"Destruction was poured out
onto our entire world...
Death poured down on all 
the living...
It was fate,
unavoidable fate!

Big Joe
Allow me to show my 
appreciations for all 
you have done fellas.
I brought this here from the
Wildcat bar in what was the
Imperial capital Nortune.
I also fixed it up a little.
It should be a lot more
friendlier now. But you'll
never know unless you try,
so give it a listen, huh!
It was hard to get rid of
the elegant old grain look
it had when placed in the
'Wildcat', but...
well, anyway, don't you
think the new faux marble
design is kinda groovy?"

Big Joe
"Brought this from the empty
remains of the bar in the 
Imperial Capital Nortune.
The outside was damaged, 
so I had to change it...
It was hard to get rid of
the elegant old grain look.
But, anyway, don't you
think the new faux marble
design is kinda groovy? Now,
if only I had an 'M disk'!
You can listen to 'M disks'
with this, but I gave my
'M disk' to the girlies in
the old Imperial Capital.
It was a valuable premium
disk refined with Ether
logic too!
If only I had known... !"

Receptionist
"Match forfeited!"

Receptionist
"Hmm, not a bad battle!
Keep it up!"

Receptionist
"Wow, you're sooo strooong!
Boy, was he ever outmatched!
Ooh, I get goose bumps
at your overwhelming power!"

Receptionist
"So this is what they mean
by 'taking great risks'?
Well done on a close win!"

Receptionist
"Too bad, you lose! It was
not due to any obvious flaw,
so you might win next time.

Receptionist
"I'll give you some advice!
You're not limited to just
the <X> and <S> button's
physical attacks!
There is another attack form
called 'Ether Bullets' that
are useful on distant foes.
They are simple to use, just
press the 'R1 button', OK!"

Receptionist
"Right, just remember to
press the 'R1 button' to
shoot 'Ether Bullets'!
This will increase your
chances of winning for 
sure! (...or so we hope!?)"

Receptionist
"Attacking while jumping
is awesome! Master it!"

Receptionist
"One weakness that I can see
from watching your bout is 
that you seem to use your 
'Ether Bullets' too much.
You should better understand
the nature of the attack...
'Ether Bullets' raise your
'Heat Gauge (H.G.)' by quite
a large percentage.
Three shots will easily send
your H.G. to the MAX 
condition. If you continue 
to attack in that condition,
your machine overheats.
The excess heat begins to
cause damage, so if you
don't take care, your HP
will fall to zero before
you realize it!"

Receptionist
"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen H.G..
Manage your heat during
battle with the aid of 
this H.G.. Oh, and don't
forget to stay cool now!"

Receptionist
"The main cause of your loss
is this: your over-reliance
on 'Dash' movement! Simply
put, you run round too much!
Dashing about may be a good
strategy but you'll notice
that the 'Heat Gauge (H.G.)'
which shows your Gear's heat
level, climbs much faster!
You can continue to DASH
even after your H.G. reaches
the MAX condition, but as 
your Gear overheats more and
more, it will cause damage!
If you don't take care, then
your H.P. will fall to zero,
and before you know it, you
will lose the use of both
'Dash' and 'Ether Bullets'!"

Receptionist
"The heat accumulated by

"...You do realize why you
lost don't you? If not then
I'll tell you if you want!"

Receptionist
"Want to know why you lost?"
    No, I don't!
    Of course I do!

Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the 'R1 button'
to shoot 'Ether bullets'.
'Ether Bullets' are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!
Second is your over-use of
'Dash movement'. The use of
either of these when your
'Heat Gauge' is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!
Whilever your overheating,
you will be taking damage,
so if you're not careful,
before you know it, your 
H.P. will fall to zero!"

Receptionist
"The point is the over-use
of either ability is bad 
for your Gear!
The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen 'Heat Gauge'.
Refer to this Heat Gauge
(H.G.) to help you manage
your heat during battle.
'Keep your cool'!"

Receptionist
"...knowing the reasons for
your defeat will help you to
fight better next time!"

Receptionist
"Obviously the Gears were
unevenly matched...!
Or was it the pilots?
Sorry to say this to you, 
but either-way, your not 
much of an opponent!"

Receptionist
"Practice makes perfect! 
We recommend our 'Practice 
Mode' to you. Try it today!"

Receptionist
"So near yet so far! 
Too bad!
You almost had him!"

Receptionist
"That was a good match! 
Either of you could have 
easily won! Now try harder 
to win on the rebound!"

Receptionist
"...Are you a pacifist?
...Or don't you know how to 
control a Gear?
You need to know the basic
controls, so perhaps you 
should try out our Practice 
Mode! Speak to the girl at 
the counter next to me."

Receptionist
"You can't just do nothing
and expect to win!
You need to practice first 
to get the hang of it!"

actual controls, huh..."

Informationist
"O.K., about the Directional
button...assuming that your
opponent is on your right
(from your viewpoint) then:
= UP moves your Gear back
 away from the screen.
= DOWN moves your Gear in
 towards the screen.
= RIGHT moves your Gear
 towards your opponent.
= LEFT moves your Gear
 away from your opponent.

Informationist
"Lastly, when you're close
to your opponent, pressing
LEFT invokes a special move
momentary back acceleration!
This momentarily distances
you from your opponent (or
allows you to 'run away')!
Just remember the opposite
direction to your opponent.

Informationist
"That's it in a nutshell!
It's probably easier to get
the idea by actually trying
your hand at the controls!"

Informationist
"The <X> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <X> is one of them.)
It changes from Gear to Gear
but is mainly meant for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three long!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can use!"

Informationist
"The <S> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <S> is one of them.)
It differs from Gear to Gear
but is mainly utilized for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three in length!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can try out!"

Informationist
"The <T> button is for JUMP!
Your movement controls are
the same during jumps.
Also, you are able to attack
with the <X> and <S> buttons
during jumps!
Oh, and it's alright to use
the R1 button to make Ether
Bullet attacks too!

Informationist
"The <C> button is for DASH.
Your movement controls are
the same as usual.
The only thing is that you
cannot continue running
indefinitely."

Informationist

the 'Tutorial Mode', where
you'll get an explanation 
from a different official."

Informationist
"Attacking isn't everything!
Although it is said that 
'offense is the best form
of defense', at times it is
important to defend oneself.
That's why we have the L1
button to GUARD you!  But, 
it doesn't prevent all of
the damage so be careful!"

Informationist
"The R1 button launches a 
special attack called 'Ether 
Bullet'. It's good for long
range attacks on your foe!
'Ether Bullets' have homing
ability so you may tend to
rely on them, but you might
regret it if you use them 
too much! Do be careful!"

Informationist
"For more details, try our 
'Tutorial Mode', where you

Compared to the Champ's
Gear, the quality just
does not match up."

Hammer
"There's nothing we can do.
Master Rico's Gear is a
special make of Gear
provided by the Committee.
From maintainence to parts,
it receives the best of
everything.
As long as money is
involved, the Champ will go
all out.
That's one of the reasons
he's so powerful..."

No matter how high
quality your Gear may
be, you won't be able
to defeat him."

Wiseman fights Fei - file75

Fei
"Why do you suddenly
want to fight for? Are
you crazy or something?"

Fei
"Whoa!"

Fei
"Y, you're
serious?"

Fei
"Ugh uhh... That's the
same technique as me...!
How come...?"

Wiseman
"Enough talk!
Take this...!"

Wiseman
"Of course!
So put up a
good fight!
Cause if you
don't your life
is mine!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wiseman
"Fighting brute strength
with brute strength is a
sign of a great fool.
It's obvious that a lighter
body such as yours will
always be at a disadvantage
in a head-on attack.
I just gave you a good
example. That minor
difference between you and
I had this outcome.
Now, someone else with a
mass several times as you,
like Rico, the outcome
becomes highly apparent.
This applies to Gears
as well...
Even if you were to get
parts comparable to
Rico's, there is still
that difference in mass.
To make up for this, one
must commit to a single
final strike that thrusts
at the opponent's fissure."

Fei
"...?"

Wiseman
"I have given you the
hint.
It's up to you to figure
it out through experience."

Fei
"Wait! Why is it that you
have the same fighting
style as I!?
And, how do you know my
name!?
Tell me!"

Wiseman
"Hmph...fine."

Wiseman
"It was 3 years ago...
The one who took you, in
your mutilated state, to
that mountain village was
none other than myself."

Fei
"You're the one who
brought me to Lahan!?"

Wiseman
"...Yes.
At your father's
request."

Fei
"My father's...!?
What's your relation to
my father!?"

Wiseman
"Khan and I were
fellow students."

Fei
"...Khan? Is that my
father's name?"

Wiseman
"Why do you ask for your
father's name? You
haven't lost your...?"

Fei
"Yeah...
So tell me anything you
can. Will you?"

Wiseman
"I see...
In your injured state...
I wouldn't have been
surprised..."

Fei
"Wiseman."

Wiseman
"...Khan Wong.
That is your father's
name. Since our youth,
Khan and I studied the
martial arts together..."

Fei
"Father and you...?"

Wiseman
"...Yes. Eventually, your
father became an officer
of a certain country.
There he met a young
woman.
She was about 20 years old.
Her name was 'Karen'.
She was like a flower in
full bloom."

Fei
"Flower...?"

Citan
"He means that she was
extraordinarily
beautiful."

Fei
"I, see.
Then she's...?"

Wiseman
"Yes, your mother.
Khan married your mother,
and I left on a journey
to strengthen myself."

Fei
"Then my mother?
Where is my mother now?"

Wiseman
"You do not remember that
either? ...I see.
...According to Khan,
when you were but a
child, she passed away."

Fei
"Oh......"

Wiseman
"Time passed. During my
journey, I received a
letter from Khan."

Wiseman
"The letter said that,
his son...was taken away
by a man.
Khan once said you had
special powers.
The man who wanted that
power took you.
That man was Grahf."

Fei
"Grahf!?
He took me away!?"

Wiseman
"You've met him?"

Fei
"Yeah...
three times."

Wiseman
"It's amazing you are
still in one piece."

Fei
"It seemed to Grahf,
that I was still not
powerful enough to
achieve his ultimate
goal... Anyway, let me
hear more about this
story."

Wiseman
"Khan wished to go find
his son, and if possible,
he wanted my help..."

Wiseman
"I agreed to Khan's
request and began
searching for you...
...and that man."

Wiseman
"Then came that one
fateful night 3 years
ago.
There was a violent
storm. The storm felt
as if it was thrown at
us through sheer rage.
That night, Khan
notified me that he
had located his son.
So I headed for that
location, as if I was
drawn to it."

Wiseman
"You and Khan were
wounded badly.
I have no idea what had
happened between you two
and Grahf. By then, Grahf
had already gone.
I don't know why, but
probably he was driven
away by Khan.
Khan decided to pursue
Grahf and left me to
care for his son.
I provided you with the
necessary first aid and
left you in the custody
of those village people.
Then I followed after
Khan."

Wiseman
"You probably lost
your memory when you
were injured then."

Fei
"Why did my father
pursue Grahf?"

Wiseman
"I do not even know.
Just that he said it was
not only for the sake of
his son, but also for the
sake of the world, that
that man had to be
disposed of...He added
that if something were to
happen to him, I would
have to take care of the
rest...I haven't seen or
heard from him since."

Fei
"Grahf said that my
father was dead..."

Wiseman
"Hmmm... If Grahf has
been appearing in your
presence... then that is
a possibility... That is
truly unfortunate..."

Wiseman
"Do you remember anything
about your fighting
techniques?"

Fei
"Huh?
No...nothing..."

Wiseman
"Hmmm, your fighting
skills were probably
taught to you by Khan.
Khan and I both studied
under the same master.
That is why my techniques
are similar to yours."

Wiseman
"Well then, I must
be off."

Fei
"To where?"

Wiseman
"I will go find him.
I need to pinpoint what
his intentions are."

Wiseman
"...And also, for
Khan's sake."

Fei
"Just tell me one thing.
What country was my
father an officer for?"

Wiseman
"Are you going there?"

Fei
"I don't know.
There are other things I
have to take care of..."

Wiseman
"Yes."

Wiseman
"The floating land
which tries to hide
behind a wall, protected,
as if to conceal their
failure. That is Shevat."

Wiseman
"That is your father's
country."

Fei
"Shevat...?
The...floating land?"

Wiseman
"Farewell."

Fei
"Hey!"

Citan
"...What a mysterious
person.
Is this the second time
you have met him?"

Fei
"Huh? ...Yeah.
Since that tournament in
Aveh. He sure is a
mysterious person..."

Fei
"I probably won't
understand straight away
what he meant today...
But I think I get the
general idea. I might be
able to do something in
tomorrow's final round...
The differences in the
performance of the Gear
parts are not going to
influence the outcome...
...Well, not as much as I
thought before."

Citan
"Never underestimate the
situation.
You might lose pretty
badly if you think you
can just win by getting
a grasp of the concept."

Fei
"I know, doc."

Citan
"Well, let us return to
our quarters and rest,
Fei...
Your fate lies in the
outcome of tomorrow's
competition. You need to
preserve your strength."

Fei
"Hey, is this...!?"

Hammer
"This must be the Gear
that was furnished by
the committee!"

Citan
"...My this IS a
surprise."

Fei
"Doc!?"

Citan
"...Hmmm. I do not think
this is coincidental...
...I am simply assuming,
but they probably
intentionally furnished
you with Weltall to
collect some data."

Fei
"Intentionally?"

Citan
"Battling itself serves
as one of Kislev's plans.
From Battling, they can
obtain the various combat
data...
...and talented Battlers
which can be used for the
military."

Fei
"Exactly what kind of
data could they get outta
him and I...?"

Citan
"I would not know."

Citan
"But I can assure you
that this has something
to do with that incident
with Aveh..."

Citan
"Well, regardless of what
the empire is up to,
this is good for us."

Citan
"You are able to get the
Gear you are most used
to."

Citan
"If you think about it,
this just enhanced our
probability of escaping..."

Welcome to the Tutorial Mode.
Here you can learn more about
the 'Battling' controls.

Choose a topic to learn about
and press the <X> Button.

Battling is a game where you
fight one-on-one with Gears
in a wide-open, circular
field or arena.
A match ends when either you
or your opponent's Gear takes
too much damage and has its
Durability (H.P.) reach zero.

The game is played on
a screen that displays
the two Gears side on.

This is the Gear you control.
You start the battle on the
left-hand side of the screen.

This is your opponent's Gear.

These are Durability Gauges
that show your damage level.
The top gauge is yours, and
the bottom is your opponent's.
When you attack your opponent,
his Gear's Durability will be
depleted. The Durability in
the gauge cannot be recovered.
The one who deplete's his
opponent's Durability Gauge
(H.P.) to 0 first will become
the match winner.

This is your Heat Gauge.
It indicates the temperature
of your Gear, which is raised
when you use your Dash ability
or fire Ether Bullets.
Your Gear's temperature can
be recovered also, and this
too will be reflected by the
gauge's level.

This is your opponent's
Heat Gauge.

One of these marks will
light up each time you
win a match.
When you win a set number
of matches you will be
awarded the bout's overall
victory.

When you use Ether Bullets or
your Dash ability, your Heat
Gauge will increase. You have
to avoid heating up too much!
The gauge will recover when
you're using normal attacks
or just doing nothing at all.

Even during your normal
running movement it will
slowly drop back down.

If you use your Ether Bullets
and Dash abilities too much,
the rate of heat recovery
won't be able to keep up...
If your Heat Gauge reaches its
limit, your Gear will start to
overheat...

At this point, any further use
of such abilities will damage
your Gear and cause your
Durability (H.P.) to decrease.

When the indicator alongside
of your Heat Gauge is blue,
you can use Ether Bullets and
Dash abilities as per normal.
But, if you use these
abilities while the
indicator is yellow...

your Heat Gauge will exceed
its limit and your Durability
Gauge (H.P.) will decrease.

When the indicator is red,
you have no Durability (H.P.)
left and so cannot fire any
more Ether Bullets.

One strategy is to attack your
opponent as much as you can
while you still have
Durability (H.P.) to spare.

To approach your opponent,
press the Directional Button
towards him/her.
To retreat from your opponent,
press the Directional Button
away from him/her.
Pressing Up / Down on the
Directional Button will move
you away from / towards the
screen respectively.
Push the <T> Button to jump.

Hold down the <C> Button while
moving to Dash. You will run
at twice normal speed, but
your Heat Gauge will rise.
You cannot Dash when your Heat
Gauge is at maximum or when
your Durability (H.P.) Gauge
is low.
Also, your Heat Gauge will not
decrease during the time spent
in the air when you jump while
Dashing.

When you are right in front of
your opponent and you push the
Directional Button away from
him/her...
...you can perform a Back-Dash
(momentary back acceleration).
Use this to instantaneously
dodge your opponent's attacks.

Moving while in desert areas
raises the Heat Gauge faster
than normal. Acceleration is
not as responsive either.

You cannot Dash in the water
areas. Water will also absorb
Ether Bullets, so you cannot
fire while under water.
However, the rate of recovery
of your Heat Gauge is a little
better while your Gear is in
the water.

You can use the <S> and <X>
Buttons to attack.
For example, if you just push
the <S> Button once you will
enter an attack sequence.

If you don't push another
button in the meantime, you
will simply execute the <S>
Button's attack and finish.
Now watch what happens if we
push another attack Button
before the first attack's
movement is completed...
Either the <S> or <X> Buttons
is okay, but here we will try
pushing the <X> Button after
our initial <S> Button attack.
... The <X> Button's attack
will follow immediately after
the <S> Button's attack.

In this way, you can enter up
to three attacks in advance,
and execute them in one swift
sequence.
The type of attack changes
with the number of times
and order that the <S> and
<X> Buttons are pressed.
Try combining the attack
buttons in any order that
you like. For example, <S><X><S>,
<S><S><S>,<X><X><S> and so forth.
In all, there are 14 different
kinds of attack combinations
for you to try out.

You may input up to 3 attacks
before the first attack is
completed.
Among your opponents, there
are Gears that can only attack
up to 2 times in sequence.

For long range attacks, you
can press the R1 Button to
launch an 'Ether Bullet'.

Ether Bullets have the ability
to track the enemy, but will
dissipate upon contact with
such things as walls or water.
For each shot launched, the
Heat Gauge will rise markedly.
If you're not careful, you
may lose all your Durability
(H.P.) by just continually
firing Ether Bullets.
So always keep an eye on
your Heat Gauge, for fear
of losing Durability.

If your opponent fires an
Ether Bullet at you, Dash or
jump to avoid being hit by it.
Also, if you hit your enemy's
back while he/she is fleeing,
you may be able knock him/her
off his feet.

There are times when you can't
dodge your opponent's attack
by simply moving out of the
way.
In those occasions, it is best
to use the L1 Button to guard
against enemy attacks.

If you're about to be hit by
your enemy and you don't think
you can dodge it...
then press the L1 Button to
take a guarding stance.
If you were able to guard
yourself in time, the damage
from your opponent's attack
will be halved.
However, you cannot guard
yourself against attacks
that come from behind you.
It may be difficult to use at
first, but when you get used
to it, guarding will probably
become a useful tactic.

the arena. We're also
fugitives from the
empire...That's why I
must escape. If you stick
around, they'll probably
make you battle that
monster again. This time
you're gonna die..."

Fei
"Is that what you want to
do?"

Rico
"..."

Fei
"Even you should have
things that were left
undone! But in your
present situation..."

Rico
"Silence! Shut up!
Twice! Twice you have..."

Rico
"...If you want to escape
from the empire, you two
should go. I have no
intentions of leaving.
Even if it is going to
end here for me!!"

Citan
"...Hmn!?
Wait a minute.
Something...is not
right."

Fei
"Is that...a rumbling?
What is this vibration?"

Rico
"This vibration...
isn't from the ground."

Citan
"Atmospheric vibrations...
There is something coming
over the skies of the
empire!"

Fei
"Doc, these noises...
They don't sound good."

Fei
"Wh...what's going on?"

Citan
"That earlier shaking and
that echo...
I am positive that the
empire is being attacked
by someone."

Rico
"Ridiculous!!
How did they negotiate
the Imperial air defense
net?"

Citan
"I do not know.
The only thing that comes
to mind is that they
probably used some
special technology to
avoid being seen."

Fei
"...Whatever it is, we
can't just let it be.
Doc, I'm gonna go."

Citan
"I understand.
Under the present
situation I think I can
get out by myself.
Please go, Fei."

Rico
"...Why?
Why are you here?"

Fei
"To get this back.
It's not that I came here
to save you...
The elevator I happened
to use to escape put me in
the arena. I saw you were
getting attacked. That's
why I saved you...
nothing more than that."

Rico
"For a coincidence,
that's a convenient
story..."

Fei
"It's up to you what you
think of it...
So, what're you gonna
do now?"

Rico
"...Do what?"

Fei
"I barged into the arena.
We're also fugitives...
that's why we must
escape. If you stay,
they'll probably make you
fight that monster again.
This time you're gonna
die..."

Fei
"Is that what you want?"

Rico
"..."

Fei
"Even you must
have things
left to do here!
But in your
state of mind..."

Rico
"Silence! Shut up!
Twice. That's twice
you've..."

Rico
"...If you want to escape
from the Empire, do it
now. I have no intentions
of leaving. Even if this
is going to be the end
for me!!"

Fei
"...Hmn?
What's that...?"

Fei
"A...rumbling?
What's this vibration?"

Rico
"This vibration...
That's...no? It's not
coming from the ground."

Rico
"Is it the...vibration
in the atmosphere?"

Fei
"...Whoa. That doesn't
sound good."

Hey! Keep your hands

Hey, do you know
anything about the battle
...in Lahan?
No one's telling me
anything...

...He'll come back,
I know he will...

By the time you return,
I'll reset it."

    Switch on
    Forget it

Damn, why isn't it
moving? How am I supposed
to get the cargo out?

If we move the crane
up here, maybe we could
use it as a step so we
can get in further.

The crane is out of
order. Once it starts
moving, it won't stop
until it hits something.
It'll move by that
panel to the left, but
you'll only be able to
move it left or right.

You can't take that
without permission!

He's back, I know it.
But his soul's not...
or his...hands...legs...
It's horrible...

Is that old man in charge
of the railway in D Block
still there? I owe him a
big favor.

The hell you tryin' to do?
Kill somebody!?

Please don't tell me to
go down to the Gear dock!
How that supply train
shakes! Just thinking about
it makes me...

Please, leave.

What! Is that true?

...Yeah
This door won't open for
anyone except the Kaiser
and his wife.

Ridiculous!
It shouldn't open unless it
scans the right DNA. It
couldn't open that easily!

Yessir!

No one knows what happened
to his wife. Even now, the
Kaiser doesn't know.

"That man was suspected of
trying to assassinate me.
The police are looking into
the matter now.
Well, I have some sudden
matters to attend to, so
if you'll excuse me.
Please tour the district at
your leisure. Oh, and about
my proposition...
I'll be awaiting a positive
response."

Nice work.

Good.

What was all the
fighting between us and
Aveh?
Solaris must have been
manipulating it all...

There's some suspicious
activity in Aveh. They
could attack anytime.

...I wish I could've
seen Goliath in action...

This is the new battle
ship, Goliath!
With its completion,
Aveh and Solaris will
have to submit to us.

Apparently, the Kaiser
had deeper plans. I was
just too shallow.

What is the Kaiser
thinking? Now's the only
chance to strike at Aveh.

Your Gear is awesome!
What's it called?

I saw your incredible
Gear in sub dock!
What's it called?

I'm going to keep on
fighting even if I'm the
only one left...
But...how would that work?

I'm prepared to fight
even if I'm the last one.

Who would've thought
a pirate fighting against
Aveh was really the Prince
of Fatima...?

Aveh and some pirates 
clashed at the border.
Something serious happened
there.

I'm doing some Gear
maintenance today at the
dock... But, they're
only battle Gears.
A lot of people go in an'
out without authorization.
It's good money.

Ultimately, the only
way to end this war is to
strike out at Solaris.

Currently, Aveh is a
puppet government.
Ramsus, a Gebler officer,
is the one who holds the
true power.

But, look at him now.

He is gone now...
and...left this.

...This guy, no matter
how much I tell him, he
won't understand...Hey! He,
he's...Damn...sob...

He's gone...

waiting for him to come

Why do you think we have a
bridge here? Hah hah hah?

Many were injured in the
last Kislev-Aveh war.
Even my family...
War only leaves misery.

The power of the 'Ethos'
still exists as strong
as ever in Kislev...
But many ordinary citizens
died trying to oppose the
influence of the 'Ethos'.

A peace treaty has
been signed with Aveh.
Let's hope it lasts...

Kislev and Aveh almost had
a truce once before.
But the relationship 
worsened due to Gebler.

Ever hear of a red Gear?
I hear it took out a Gebler
unit.
If only he'd be our savior.

Lately, the Kaiser's been
shutting himself out from
the world.
Imagine how happy he'd be
if his family returned...

The 'Ethos' has been using
a human rights movement to
usurp political power.
In a recent parade, there
was an attempt on the life
of the Kaiser.
Fortunately, they failed,
but we don't know when they
might strike again...

I never went on even one
mission.
I don't know whether to be
happy or sad.

Never knowing when you may
get a mission can drive you
nuts.
If I knew it was gonna be
like this, I woulda stayed
at the docks fixing Gears.

I may not have deserved to,
but I made it back alive.

I'm going on a mission soon.
I may not make it back, but
I'm still ready for it.

Now I'm even more confused
with the way things are.
Peace with Aveh probably
won't last.

The lower ranks don't know
how the war's going...
Some of them are panicky
making them very hard to
lead...
What would we do if they
attacked now?

Hey! The train oughtta
be coming 'round now.

Why?

Oh yeah... You were
in D Block, right?

Even nameless soldiers
have lives to live.
Remember that...

Even nameless soldiers

Oh, Gear maintainence...?
I quit that job.

I don't wanna go to D Block.
I got bad memories there.
Anyhow, they'd send me back
if they found out I made it
this high up.

Solaris would only replace
him with another puppet.
What if we exhausted our

Anyway, we must still be

Associate
"We investigated the cause
of the recent explosion at
the southern Aveh border.
Our data showed a large
amount of radiation was
released at the epicenter.
It was probably caused by
an overload of a battleship
class slave generator.
The cause of this is still
unknown.
The shockwaves from that
explosion took out two
thirds of the Aveh and 
Gebler forces combined.
Now, Aveh is in the process
of regrouping their reserve
units, but that should take
at least several days."

the scouts have arrived at
the area you requested..."

"Yes, sir."

Associate
"We know the Gear found was
stolen from the 11th base
by the Gebler unit in Aveh.
And in the investigation of
the machine, we also caught
the unconscious pilot.
The seized Gear has been
transported to the capital.
From the circumstances, we
believe information was
leaked to Aveh."

Associate
"All the Gears except this
were destroyed at Lahan.
Judging from the ID signal,
this one wasn't with Aveh

Fei
"Where is this place?"

Fei
"Do you really doubt me?"

Fei
"?
..."

Fei
"...? Looks likes it's 
locked from the other side."

Fei
"Here...?"

Fei
"...?"

Fei
"Here too...?"

Fei
"...!?"

Fei
"Looks like something's 
written on the wall in 
blood...
 (Red monster).

Fei
"!?
What's this
slimy stuff?"

Fei
"Something the
monster left?"

Fei
"Here...?"

Fei
"What's this
slimy stuff?"

Fei
"Something the
monster left?"

Fei
"It's sure not human!
This is covered in
slime."

Fei
"...? Huh? ...What?"

Fei
"Shoot...the key's not 
here, we can't open 
the door..."

Fei
"Hey...your left arm! 
In that fight, you got..."

Fei 
"?
..."

Fei
"This is covered
in slime."

Fei 
"Here...?"

Fei
"Here...?"

Citan
"Shh, quiet!"

Citan
"...!?
Well...let us look around."

Citan
"...Something is written  
on the wall...
Re...
Red...monster..."

Citan
"This must be his 
dying message."

Citan
"A red monster..."

Citan
"Very interesting."

Citan
"Look, here!"

Citan
"Still...
we cannot be sure...
but it is very likely."

Citan
"How did it go?
...Huh!"

Citan
"I wonder if he will 
forfeit the Battling 
because of that injury?"

Citan
"No,
that is it."

Rico
"Let's look for it. 
We'll talk more if 
we really find it."

Rico
"What's wrong...?"

Rico
"Well, this is the 
murder spot."

Rico
"Must've written it
as he was dying."

Rico
"Hey! What's this slime? 
What a mess..."

Rico
"Looks like he
got it here."

Rico
"Hey, this is the same as 
that stuff over there..."

Rico
"Something's down here, 
that's for sure..."

Rico
"Looks like he
got it here."

Rico
"It's over by that 
drain too."

Rico
"Hey, this is the same as 
that stuff over there..."

Rico
"Well, this is the 
murder spot."

Rico
"No way's it human..."

Rico
"More of the same..."

Rico
"Search around this 
level some more...
The murder site should
be around here...
There has to be some
clues to be found."

Rico
"...Whaddya doin'?"

Rico
"Outa the way!
Let me try...
...gwahh, huh?
...What?...
huff, huff, huff,
ha-h."

Rico
"Idiot.
It pulls open, jeez...
What're you pushing it
for?"

Rico
"I'll see you later...
I'll wait at your dorm."

Rico
"Ugh..."

Rico
"It's nothing..."

"...?
Looks like it's locked
from the other side."

Leonardo
"Heh heh...
Jerk...he's probably 
in bed somewhere now."

Leonardo
"Hmph, I don' get it.
Let's just get this over 
with. Tonight's creepy, 
the rats are restless."

Leonardo
"Oh man, this is bad...
The hairs on the back of
my neck are all standin'
up.
Something weird's out
there."

Leonardo
"Tch!
So you came out!?"

Leonardo
"What the!?"

Leonardo
"Crap...
this...monster's..."

Leonardo
"St...
stay away..."

Leonardo
"Uwaahhhhh"

Heinrich
"Wasn't that a bit too
much? If Champ finds
out, we're done for!"

Heinrich
"What, this isn't 
like you...
Alright, then you
take that one..."

Heinrich
"Umph..."

Heinrich
"...Huh?" 

Heinrich
"Hmm...must just
be my imagination."

Heinrich
"What!!"

Battler
"Hey! It's dangerous down
there. Don't blame me if
you get hurt."

Battler
"Stop wandering around
and just go home."

Fei
"It's locked."

Fei
"Here too."

Fei
"Yeah."

Fei
"Looks like all the 
drains come together 
near the waterfall..."

Fei
"!?
..."

Fei
"Looks like it won't
return to the murder
scene..."

Fei
"Here...?"

Fei
"Is it here?"

Fei
"Umph ...

Fei
"It won't open..."

Fei
"Hey..."

Fei
"That bell must be..."

Fei
"Where's the key?"

Fei
"Are we sure the key
fell somewhere?"

Fei
"It must have fallen
somewhere."

Fei
"Hmmm, this is..."

Fei
"...Damn! No...
It must be this one..."

Fei
"...What?"

Fei
"Why are there
so many keys?"

Fei
"...!
Whew. Open!"

Fei
    Of course
    Wait a sec

Fei
"Okay, let's go."

Fei
"One-two!"

Fei
"Wow! Wait..."

Fei
"...?"

Fei
"...!
Here!!"

Fei
"Alright. Got it!"

Fei
"Umph!"

Fei
"...!!"

Fei
"Behind you!!"

Fei
"Why, did it...
have a bell...?"

Fei
"!?
..."

Fei
"This's covered in slime."

Fei
"Try and use this..."

Fei
"Slime in the drain...
There should be several 
places like this."

Fei
"That's it!
We'll use the bell
there to lure it out."

Citan
"Where does this
drain connect to?"

Citan
"!?
..."

Citan
"There is something 
lurking around here, 
I am sure of it."

Citan
"This is certainly 
the strangest."

Citan
"Do you know where these 
drains come together?"

Citan
"There is always slime
near the murder scene.
Looks like it only 
happened once."

Citan
"They say it will not
return to the same place...
I wonder?"

Citan
"A bell...!?
There is a bell inside."

Citan
"Anyhow we must search
for it now."

Citan
"That certainly is 
odd..."

Citan
"I am sure. This is the 
only drain with slime and
no murder site nearby."

Citan
"It is here!

Citan
"...It had a normal, human-
like intellect."

Citan
"No.
It is better to say...
'had left remaining'."

Citan
"...It is really,
rather sad..."

Citan
"No, there is a murder 
scene near but this is
not it."

Citan
"Yes.
This must be the one 
drain it comes and 
goes from."

Citan
"This is strange..."

Rico
"What the hell
was that...?"

Rico
"There's slime in
this drain too."

Rico
"Everything should 
connect to the sewage 
treatment plant..."

Rico
"It should connect to the
sewage treatment plant."

Rico
"Right! There must be a
place where they meet."

Rico
"Hey, this is..."

Rico
"Hmm. From here it's beside
the waterfall furthest to
the east of here."

Rico
"Hey, watch it!"

Rico
"I'll do it!"

Rico
"Argh arrgh...
Damn! It won't open.
Damn it!"

Rico
"...God dammit!
...no good...it won't 
open with out the key."

Rico
"Vargas should have
had it.
He must have dropped
it somewhere when he
got killed...
Maybe even the rats
got it..."

Rico
"Whaddya talkin' about?"

Rico
"If it was dropped we 
should've been able to
find it."

Rico
"Are you ready?"

Rico
"Stupid!
Whaddya waiting for?
Let's go!!

Rico
"...hurry up..."

Rico
"There's slime here too...
And no murder spot 
nearby...?"

Rico
"Outta my way!!"

Rico
"What!!"

Rico
"This room should connect 
to the sewage treatment 
plant."

Rico
"What!? Whaddya mean?
No..."

Gramps
"Who're you?"

Fei
"Well, what are you 
doing here?"

Gramps
"Hpmh.
I've lived here
for a long time."

Fei
"Hmm, weren't you ever
attacked by the monster?"

Gramps
"I've lived here for a
long time and I haven't
seen that monster lately."

Gramps
"Say, did you come to
get rid of the monster?
That'll make life a lot
nicer around here."

Gramps
"Thanks."

Rico
"Hey gramps!
What are you doing here?
I thought the entrance
was blocked off."

Gramps
"Hpmh.
I've lived here
a long time."

Rico
"All by yourself? In a
spooky place like this?"

Gramps
"As you can see I'm a
mutant. So the monster
never bothers me."

Gramps
"But lately, my new
neighbor's been going
around bustin' things up."

Rico
"What, really?
We're looking for him."

Gramps
"Oh!
Would you get rid of
him for me?
If you need to know 
anything ask me.
I'll help you."

Gramps
"It's dangerous inside. 
You better not go in."

Gramps
"The place where all 
the drains meet?"

Go northeast, and it'll
be behind the door near
the waterfall.

Gramps
"That's the passkey
for the sewers.
You can get into
the room beside the
waterfall with it."

Gramps
"Take care of 
yourselves."

Gramps
"That door is locked?
If it was lost, I'd of
found it. And I don't...
Oh! Yeah. They sweep up
any trash laying around."

Fei
"They?"

Gramps
"Those things movin'
around over there."

Gramps
"But, that's strange.
If it was sucked up the 
things wouldn't move..."

Gramps
"I see you've found the 
keys.
Now you can get in the
room by the waterfall."

Gramps
"Take care."

Gramps
"You saw a broken one?
Nope, you better check
that one again."

Gramps
"That reminds me...
Go through the door to
the northwest, and you'll
find a broken one in
there."

Gramps
"And you can lure it 
with this bell."

Fei
"Ring it here?"

Gramps
"Uh-huh, that's it..."

Gramps
"There is always slime
near the drains it uses.
And he never returns to
the same site twice."

Fei
"So we need a drain
with slime nearby and
no murder site."

Gramps
"Right. 
I think...there's one 
on this floor, north of
here."

Gramps
"What? Empty?
No there's gotta be a way
to lure him out."

Gramps
"Wasn't there anything
in the room?

Gramps
"Oh, you!
Thanks for making this 
place nice to live in 
again.
Take your time and
thanks again!"

Fei
"A bell...?"

Fei
"Do you know something?"

Fei
"Here too..."

Fei
"I seem to smell some 
burnt odor...
I've smelled something 
like it before."

Fei
"What's this?"

Fei
"..."

Fei
"...!?"

Fei
"It doesn't
look broken..."

Fei
"Ha!
There's something
inside.
...!?
Got it!"

Fei
"Ha!
There's something inside.
!?
What's this?"

Fei
"Can we open that
door with these?"

Fei
"I wonder what these
keys are for?"

Fei
"Let's go and see."

Fei
"This is covered
in slime."

Fei
"Here...?"

Citan
"...!?"

Citan
"A tinkle sound...
I heard some kind
of a tinkle sound!"

Citan
"Burnt...?
Hmm, I see..."

Citan
"It appears this slime
was left behind by the
monster."

Citan
"What is this?"

Citan
"...We took the keys out, 
why is it not moving?"

Citan
"Sewage treatment plant?"

Citan
"That is strange...
Where is it?"

Citan
"Yes. 
It must be the same."

Rico
"What's wrong, Citan...
is there something here?"

Rico
"A bell!  
A bell...?"

Rico
"Now that you mention
it...
There is a rumor of a 
strange ringing sound 
down here..."

Rico
"Ugh! ...There's that
smell again.
It's like something's 
burning..."

Rico
"Hey, look at this."

Rico
"This is a rat-
sweeper machine."

Rico
"We call them the
'Catless Rat Removers'!"

Rico
"No...
It's not broken...
Why isn't it moving?"

Rico
"Lemme see it."

Rico
"!!...These were Vargas'
pass keys to the sewer.
They must've gotten 
caught up in this thing. 
That's why it wasn't 
moving?"

Rico
"These are the keys to the
sewage treatment plant."

Rico
"That's where all the 
sewage ends up."

Rico
"From here it's northeast
through the door and near
the furthest waterfall."

Rico
"Yeah, it should be there."

Rico
"Move, dammit!"

Rico
"The slime is over
by that drain too."

                           
        "NO ENTRY!"        
                           

 
Received Keys.

Fei
"What!?"

Fei
"Look up!"

Fei
"It's not here..."

Fei
"!?
..."

Fei
"What's this?"

Fei
"Why would it have this?"

Fei
"...??"

Citan
"It appears it can move 
outside through these
sewage drains."

Citan
"Hmmm...it does not look 
like it will show up now."

Citan
"Let us think about 
what we know so far."

Rico
"It's not here..."

Rico
"It moved..."

Rico
"Damn! 
We should of found 
it here!"

Rico
"Wait! 
We can lure it with 
this thing!"

Rico
"Where can we use it?"

Rico
"Maybe this one..."

Fei
"Not that one...
Um, this one...!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1092
----------------------------------------------------------------------

...Where...am...I...?

Fei
"Hah, hah, hah..."

You shouldn't be here.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1094
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"What is that?"

Citan
"Fei, it is an aerial
attack by Aveh, or
should I say, Gebler!
They really are intent
on attacking the
Imperial capital..."

Fei
"What!?
What about the 
civilians?"

Citan
"They plan on directly 
attacking the Imperial
capital, Nortune...
...oh my god!"

Citan
"That ship is heading...
to the power plant! Oh no!
That is a nuclear reactor!
Most likely that ship is
their main line of attack!
If they drop something on
the reactor...
the whole Imperial capital
will...!"

Fei
"...Be blown away!"

Fei
"If we can change their 
course, will that help?"

Citan
"Yes, however..."

Fei
"Doc, I'm gonna try.
We can't just...
turn and run away."

Citan
"...Alright.
Be careful now."

Citan
"If those civilians 
do not hurry and 
get out..."

Rico
"..."

"Elly!?
You..."

Rico
"NOOOOOO!!"

Fei
"You're in the way!!"

Fei
"MOVE!!"

Fei
"We must change the rear
ship's course or...
...!!
...What,
...you again!?"

Fei
"This is...
meaningless!"

Fei
"Arrgh...
I've had it!"

Fei
"Only two...
enemies, huh?"

Rico
"Hmph, what a joke...
Wasting time on a couple
of guys like these."

Fei
"Rico?"

Rico
"I don't need a reason
to beat the crap out of
anyone who pisses me off.
And of course that means
you too."

Fei
"That's also,
one reason."

Rico
"Shut up, 
let's go."

Fei
"OK, now to change the
last ship's course...
.."

Fei
"Elly!"

Fei
"......Rico,
sorry, but you
go on ahead."

Rico
"What!?
You've come this far 
and now you're scared?"

Fei
"I'll catch up, I promise.
...Please."

Rico
"...Well, even without
you, I can make do by
myself."

Rico
"Then...I guess I'll go
on ahead."

Fei Talks to Elly on Kislev Battlefield - file17
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"You're kidding?
What are you doing
here, Elly?
I thought you agreed
to get out of the
military!"

Fei
"Then, you're saying
this is also one of
your duties!?"

Fei
"Are you serious?
You do know what you're
doing, don't you!?
How can you say that
knowing where that ship
is headed and what the
outcome may be...?"

Fei
"C'mon, Elly!
Say something!"

Fei
"Then..."

Fei
"Freedom? 
Me?"

Fei
"Then why don't you
do that too, Elly!?"

Fei
"Elly..."

Fei
"I don't have a place
I belong in either..."

Fei
"... Bart and crew,
even their whole ship,
are all missing...
They disappeared after
the battle with Gebler.
So, I don't have a place
to belong to anymore..."

Fei
"...Do you enjoy this?"

Fei
"Barging into someone
else's country, and
destroying the place...
Dragging innocent
people into
becoming victims...
Do you enjoy fighting
that much!? Is it that
much fun for you to
watch people die!?"

Fei
"If that's the case...
then come with me!"

Fei
"Just forget
everything and
come with me!!"

Elly
"That's asking for too
much! I'm an officer
of the Gebler forces!"

Elly
"Yes!
My duty is to
escort the Hecht.
And to eliminate
all enemies that
get in its way...
So you better get
out of the way...
Cause if you don't
move then I'll
have no choice but
to eliminate you!"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"I know!
I do understand
what I'm doing!"

Elly
"Change.
How I wanted
to change...
I've thought of
changing, but
I couldn't...
I don't have
the freedom
like you do!

Elly
"Yes! Am I wrong?
To be able to choose
where you belong...
To be able to fight
alongside those who
believe in their
own cause...
Even if you have
much more anguish
to deal with...
At least you have the
freedom to choose
your own path!
Unlike me...!"

Elly
"If I could, I would
already be doing it!
But I can't...
This is my place. And
that's how it is here!"

Elly
"... So... please,
understand..."

Elly
"Huh?"

Elly
"Really...
Then, why are you
fighting now?
Who are you
fighting for...?"

Elly
" ? "

Elly
"Don't be ridiculous!
I would never find
pleasure in that!"

Elly
"Wha!?
What are
you doing!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"There's no time! 
Rico, hurry and change
the course."

Fei
"Whooooaaaaaa!"

Fei
"Damn!!
There's too much mass!"

Elly
"Hold on!
We can avoid a direct
hit on the reactor with
three Gears."

Fei
"Ah, ahhh."

Rico
"OK, we've steered it away
from the power station.
Let's bail out! Fei!"

Fei
"But, now it's heading
right for the residential
district!"

Elly
"He's right! 
We need to bring it down
somewhere where it won't
cause so much damage."

Rico
"Impossible!
We can't change its course
anymore than we have!"

Fei
"No! We've got to
hold it up as long
as we can!"

Rico
"What are you, deaf?"

Rico
"Huh!?
We're overheating!"

Fei
"Damn! 
Not now!"

Rico
"There's nothin' more we
can do! Hanging on anymore
will just be suicide!"

Fei
"But..."

Rico
"That's it, I'm bailing
out! C'mon!"

Fei
"Elly!"

Fei
"Stop! 
What're you doing? 
If you do that..."

Elly
"Don't worry. 
My Gear is from Solaris. 
It's still...all right."

Fei
"Elly! What are you
doing? If you keep
going you'll...!"

Elly
"But......what else 
can we do?
At least it will reduce
the damage.
......Sorry.
It's better than doing 
nothing."

Fei
"Ellllllllly!!"

Elly
"...
Just hold on a bit more!
Please!"

Elly
"...!
Is this...it...?"

Broyer
"Wha? Who's that? 
Aren't those the Aveh 
pirates?"

Elly
"!? That's.........
Fei!
What the...!?"

Stratski
"Hey, this is Kislev!
What's he doing here?"

Helmholz
"He seems to follow
us everywhere!"

Vance
"What's with this guy? 
A little too persistent,
perhaps?"

Elly
"..."

Broyer
"Third times a charm!
Let's get 'em!"

Elly
"Ah! 
Wait!"

Elly
"Renk!?"

Renk
"From our last incident, I
can tell that your friends
with that Gear's pilot.
But, there's no way we can
stop. It doesn't matter
that we're escorting the
Hecht.
I wanna fight him, not as
enemy soldiers, but as
rival competitors...
We're the Gebler special
forces and we won't be
beaten!"

Elly
"..."

Renk
"Sorry, I'm gonna have
to kick his butt. 
Any objections?"

Elly
"I..."

Citan
"Everyone, over here!
Hurry!"

Hammer
"Master, there're people
over there that can't get
out! We're doomed!"

Citan
"Don't give up, Hammer!
Fei is fighting too!
Fei...no longer wants to
watch innocent people lose
their homes, their town,
those that are important
to them..."

Rico
"My...
...town?"

Rico
"Hmph, don't make me laugh.
Who gives a damn about this
crap town..."

Even you must have
things left to do here!

Rico
"......I'm,
crap too."

Fei
"Let's go!"

Elly
"Ouch! 
What?"

Fei
"Just come!"

Fei
"Look at this town!
Take a good long look! 
This is what you've done?
Does the word, 'duty'
justify all of this?
Does it!?

Fei
"Elly!"

Elly
"But that's all that
was left!"

Fei
"You're still saying
that?"

Fei
"......
It's just not like you.
If you don't want to then 
don't do it.
You shouldn't have to 
force it just to have a
place to belong..."

Elly
"..."

Fei
"What was I fighting
you for just now?
......You wanted to know?
I don't really know. I
know I was helping Bart
and the others.
But I still don't know
what I should do.
Maybe I'm just looking
for a place to fit in.
But I think it's better
to fight than do nothing.
If fighting helps you or
your friends even a bit,
then it's worthwhile. 
That's......
not nothing.
......it's something."

Elly
"Fei!"

Fei
"I'm going."

Elly
"No! You can't! 
Dominia is not like
the other soldiers!
She is an elite within
the Gebler elite.
She's one of the Elements,
Ramsus' personal guard!
You won't stand a chance!"

Fei
"Still, I have to 
stop this."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"Citan and Hammer
have nothing to do
with Kislev...
but they're trying
desperately to get the
civilians to safety.
Even Rico, who must hate
this town, still stays
with me. That's why I
have to go."

Elly
"Fei..."

Dominia Kislev Fight - file23
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Sorry about that...
Oh, but I see you've
made a girlfriend...
If we can defeat her,
we should be able to
change the course of
this ship. Let's go!"

Fei
"Of course not!
We're not gonna take
'this ship' down.
We're gonna take
'you' down!"

Rico
"What the heck were
you doing, Fei!?
Were you expectin' me
to do all the dirty work
of clearing away these
punks for you, alone?"

Dominia
"Hmph.
Just one more extra
runt isn't going to
allow you to down
the 'Ship-Bomb Hecht'!"

Dominia
"Hah! What insolence!
But what do you expect
coming from Lambs...!"

Dominia
"Eeeaaaahh!  ...Guh...
Why you...
Remember this...
One day I'll pay
you back for this...
I promise!!"

You're...

Elly

Fei

Stupid...foolish..."

Elly
"...Are you...crying?
...sorry."

Fei
"...It's okay."

Elly
"Can you...
...forgive me?"

Fei
"...It's not your fault,
Elly.
It's not your fault..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"Elly, let's 
go back."

Elly

again.

Citan
"There seem to be people.
It may be best not to go
in through here..."

Citan
"Someone is approaching.
We should hide."

Everyday work, work, work.
Doesn't anything fun ever
happen around here?

No doubt...
That last champion looks
like he's been matched with
the beast.

Now that's something.
Let's get this work done
and go check it out.

Yeah. We need to do
that, we've been workin'
too much lately.

It is locked.

It is already unlocked.

Used the Master Key.

You have no key.

 Received Minigear.

Security has so much free

"!"

Citan
"Hey...Fei, wait a
minute."

Fei
"What's wrong, doc?"

Citan
"This is a part that
allows a Gear to recover
30% of its HP. 
If you have this equipped,
you can activate this
during battle. It is a
highly useful item but
the drawback is that you
will use fuel, so you must
use it with caution."

Fei
"That really doesn't
matter unless we get
back the Gear, doc.
There's no one here so
let's hurry up and get
out of here."

Citan
"Uh, oh yes. My usual
habit...
Well, we should take
it anyway since we
have the chance."

Hey, make sure you
return the Master Key back
to the shelf.

Oh, it's already
starting. There's no way
we can miss this.

Yes, sir.

This should do it...

Heeeey, did ya'll hear?
The battle between the
ex-Champ and the beast
is about to begin.

 
 Received Master Key.

 
 Received Frame HP30.

I'll try to help too.
What do you want?"
    Party change
    Shop
    Nothing

Hammer
"Well, good luck. I'll
catch up with you later."

Hammer
"Muahahah! Hey bro, I
went ahead and opened up
the locks for you.
What? The Gear? Nah, don't
worry about the details.
I'm the information man!
There's nothing outta my
reach.
But hey, there aren't
any enemies though.
Something's suspicious.
Oh yeah, you can
change your party and
even shop.
Need anything?"
    Party change
    Shop
    Nothing

Fei
    I'll help!
    Uh, better not...

Fei
"Doc, do you know
how to operate it!?"

Errr...

Citan
"Are you going to think
ahead? Or are you going
to help?"

Citan
"Well then, shall we go?"
    Yeah, let's go
    Hang on a sec.

Citan
"Well everyone, this
could be dangerous,
so please be seated."

Citan
"Call out if you are all
ready."

Citan
"...Uh, let us just say
I accepted it."

Citan
"Just stay calm for a
little longer."

Citan
"I think we can do
this."

Citan
"...
Shall we see if it works?"

Citan
"Not really...
But, Fei...
You were not thinking of
stealing this big thing
without knowing how to
operate it, were you?"

Citan
"Well, anyway..."

Citan
"Is everyone ready?"

Citan
"It will...
shake a little."

Rico
"..."

Rico
"Hmph. So when are you
going to let me down?"

Rico
"Get a load of this!
I can't believe they'd
make such a thing..."

Rico
"Couldn't you
tell us..."

Elly
"So they were this
close to having it up
and operational..."

Elly
"Fei, let's go."

Hammer
"Bro, this thing is
incredible... Boy
is this exciting."

Hammer
"We're almost there, bro.
I'm a little nervous."

Hammer
"...
a bit sooner..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1146

I'm slippin'

Hammer
"Yiiiiiiiiikkkessssss!!"

Fei
"Yeah..."

Fei
"What happened, doc...
...!!"

Fei
"...It's him."

Fei
"I'm going out with
the Gear..."

Fei
"...Doc. I don't know how
to say this but...I've got
a bad feeling."

Fei
"It's not that.
It's not like...
It's like this feeling
of uneasiness that
I've had before..."

Fei
"And I feel like we're
being watched..."

Citan
"Are you thinking of
that man in black?
Thinking about him will
not get you anywhere.
First of all, it is not
like you..."

Citan
"You too!?
Well, to tell the truth,
I am getting a terrible
feeling of deja vu..."

Citan
"The shaking has
subsided. We should be
in good shape for now."

Citan
"!!
Fei!"

Citan
"If it is them,
they are okay.
Nevermind that,
Hammer, go to
that trigger!"

Citan
"You must fire.
Look, it is coming."

Citan
"Hammer! Calm down and
concentrate. It is
heading straight at us.
All you have to do is
aim well, pull the
trigger and fire."

Citan
"Good, keep it there and
do not move your aim.
Get ready to fire in..."

5...4...3...2...1...
Fire!!

Rico
"..."

Rico
"Shut up!!!"

Elly
"That person...wasn't
aiming for me.
Why...?"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"Th, that's..."

Elly
"Fei,
where are you going!?"

Elly
"Fei!"

Hammer
"Awww, Master Rico...
please don't be mad.
It was just a joke.
Master Rico, it's because
of you I am what I am.
C'mon..."

Hammer
"Geeze! Why am I the one
getting yelled at when it
was me who took'm out..."

Hammer
"Bro, what're we gonna
do now?
Go to Aveh as planned?"

Hammer
"M, Master!?"

Hammer
"Even Elly..."

Grahf intercepting The Goliath - file25
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Grahf!?"

Grahf
"The Goliath wasn't
built for you to use.
You must remain on this
land a little longer.
I can't allow you to
leave..."

Grahf
"So, you can now
draw upon more of
your power...
If that's the case
then..."

Grahf
"Huh!?"

Citan
"Fei!
Hold on tightly now!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hammer
"Aaaaaaah!
Looook ooouut!!
Master Citan!! It's alright
to throw the black creep,
but bro and Master Rico as
well...?"

Hammer
"Trigger...?
You mean this?
What do I do with..."

?

Hammer
"The~y're he~re!!"

Hammer
"Aiming..."

Hammer
"L, like this?"

Hammer
"Y, ye, ye,
aaaaaawwww yeeeaaahhh!!!"

Hammer
"Master, sir, did you
just see my MAD SKILLZ!?
I just might be a genius!
...Wha?"

Hammer
"By the way, what's up
with bro and the gang?
You don't think they
fell off?"

Hammer
"Well, at least you
still got me.
It should be a piece
o'cake with me around.
Right, Master, sir?"

SMACK!!

Elly
"What's wrong?"
Fei."

Fei
"Oh, it's nothing."

Elly
"Okay... I'm glad..."

Elly
"Anyway, Citan is it
okay? We're flying in
such a large ship. 
What if Kislev or Aveh
finds us..."

Citan
"We are fine. I thought
ahead and picked a course
over the sea.
There are not any military
units stationed out here.
Even then, this thing is
not something that will
go down so easily..."

Citan
"This cannot be right!?
Are we being attacked!?"

Fei
"Enemies!?"

Citan
"I do not know. But I did
not think they would be
submerged here..."

Elly
"Are we okay!?"

Citan
"...Unfortunately, there
is no way we can avoid
descending.
Fei, Elly, get out first.
I will follow later."

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"We have no time for a
debate now, Fei!!
Do you think you have the
skills needed to keep the
Goliath in the air as long
as possible!?"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Then hurry up
and get out."

Citan
"Now then..."

Citan
"...And you too, Hammer!
You are going too!"

Hammer
"Y, yy, yessir!!"

Rico
"Argh! Quit dawdling.
We're going."

Hammer
"Yessir!!"

Citan
"Now...where did
they..."

Citan
"!!
That ship..."

Citan
"Sigurd...
I think you need to
rethink your method of
disciplining..."

Bart

That's the power of the
Bart Missile!!
Even Kislev's prototype

Bart
"S-stay back...
Keep away!!"

Ramsus
"Cancel the alert status.
Begin repairs and
resupply immediately."

Miang
"The Prime Minister and
General Vanderkaum are here
to see you, Commander."

Ramsus
"Hmph, what a
dismal welcome."

Miang
"What do you expect?
We're on the 'surface'."

Ramsus
"Miang, let's
disembark."

Miang
"Yes, sir."

We have the coordinates
of those recent
dimensional vibrations.
N24, E92, Ignas, in the
Lahan region, the
northeast ocean.
From the wave pattern,
it's definitely a Gatekeeper.

There are no regular
mainland flights.

Ramsus
"Could it be Shevat's
Aphel Aura?"

No. The mass is
different. It's a much
smaller pattern.

I can't believe that
the Lambs have a ship
equipped with a
Gatekeeper. 

Ramsus
"It probably is Kislev's.
The last purge was not 
complete."

Ramsus
"Damn you..."

Grahf
"Shouldn't you pursue?"

Ramsus
"What?"

Grahf
"The one who caused
you so much pain and 
grief is on that ship.
And it's headed for
Aquvy."

Ramsus
"Put all the crew members
on emergency alert. We're
attacking the Kislev ship."

Miang
"We can't, Commander!
We don't have orders 
from the capital yet.
If we move from here..."

Ramsus
"I don't care!
I won't allow them
to escape!"

We will take the boundary
between gates 1 and 2,
it's the shortest way to
Aquvy.

Ramsus
"Fine."

Message from Kelvena.
Dominia is withdrawing
in Haishao. She will
pursue the aerial
battleship.

Dimensional 
vibrations, level 8!
A huge formation is 
coming this way!

Miang
"Here is the engagement
report between Haishao
and the enemy Gear."

Ramsus
"!!
This is the..."

Miang
"I'm sure of it.
It's currently at Thames.
If not, somewhere in the
ocean nearby."

Ramsus
"Change course!
Head for Thames..."

Miang
"Wait. Their mother ship
Yggdrasil seems to be
able to submerge.
If they submerge,
they'll have the upper
hand on Haishao.
Any attack we might make
would just be wasted
since they could
simply dive.
But if we eliminate that
function first, it's
still not too late.
I've already made the
proper 'arrangements'."

Ramsus
"Arrangements?"

Miang
"Yes, sir."

Ramsus
"All right.
We'll try it your way."

Miang
"Thank you, Commander."

Ramsus
"By the way... What
happened between you and
Dominia? She was livid."

Miang
"I'm sorry. It had to
do with that Yggdrasil
incident earlier.
Those girls work hard.
Especially for you...
It's my job to be hated."

Ramsus
"Out of the way!
Let me through!
That bastard!
I'll hunt him
out myself...!"

Kelvena
"Please calm down,
Commander!"

Tolone
"We'll take care of
him and his friends!"

Ramsus
"What could you fools do?
Imbeciles!
Only I can beat him!
Only I, who transcends
all other humans, can
possibly take him down!"

Ramsus
"Move!!"

Dominia
"Commander!
Wait!!!"

Begin docking 
procedure. 

Hull secure. 

Hull secure. 

Hull, all sections 
secure. 

Docking complete.

Faster than we 
expected...

The awakening of the
untouchable one...

It has been 3 years
since we heard any news.
According to the memory
cube, 'he' is currently
in Nortune, the Imperial
capital of Kislev.

Detestable...
Vexing...
Cursed...

If only 'he' did not
exist, the Lambs would
not have been turned
into the 'Animus'.
It has been 500 years
since our fall in the
'Days of Destruction'
that 'he' caused...
We would not have had
to do this in such a
troublesome manner,
as we do now.

The excavation of the
'Anima Relics' in each
area is proceeding as
planned.
It's too late to change
things now.
But in the future, we'll
shape what will be.

Fade...
Vanish...
Disappear...

Although, we do not
know which route it
flowed from...
...we're fortunate
the 'gate keeper'
was activated.

From the 'Ethos'?
Or...

It doesn't matter.
Although...

So are you saying
that we mustn't
break Ignas'
equilibrium?

Well, it is the
surface...and that
land is unclean!

That is merely
an excuse.

It's a justifiable
reason. Even Cain
would not object.

But we can't use the
'Gaetia Key'.
Not until the proper
time comes.

There's a third fleet
in Bledavik. Their
reserve units will do.

Oh, his fleet.
Your orders?

To purge.
Give no motives. If he
knew our motives, it's 
obvious he'd do something
unpredictable.

But, wouldn't we
need more men to
raze the entire
area of Nortune?

There is an ancient
reactor in Nortune.
We'll use that.
The half-life fallout
will be 1000 years. 
Nothing will be able to
live within 300 kelts
of the explosion.
However, they've lived
through that before.
They won't perish
that easily.

But, we must at
least eliminate
'him'.

Yes.
There's nothing we need
from there. So be it,
take care of it.

If it is a
direct hit
...

Well then...

Your orders are given.

Disobedience...
Ramsus' orders are to
excavate the 'Anima
Relics' in Ignas...
and to watch over the
Lambs. What is he...
...

We can recover the
'Anima Relics'
anytime.
Moreover, we learned
that 'he' was on the
transfered ship.
Ramsus was probably
after 'him'.

...
So it was the trauma.

Nay. In this case,
Knigret...
It was the severe
external wounds.

According to the
memory cube...
we've found multiple
subjects around
'him' that possess
the 'Animus' factor.

Is it -Sufradi-,
the subject of
the M Project?

Yes.

Coincidence?

Nay, it is beyond that.
They were either 
attracted to 'him' or...

Unexpectedly, it's
developing into
the same condition
as 500 years ago.

That does not rule out
the possibility he planned
it this way intentionally.

The transfer point
is Aquvy...
It's near the
Thames.

If it is Aquvy,
Krelian's headed that way.

Krelian?
Himself?
What for?

It seems they've found it.
For over 4000 years he
searched for Zeboim's
legacy.

Legacy...
Is that the technology
he was talking about?

Yes.

Molecular engineering...
...nanotechnology.
The land of all creations,
the capital of Zeboim
culture...resting beneath
the ocean of Aquvy.
For 19 years, the 'Ethos'
kept it secret.

Is this acceptable,
Cain?

Emperor Cain
"Yes, it will do for now."

19 years...
That coincides with
the time when the earth
shifted...

Indeed.

But, I don't understand.
That technology doesn't
seem that crucial to
us...

He is still a Lamb.
Giving him the ability
to do as he wishes is
questionable.

There are times when
even we do not know
what he is thinking.

Emperor Cain
"Let it be.
I will take
responsibility for that.
On another matter...
Weren't you all going
to...
'eliminate' it?"

It's just
by chance.

It is probable the
location is Ignas.

Anyway, I never
believed it would be
eliminated so easily.

The purge was
a failure.
This shall never
happen again.

If the 'Animus' are
together, it is all
the more reason.

Yes.

Cain, why are YOU so
concerned about it?
To us, 'he' is
insignificant...

It could only be
a poison to us.
It could never
be a remedy.

'Anonelbe'...
You don't still believe
that, do you?

That is merely an
illusion. Not
even an ideal.

The result...
is what I am now. It is
as you see it.

Or rather...
Is it the 'emotion'
you have long
forgotten?

Emperor Cain
"..."

Cain,
we are 'gods'.

All that was needed was
to fulfill the duty.
Now, I sense a thought
of greed.

A selfish creed...
I question his...
faith.

We have no need for
an organization of
fanatics.

We will seek
what they
will...it's
their nature.

But, too much is undue,
something must be done.
A reprimand is necessary.

They are an expendable
group. There is nothing 
we can do at this point.

Yes, there is nothing
more to gain from their
continued existence.

They've already done
what we required.
Currently, we're in the
process of 'dealing' with
each area responsible.

Stein is in charge
of dealing with Aquvy.

Bear in mind
the need for a
'fitting solution'.

Didn't we just take care
of that?

Moreover, Krelian is...
rather exhorbitant. It's
only a molecular machine.
Why is he placing so much
importance on it?

'Humans', and 
'machines', it's all the
same to us.

Yes, they are all
the same...

You're back...?
Well, find
anything?

Krelian
"Yes.
I have obtained a colony
of nanomachines."

How unsound.

In any case, is the
M Project proceeding as
planned? We need superior
bodies and servants.

We've spent far too
much time here.
We can't afford to mistake 
the ultimate destination 
of this new civilization.

They exist because
of their 'mother'.

Krelian
"Hmm.
You've betrayed your
'mother', your 'creator',
just to sustain your own
egos. You have no right to
speak so...

That was...foolish,
that was the past.
When we were trapped in
that cursed flesh...
But now, it is different.

Krelian
"I'll take no orders from
you.
You have lost that flesh
long ago, and now reside
in the SOL-9000 as data.
Did you forget who revived
you in there?
What may be an eternity
to man is but a moment to
a god.
I have no need for
hesitation."

...Useless.
They allowed contact
with Shevat...

There is an 'Anima Relic'
in Shevat...
...We can't afford to have
them align before
preparations are complete.

It's meaningless if it
is not compatible with
our type.

You want to bury
all of Shevat?

What of the 'Animus'?

There are others.
We must respond
severely so this
doesn't happen again.

What about the Shevat
gate? As long as it is
there, we can't get in.

Easy. We just use
Achtzehn's gravity
cannon to compensate
for the time-space warp.

Achtzehn?
Is it operational?

Re-education is complete.
It is ready. 
The airborne squad is
already assembled.

Any side effects?

The regulated 71st
Airborne should have no
problems.

Well then, I look
forward to this.

Allowing the contact
with Shevat...

Not only Shevat.
The Ignas defeat,
the Thames retreat.
And yes, even Elru,
you...

Useless...
as always...

A failure to begin
with...

'Trash'...

Ramsus
"What did you just say!?"

Hmph...
It's the truth.

And just what is that
attitude?...
You should show
some loyalty.

Ramsus
"H, how dare you ridicule
me by calling me 'trash'?
Damn you!"

Ramsus
"Guh...guhaah."

Miang
"Calm down, Commander!
It's not good for you.
You still haven't recovered
from the last battle!"

It does not matter.

The Lambs are probably
on their way to destroying
the gate. But, not
this time...

I'd like to see
your 'intrinsic' powers.

If you aren't the
'trash' we think you
are...

Ramsus
"Miang...
Launch the ship...
Get to him..."

Ramsus
"This time...
I'll go myself... and
I'll bring him down..."

Miang
"Commander, you can't go 
out there like that!"

Kelvena
"Commander, request
permission to handle
the situation?"

Miang
"You all?"

Dominia
"We'll do our best to
meet your expectations."

Kelvena
"Commander please,
you must get medical
attention..."

Dominia
"To make our ideals
a reality."

Kelvena
"Well then, we are off."

So, there's one
surface gate left.

Ramsus, he couldn't
defend it...

What is the purpose of
his existence...

Once 'trash', always
'trash'. How much can one
really expect?

However, it must not
be aligned before the
'Animus' data is
retrieved.

You are right.
There is a higher
probability of
not getting
the proper type.

As it was in the
past...

We can't allow the 
lambs to go free yet.

Krelian
"Who cares about the
gate anyways."

Krelian...

This can't be.
The panic has spread
to Etrenank.

Krelian
"Those fools we call
citizens are easily
manipulated by
the Emperor's
words alone."

You think Cain
will be receptive?

His body's already at
the limit, he can't hold
out much more...

Krelian
"As usual a 
clone may be used.
Those fools won't know
the difference.
And even if the 
barrier fails, it
still will not be like 
the disaster before.
Anyhow...
if I recall, there's some
very intriguing data on
that memory cube."

And what is that?

Krelian
"The 'mother'."

The 'mother'?

Krelian
"Indeed.
It is probable that the
'mother' exists
among the Lambs."

Are you telling us
our 'mother'is
somewhere else? 
Why didn't we
notice that
sooner...?

Krelian
"The sign of the
'mother'...
Her persona, only
appears after she
reaches a certain
age...
There is also a high
probability that she
transmigrated into
the 'Antitype'."

The 'Antitype'...
That woman from Nisan...?

Krelian
"Here...
I would like to use that
nanotechnology product,
'Emeralda'."

What you retrieved
from the Thames?
Why?

Krelian
"To be sure.
As 'mother' says,
that nanomachine colony...
that artificial organism,
was a creation between the
'Contact' and the
'Antitype' 4000 years ago."

The 'mother's'
memory...

Krelian
"Yes, that is it.
We can probably attain
some kind of reaction.
But even if we obtain no
reaction, and if
'Emeralda'is destroyed,
I've already gathered all
the data I need.
Any loss of it will have no
consequence to the plan."

Cain...
Making a ridiculous
setup with Hyuga...

He certainly has his
deficiencies compared to
our digitized existence,
which permits us to use
a higher level of
logical thinking...

He is restricted by his
human form.

Regardless...with
just one machine, he
annihilated Etrenank...
His powers must not be
underestimated...

We're already short of
time. The key,
use the key...

Krelian
"Even you are beginning
to feel the pressure?"

Krelian... What
is Cain's situation?

Krelian
"The usual life extension
treatment. He'll hold out
for... a little
longer..."

Does that mean we may
not make it in time...?

Krelian
"I wouldn't know...
You spoke of using the key.
Can you be sure he
can be eliminated?"

That we do not know.
You know who he is...

If he is the 'contact',
there is a possibility
he may not transmigrate.

It's an organism
composed of multiple
generations. It's a
matter of probability.

That does not mean we
can just remain idle.

Yes. At this rate we
are bound to make the same
mistake. But we can't fail
a second time.

Krelian
"Well don't worry. I've
sent Ramsus to deal with
him."

What can a failure
like him do?

He couldn't even defend
Etrenank. What can you
expect from 'trash'
like him.

Krelian
"Even if he has the
'Anima Relic'?"

The 'Relic'...?

Krelian
"The relic we recovered
before has been aligned
with his Gear.
There shouldn't be
any problems now. He
should be able to use
his full power."

You're going to take
the task yourself?
Although he transmigrated,
wasn't he once one of you?
I don't understand you.

Krelian
"I've thrown away all
feelings of human emotion.
All I need is 'her'."

But isn't that
also an emotion?

Krelian
"...Of course."

Is that a
blunder...

Krelian
"You are irritating...
Do you wish to cease your
existence?"

Fine. We shall leave
it at that.

What do you mean...
he's still alive...!?

Krelian
"Yes."

Ridiculous.
Didn't Ramsus shoot
him down?

Krelian
"She was also on the Gear
that Ramsus shot down.
I won't have her die."

But, there is already
a 'mother'...
Although she may be the
'Antitype', as long as the
current mother exists...

Krelian
"As far as I see it,
that is not complete."

Quite picky aren't you...?
Didn't you say you threw
away all human emotions?

Krelian
"I don't care what you
think. Anyway...
As far as he is concerned,
I will put Ramsus onto him.
Any objections?
Where is he presently?"

Etrenank is destroyed,
but part of the memory
cube is still active.
We should still be able
to locate individuals.

Wait a moment...
He has left the crash
site and is heading
towards Ignas.

Krelian
"I see.
So he has left the area...
(That means...
it is only a matter of
time before the seal is
broken...)"

Did you say something?

Krelian
"It's nothing.
Just sit there and wait
for the good news."

What about retrieving
the girl?
The key is already
beginning to resonate.
The time of the
resurrection is near.

Krelian
"We can get the
girl anytime.
It doesn't have
to be now...
Let's take our
time..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramsus tries to fight Fei in Forest - file39
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On my way to Ignas,
   I re-encountered him.

       Kahran Ramsus...
Ramsus once again
   stood in my way,
      in his Omnigear
         'Vendetta'...

It was an unavoidable
battle. I released the
new function that was
added to my Mark II
Gear... 'System Id'!

Ramsus'
   absolute confidence
      was shattered...
Leaving only his
   cry of disbelief
      and resentment,
Ramsus' machine
   disappeared into
      a sea of foliage.
Why he was so
   fixated on me...
      I know not why.
         But he did say
            this...

If only you
   didn't exist...
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, they are naturally
germinating because the
resurrection of god is
near...

Those who will become the
body of our servant...
I never knew so many would
exist, even without using
the key...

But, some of them
still have not yet
begun to germinate...

Are they not
destined to be
the flesh of god?

Or, perhaps those
are the enemies
of god...

Let us reactivate
the strategic points
of the Soylent...

At any rate, they are
just incomplete mutants.
They are useless now in
their half-finished form.

God's apostles.
There cannot be any
harm in having too
many of them...

The germinating of those
destined to be the body
of the servant of god.

As before, the humans
are gathering in Nisan.
At this rate...

Not to fear...
This might actually
be helpful for us.

The time is near.
Should we not prepare for
those who are to become the
fleshly body of god, and
those who will awaken god?

The time has come
to activate the
'Gaetia Key'...

Wha, what!?

Cain!?

Emperor Cain
"What more do you intend
to do? I can not allow
you to use the 'Key'!"

Cain!
What are you doing!?

Without the resurrection
of god, our purpose
cannot be fulfilled!

Or...are you planning
on perishing with god,
Cain...?
Without fulfilling our
purpose...

Emperor Cain
"Your purpose...?
You were fated to
it from your birth.
Why haven't you realized
that it does not arise
from your own free will?"

I've heard enough...

Yes.
This is of our
own volition...

If you still insist
on opposing us...

Guuaaaaaaaaah!

Emperor Cain
"Have you forgotten?
You are my subordinates!
I can destroy you if I
so desire."

Nnnuuuuuuuhh...

Emperor Cain
"We have already done our
part.
It's time to pass the helm
to the next generation.
The people will not
perish..."

He is no longer
one of us...

Yes. He dares to go
against our objectives.
Just like the other one...

We can still activate
the key...

We must do something
about the one who
stands in our way...
We must eliminate
Cain...

But, we can not
stand up to his
power.

Only 'Cain' can
destroy 'Cain'...

So 'Mother', will
you do it for us?

Miang
"Maybe...
Did Krelian say anything?"

Something concerning
the potential ability
as a countervailing
existence...
With everything
focusing towards
a single point...

Miang
"I see...
But Kahr is still shaken
up by...yesterday's
defeat against Fei.
We are almost ready.
I need just a little
bit more time..."

Then we'll wait.
We'll wait till the
time is ripe...

Worthless...

Trash...

Reject...

Why even bother
existing...?

Defect...

Be gone...

We have no use
for you...

Hah!
Trash is of more worth
to us than you...

Ramsus
"..."

Miang
"Kahr...
Don't worry.
I'll always be by your
side. No one knows you
better than I do.
So don't..."

Ramsus
"Miang!
Is this...
Is this all I can do?
Is this the extent of my
strength and abilities?
I couldn't beat him...
And in front of that
woman, I couldn't even
do a thing...
Is this the limit of my
existence!?
My abilities...!?"

Krelian
"...You're the same as
Cain.
An archetype that
surpasses all humans.
I made you in the same way.
But he is the one who is
preventing you from fully
releasing your powers.
Divided powers...
That man was your original
form. The primordial
superior being...
If you could defeat him,
then you would be..."

Miang
"Yes.
Even with your superior
constitution, the
existence of the original
being hinders you.
If you could eliminate the
divided power, then it
would all be yours...
Don't you agree, Kahr...?"

So...
Cain is dead?

Yes.

The final fate for
one bound within
everlasting flesh...

If only he had just
accepted our logical
ideals too...

A fitting end for someone
who had become dominated
by needless flesh.
Excellent work, Krelian.

Krelian
"..."

Now there is nothing
that can stand in the
way of us accomplishing
our objective.

The 'Anima Relics'
have been awakened and
have aligned with their
respective 'Animus'...
Dan, Joseph, Gad...
have each been aligned
with a surface dweller
as their 'Animus'...

Hyuga's Asher,
Ramsus' Zebulun,
Krelian's Judah,
Sophia's Dinah...

Reuben, Simeon, Levi,
and Issachar were already
aligned 500 years ago...

And finally...
Grahf's Naphtali...
All of the 'Anima Relics'
have now been activated.

The identity of the
-Persona- mask of the
'mother' has also
become clear.

The time has come.

Now is the time to open
the door to god's domain
to attain the fleshly body
and the wisdom of god...

The time of the true
awakening...
To carry us to new
horizons...
Yes, the time of the
gospel has come...!

Now, humans!
Extol the awakening
of god!

The fleshly body of god
has been recovered...

The Anima and the Animus
have all been obtained...

All that is left for us
to do is change into the
Animus, and become one with
the mother -Persona-...

Krelian
"...That is incorrect."

What?
What do you mean, Krelian?
What did you just say?

What are you doing!?
Krelian, have you gone
totally insane!?

What are you doing
to the memory banks!?

Do not touch them!
We cannot survive
without them...!

Krelian
"You were the only
ones who could have
activated the key...
But now that it has been
activated, I no longer
need you. I am having
you all erased."

How dare you!

Krelian
"The only obstacle that
kept me from my goals was
Cain.
He was the one person who
had total control of the
people and thus was my
greatest nemesis.
But the only person who
could terminate Cain was
Cain himself.
That's why I created...
'a copy of Cain'.
Ramsus acted exactly as I
predicted...killing Cain.
Now, there is no one who
can stop 'me'.
And I'm not interested in
your power or authority.
Did you really think you
were acting on your own
free will? You are all
just parts of the system.
Created only as weapons of
invasion and oppression...
You are just terminal
interface weapons."

We...can...
become...god!
And...you're...

Krelian
"God?
Who said you'd be god?
What impertinence!
We are 'humans'. We were
created to be terminal
interfaces of god.
It is the same for you,
who were once humans.
'Man cannot become god.'
...We can only entrust
ourselves to god."

Ri...diculous...
Going... a...gainst
the... Mother...

Krelian
"I have not gone against
her. This is the will of
the 'other mother'."

You...think...you...
can...elim...inate...
us...and...still...
...revi...ve...god...?

Krelian
"It can be done.
Your genes were scattered
in order to keep the world
alive after the 'Fall' in
days of destruction.
Those genes live on today
within the humans.
The -Anima- vessels...
and the recipients of their
alignment, the -Animus-...
and also the -Persona-...
By combining these with my
nanomachines, humans will
become living beings very
much the equivalent of you.
Actually, they may far
surpass you in becoming
worthy terminal interfaces
for god.
So you are no longer of
any use to me. -Deus-, the
physical manifestation of
god, only wants results...
The means are insignificant
to him...
So this is my 'Ark Plan'...
My -Project Noah-!"

K...re...li...

Krelian
"May all your worries
cease. Rest in peace...
ancestors of mortal man!"

Krelian
"Now, it is just
you and I...Sophia!"

watching us."

Sigurd
"Close each section down
completely and commence
independent operation!!"

Sigurd
"That's alright!!
...Either way, it's
impossible to save
the entire ship.
Our priority is to
secure the bridge!!
Gather everyone
into the bridge
immediately!"

Sigurd
"...Hyuga... No...
you're Citan now.
You need to get out.
I'll have Maison
guide you to an
escape-pod."

Sigurd
"We have no right to keep
you here and get you
involved.
...If you see Kahr and
Miang, make sure you
pay'em back for me."

Sigurd
"Maison...
Please show him the way."

Sigurd
"What?
More details!"

Citan
"I cannot leave you
all like this...!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Sigurd!!!"

Citan
"...I am being carried
by the wind to the
vicinity of the border...
...What is that?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1160
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Save current data?
    Save
    Don't save

Continue the game?
    Wait
    Continue

Citan
"That...is...the...Dora.
It was stationed here?
That was careless of me...
But its condition...
.........
It is just like the others
that 'he' destroyed..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1162
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"No, Elly!
Return immediately!!"

Elly
"I'm going to do this...
So please, allow me to do
it!"

Citan
"It is too dangerous!"

Elly
"I know...
But, it's just like when
Fei put his life on the
line to save me...
It's my turn to save Fei...
As long as it helps him,
I don't care what happens
to me!"

Citan
"Elly..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Elly resists Id - file31
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"!!
Ugh..."

Elly
"Guh...Fei...
I, I won't ever
let go!"

Elly
"Uuaaahhh...
Fei!
Please!!"

Elly
"...Fei."

Elly
"...Yes.
If that is what will
satisfy you, then kill
me. Now..."

Elly
"Fei...
Please, return to
the real Fei!!"

Id
"Heh... You.
You've come to
die, eh?"

Id
"Hmph...
Good girl...
Now, die!"

Id
"!?
Let go..."

Id
"Errgaah!!
W, what!?"

Id
"Tch...
...This woman...
I knew it..."

Id
"... Damn... it...
He's...
awake...ning..."

Fei
"... Uuuhhh...
El...ly..."

Bingo!
Our information was
correct. It's Kislev's...
It's huge...
It appears to be a...

That's it! The Goliath!
The one from the
underground factory we've
heard so much about!!
Crap...they're taking
revenge! Bet they're going
to bomb Bledavik!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1170
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Received a telegram
from Shevat!
Due to a weakening
gate, a city that
may be Solaris has
been discovered!!

Fei
"...
...Let's...see..."

Fei
"What the hell is it
saying?"

Fei
"Huh...?"

Fei
"H, hey you.
My name is Fei.
Not Kim."

Fei
"...Kim is fine..."

Fei
"...Father?..."

Fei
"Huh?...Uh yeah."

Fei
"Hey..."

Fei
"Umm..Oh...
...By the way,
do you have a name?"

Fei
"Okay, okay.
Emeralda, right?
Alright, Emeralda.
I'll stay with you this
time. I promise!"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"Does Fei resemble
someone you know?"

Elly
"Kim? The person
resembling Fei, right?
Who is he? Is he the one
who created you?"

Elly
"It seems you resemble
him. Someone important
to her...
probably the person
who created her..."

Elly
"Really."

Elly
"Old lady...!
Maybe I should bury
her back at the
ocean floor..."

Elly
"Why don't you be her
Kim? The Fei...Kim!!"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"Fei...?
You mean, he resembles
someone you know?"

Elly
"Kim? The person
resembling Fei, right?
Who is he? Is he the one
who created you?"

Elly
"Sounds like you
resemble him. Someone
important to her...
probably the person
who created her..."

Elly
"Really."

Elly
"Old lady...!
Maybe I should bury
her back at the
ocean floor..."

Elly
"Why don't you be her
Kim? The Fei...Kim!!"

Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim!
Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim!
Kim! Kim!

What do you mean by
'resemble'? Kim is Kim?

What do you mean by
'creating me'?
Kim is Kim!
Don't you see?

Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim!
Kim! You're really here!
I thought I was dreaming.
The person in my dream.
Yes, Kim! I was dreaming!
A long long dream.

Now I know, Fei's Kim!
Listen, listen, I was
dreaming! A long long
dream!

Listen, listen, Kim!
I was dreaming about 
really old times.
Kim was much older,
and I was in some clear
tube...
Kim was...putting many 
candles on a white soft
confection...
I didn't know why he
was doing that...
But I sensed he was 
looking forward to me
coming out of the tube...

...
But...soon everyone... 
was gone...
My body disappeared...
Then I was in somewhere
dark for a long...
long time...

Please! Promise you'll
stay, Fei's Kim!?

Really?
Really truly?

Don't bother me!
Who is this old lady?
I'm talking to Kim!

Oh no! You're cruel,
Fei's Kim!
It's me, Emeralda,
Emeralda!
Kim named me because
I have emerald hair!
Don't you remember...?

Emeralda
"Really? Really truly?
Yeah!"

Citan
"For her, 'Kim' means
more than just a name.
...More like...'father'."

Citan
"No, no, I mean it has
general meaning."

Citan
"...I doubt Krelian acted
on his own to use her as a
disposable soldier.
Some information existed
in her which passed over
to Krelian.
Who knows what he will
do next.
We must find Solaris
before that happens..."

Citan
"Perfect!!
Let us go back to
Shevat for now!"

Citan
"For her, 'Kim' means
more than just a name.
...More like...'father'."

Citan
"No, no, I mean it has
general meaning."

Citan
"...I doubt Krelian acted
on his own to use her as a
disposable soldier.
Some information existed
in her which passed over
to Krelian.
Who knows what he will
do next.
We must find Solaris
before that happens..."

Citan
"Perfect!!
Let us go back to Shevat
for now!"

Bart
"Thanks for saving
us, Old Maison!"

Bart
"I feel bad you had
to get involved...
I appreciate it.
...But I had no idea
you could operate
such a thing."

Maison
"Young master, let's go
back to the bridge."

Maison
"Please raise your head.
My duty is to protect
the young master. I'm
sorry it took me so
long to help you."

Maison
"It's a trick I picked
up long ago...
It's nothing special.
I'm no expert on it.
I'm actually a bit
embarrassed about it."

Maison
"The young master's cup..."

Maison
"Is something bad
going to happen
to him...?"

Sigurd
"Young master!
The Royal Capital's
armies are returning!
We were the ones who took
the bait. We must escape
before we get caught!
Head for the bridge as
soon as you are through
with your preparations!"

Shakhan...
The more I see him, the
more odious he gets.
He's lost some hair too.

Young master!
Don't be discouraged
by this!

I was worried
when Maison came
in that thing.

By the way, I heard he
was the personal knight
and bodyguard of the
previous king...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"That someone was
waiting for you...
That one thought was
all it took for you
to regain yourself...
You are a great man,
Sigurd..."

Citan
"So we are too late..."

Citan
"Nanomachines are
robots that are smaller
than human cells.
They are used to cure
diseases or wounds in
Solaris.
...She may be a colony
of nanomachines made
by an ancient, but
advanced technology."

Citan
"I am worried about what
Bishop Stone mentioned.
He said he needed her
 'to free humanity
 from its yoke'.
Perhaps some ancient
information on human
reconstruction is hidden
inside of her body...
Demihumans, such as Rico
and Hammer were born from
the results of the messing
around with D.N.A....
That was done by ancient
Solaris' in the hopes that
it would bring about the
restoration of mankind.
If Krelian is thinking of
trying the same thing with
improved nanotechnology...
that would be frightening."

Sigurd
"Why such a glum face?
Tomorrow is our first
return to your castle
in 12 years."

Sigurd
"You'll get used to it."

Sigurd
"Yes?"

Sigurd
"I was kidnapped by Solaris
and brainwashed for use as
a human guinea pig."

Sigurd
"But, even they couldn't
erase my desire to return
home.
Then, I remembered you and
Marguerite, not as the
royalty of our country but
as just normal children.
I don't care about
rebuilding a dynasty.
I want to regain this
kingdom because it
belongs to you...
Because it's your home!"

Sigurd
"Yes.
For that, we must take
Shakhan down tomorrow.
Am I correct?"

Sigurd
"But first...
I think you need
to take a bath!"

Sigurd
"You don't look
like a king at all!
You are facing the
enemy's leader...
so you must have a
noble appearance!"

Sigurd
"That is that,
this is this!"

Bart
"Returning to the castle...
After we get the royal
palace back, I guess I'm
going to be the king...
...I'm not very suited for
it, am I?"

Bart
"Listen, Sig..."

Bart
"I guess it really...
doesn't matter who the
king is, does it?
As long as it's a symbol
of hope, right?
It doesn't have to be me."

Bart
"Because it's my home?"

Bart
"...Right.
Then, let's do it!!"

Bart
"A bath!?"

Bart
"Hey, you just said it
didn't matter whether
I'm a king or not!!"

Bart
"Citan, so someone named
Krelian took the kid. So
what?
What the heck is a
nanomachine, anyway?"

Bart
"...Then, what's the prob?
It's good for people,
right?
It just irritates me that
it's all only for Solaris."

Billy
"Citan, so what happens
now that Krelian took the
child?
What is a nanomachine
anyway?"

Billy
"Even if it's only for the
people of Solaris...
What's wrong with making
people happy?"

Rico
"Citan, someone named
Krelian took the kid,
so what?
What is a nanomachine,
anyway?"

Rico
"...Then, what's the prob?
It's good for people,
right?
But it irritates me that
all of them are for
Solaris."

Fei
"...Don't call me 'son'.
Cuz you sure ain't my
pops."

Fei
"You too..."

Fei
"...Don't jinx yourself!
It's not like you...
But...I'll take care
of them. Don't worry."

Bart
"Though the warship is
outdated, you're only
going in as a small unit.
It's going to be a tough
fight, but you could
change Aveh's future.
I'm counting on you."

Bart
"Fei, it's odd for me to
say this since I'm the one
who got you involved...
but...be careful, okay!?"

Bart
"If...anything happens
to me...take care of
Margie and them for me!"

Maitreya
"Each squad of Gears take
off, in order, from here
to avoid being picked up.
We'll meet at the Rockies
by the border tomorrow at
1200.
Got it?"

Maitreya
"Leave it up to us,
young master! 
We'll drag Vanderkaum's 
tail around and around!!"

Maitreya
"Right, son!?"

Maitreya
"Huh? Ha, ha, ha, ha..."

Maitreya
"Well, young master...we
promise to make something
out of this battle!"

O.K.!

I'm pumped!

The time has
finally come.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigurd
"Marguerite is straining
herself. Young master, you
should be kinder to her."

Sigurd
"...I'll stay here a
little longer. I have
some thinking to do."

Sigurd
"Citan?
No, I haven't seen him...
You don't need to worry
about him. He'll be fine."

Sigurd
"Well, Marguerite, now that
we have saved you, may we
ask you one thing...?
Why did you go up against
the enemy by yourself?"

Sigurd
"Obviously a groundless
rumor started by the enemy
in order to lure you out."

Sigurd
"Marguerite..."

Sigurd
"Marguerite is straining
herself. Young master,
you should be kind to her."

Bart
"Then...you thought you
could save them alone!?
That was stupid!!"

Bart
"Margie!!"

Bart
"Next time, let us know!!
We'll go for you!"

Margie
"Sorry...but...
I heard a rumor in
town that day...
It was said that the
Sect's sisters who
were captured by Aveh
were still alive..."

Margie
"I believed it!
So what!?
I was wrong.
But..."

Margie
"But...grandma and mom
were already executed..."

Margie
"Sorry...to drag everybody
into this. I'll never do
it again..."

Margie
"Yeah...
I'll do that."

Maison
"Please, don't be
so hard on her...
The Nisan Sect is
Marguerite's home.
It's perfectly
understandable."

Maison
"At any rate, Marguerite
is here unhurt.
That's the main thing!
Before luck runs out,
let's take Marguerite
to Nisan. We can talk
more there.
Now, I'll go prepare
Marguerite's room...
Miss Marguerite, may I
ask you to accompany me?"

Fei
"Elly!!"

Fei
"Elly!!"

Fei
"Doc!
What is this..."

Fei
"Hypnosis...?"

Bart
"I don't get it. At least
when I saw her up there,
she didn't have the eyes
of a traitor."

Bart
"It broke again just after
getting restored. What am
I gonna do..."

Bart
"I knew it all along...
This moll's a mole!"

Bart
"Damn it! What the hell
did she do!? What am I
gonna do!!"

Bart
"Fei!!
Are you leaving her
here like this?"

Bart
"Fei!!
Where are you going?"

Bart
"Fei!!
This is no time to play
with Martle!!"

Bart
"...Citan, if you thought
it was suspicious, you
shoulda stopped her."

Elly
"..."

Elly
"It's an animal, so
it can't help it.
By the way, the first
mate wants to see you."

Elly
"...
Fei...?"

Citan
"...She was given some
strong hypnosis."

Citan
"It is a special hypnotism
that makes a person behave
in a pre-programmed way.
A special condition serves
as a switch to act...but
until then no strange
behavior can be detected.
She looked strange when
coming out of the medical
room, so I followed her."

Citan
"Well, if you forcibly
stop the behavior while
imprinting,
occasionally
it destroys the mind...
But it is true that I
reacted a little late..."

Citan
"It may take a while to
fix it..."

Citan
"Anyhow, we will take her
to the medical room first.
Fei, go to the room when
you are done here. No need
to worry. The hypnotist
must have been a good one.
There are no mental scars."

Citan
"Wait! Do not worry about
her. Stopping this is our
priority."

Citan
"There...
How is this..."

Did she do this...
Hypnosis?
...That's pretty
damned underhanded
even for Solaris!

How badly are the main
engines damaged? I need
more time to see them
closely...
But it looks pretty bad.
It may take a while.

Whaaat's up? Martle? Eh?
Huh?

Hey, Miss.
I heard you got caught.
Are you okay?

Easy, Martle!
It's just the Solarian
girl. You don't need
to bark!

...Oh?
Oh, I see.
Sorry.

Wha, what's going on?
Young master,
have you done it again?

Bart
"Either way, no need to
let him go so fast...
right...?"

Bart
"Gunner!"

Bart
"Franz!"

Bart
"Here we go!
BattCon level 1!"

Bart
"Battle stations, everyone!
Surface navigation!
Close the vents!
Blow the main tank!
Prepare for anti-aircraft
battle upon surfacing!"

Bart
"Surface-combat!
Stand by with the
anti-aircraft guns.
Gunner!
Give me the trigger
for the Bart Missiles!"

Bart
"What's up?"

Bart
"We're near the capital.
It's probably just some
kind of ship from there."

Bart
"Under the sand?
This is the only sand
cruiser in all of Aveh!"

Bart
"...Alright!
We'll start!
Ready the shuttle boats!"

Bart
"When we land,
hide the ship!"

Bart
"It's alright,
Old Maison."

Bart
"We'll go back to Nisan!"

Bart
"Margie and them are still
there. We'll go back!
We have to!
That reminds me...
What about Fei and his
guys? If they're alright,
we could..."

Bart
"Dammit!
This can't be happening!"

Bart
"Behind...?"

Bart
"Something's coming
from behind!
Jerico! Give me the helm...
No, you keep it!
Just hurry up and pull
either way!!"

Bart
"Battle stations!
Deploy the maskers!
Ready the noisemaker!"

Battle stations, everyone!

Bart
"Emit noisemaker! Prepare
to stop the engine!"

Bart
"Helm... NOW! Steer
to the opposite direction
as far as you can!
Stop the engine!
Crash alarm!!"

Stop the engine! 
Crash alarm!!

Franz
"I don't hear anything
other than the surface
wind waves and our engine.
Threat is minimal from
looking at the radar
and sonar."

Oh...?

Franz
"No...for a moment, I
thought I caught some
unnatural sounds..."

Franz
"But it's not from the
surface... It's from
under the sand!"

Franz
"...I can't catch it again.
It could have been a sand-
whale..."

Franz
"There...
On the surface layer!
I'm detecting sounds of
anchors being weighed
in and engines being
activated!
The Royal Capital's
defense fleet must
be departing...!"

Franz
"We've had no contact
since we confirmed their
order to charge..."

Franz
"Aft of our stern! 300!
I'm picking up the sound
of torpedoes being readied!
A sand cruiser!? It's big!
Speed 60! Relative route
0-0-0! They were hiding
behind some baffles!"

Franz
"I'm picking up some high
speed propulsion, breaking
away from the enemy's ship!
Torpedoes!? Two of them!
Speed 87!
Torpedoes confirmed with
the sonar.
They've shifted over to
active homing!"

Franz
"Torpedo...1, still
pursuing! Dammit!
Impact in 3!!"

Gungany...
No, Bart Missile, fueling!
It'll take fifteen seconds
from opening the hatch
to engage the illuminator!

Young master!
I'm detecting an increase
in the use of F Band!
That's the Royal Capital's
defense force's frequency!

We also intercepted a
transmission from the
patrol at the border
with Kislev!
They're requesting
immediate backup from
the Royal Capital!
Looks like we've
really raised some
hell at the border!

Open jammer!
Noisemaker, 2nd, 4th
tube...Standby!

But first mate!
Now with the effect-fins out
of order, if you run at full
speed, the ship wouldn't be
able to stand the friction!!

First mate!!

Maison
"Y, young master!
The Gungany Missiles...
You need permission from
more than a half of the
crew members to..."

Maison
"Y, young master!
What is happening?
What was the alarm
all about...?"

Maison
"Y, young master!
I have an awfully bad
feeling about this...
Do be very careful!"

Maison
"Y, yes...young master...
I hear when they attacked
the fort at the border,
the Gebler, led by Ramsus,
routed them.
We'd better withdraw for
now, and reconsider..."

Maison
"Young master..."

Sigurd
"Young master! Again!!?"

Sigurd
"Just doesn't know
when to give up..."

Sigurd
"We haven't heard anything
about a new ship even from
the spies at Aveh Naval HQ.
Franz, can you try again
and confirm what it is?"

Sigurd
"It's useless!
Young master!"

Sigurd
"Young master...?"

Sigurd
"Kahr!"

Sigurd
"Young master!!!"

Sigurd
"Engine, ready for full
power!! Jerico! Give me
the helm over here!"

Sigurd
"It can 'jump' due to the
Bernoulli effect on the
wings' surfaces instead!!"

Sigurd
"Never mind that!
The Yggdrasil is nothing
without the young master!
Full power!!
Maximum speed!!"

Sigurd
"Eeeeeaaaaarrrrgghh!!!!
Come on, GO!!!"

Sigurd
"Seems like they're
watching us."

Yggdrasil Gun Room - 1182

Maison
"...sob...sob...
Oh to think that Marguerite
has now returned...
Come to think of it, this
is the second time we have
had to flee from the Royal
Capital.
It seems an awful long
time ago...
That night that I took
them with me to escape..."

Bart
"Yeah and on top of that he
was bold enough to steal
this ship along the way.
You know this used to be
the kingdom's flagship?"

Maison
"Yes, it was all Sigurd's
doing. So courageous of him
even at such a young age.
Anyway, this Yggdrasil can
be considered as a keepsake
of the late king for the
young master."

Bart
"It kinda feels like you're
stuck to me for life.
Even though you used to be
my personal knight, right?
Now I'm just a kid pirate!"

Maison
"But eventually you will
become a proud lord."

Bart
"I gotta hurry up and
grow up or I'll never
be proud of myself.
And I won't be able
to win against him!"

Maison
"..."

Masion
"Oh, aren't you going
to rest up a little?"

Maison
"It appears the final
hour is approaching...
If need be, this Maison
will also take up arms
and come to your aid!!"

Maison
"We may not be able to come
along, but will be praying
for your safety."

Maison
"...
I have nothing to look
back on that I regret!"

Maison
"My, hasn't it gotten
lively around here."

Maison
"Do be careful now..."

Maison
"Master Billy is
waiting for you
over yonder..."

Maison
"A mature yet modern
atmosphere... That is
what I offer you...
A bartender's life isn't
all that bad you know!"

Maison
"For people from a heathen
nation like us to receive
such charity...
My word, god is so very,
very tolerant...

Maison
"Miss Elly...
and then Master Fei...
Why do we continue to have
misfortunes like this?"

Maison
"Miss Elly...
What kind of spell
was used on her?"

Maison
"Y...young master!
I heard all about it.
International amity
with the Thames!?
Indeed..."

(...Sob...sob...
This old man's efforts
weren't all wasted!)

Maison
"I have no idea where we
are. It's not on the map, 
either..."

Maison
"Oh! Doctor Uzuki.
I'm sorry to put you
out so much...
We should've stopped
the young master...
I am terribly sorry!"

(Uh...uh...uh......!
My chronic lumbago has
gotten worse since
I hustled in Aveh...)

Maison
"At long last we are
heading to Bledavik
tomorrow...
Though he is the prince,
our young master doesn't
know the Royal Capital
very well...
I'd always felt that was
an awful pity. But despite
that, I tried my best to
raise him as Crown Prince.
However, looking back, I
might have put too much of
the 'burdens of kingship'
on him too early in life...
And it might have been too
much for a child with a
future like his to handle.
...
I must be the most
terrible minder ever!"

Citan
"My dear Lord Maison...
I hardly think that
is right!
The young one would have
taken the burden off of
himself had he not wanted
to bear it any longer!
He is a fine man now...
far capable of handling
any such burdens or
pressures.
And I believe you are
the very ones who have
given him the strength
to do so."

Maison
"Oh my good
Doctor Uzuki..."

Maison
"Let us head for Aveh.
To save Miss Marguerite!!"

"How may I be of service?"
    Items
    Weapons/Accessories
    Nothing now, thanks.

Maison
"Oh, young master...!
If the young master doesn't
come here more often to
receive an education fit for
a prince, then old Maison,
who is in charge of his
upbringing, will disgrace
the very memory of King
Edbart IV... god bless him.
Typical of the young master
not to even listen to me!
The king was peace-loving,
a very generous person...
On the contrary, not only
does the young master, put
his name on a missile, but
goes and shoots an unknown
airplane with it.
To make the matters worse,
his good friend Fei and
company were onboard it..."

Maison
"Anyway, one must apologize
to Doctor Uzuki and his
friend Master Rico, right!?
They were on their way
toward the Gear Hangar..."

Citan
"I am sure Elly is alive
and well. If we just go on
believing it...!"

Citan
"I would be more than
happy to come along!!"

Citan
"No one can stop our
old friend now...!"

Citan
"I would be more than
happy to come along!!"

Citan
"Young one,
I see you got on well with
the captain of the Thames.
I guess that was expected.
He is a man of the sea,
the type of person you
would admire..."

Sigurd
"...
Oh, yes... It's time for
you to depart, right.
I'm sorry, old friend,
but I have a job I must
do..."

Jessie
"Oh god, is it that time
already? Well then, before
we go let's do the usual...
You know... the 'paint the
face on your stomach and
dance around trick'...?
The three of us together!"

Citan
"!!
Well, actually, we are
in a hurry so, errh...
We will talk about that
some other time..."

Jessie
"Oh? Is that right?
Well then, I oughta get
outta here too, huh!"

Citan
"There is something I
want to ask you too...
So let us get together
when we have more
time...!"

Jessie
"Yeah.
I hope I live to have
the opportunity..."

Citan
"..."

CRASH!!!

Elly
"AAAAAAHHHHH!!
Sigurd is...!"

Citan
"Again!?
Sigurd gets drunk so
easily...!
Well that blows it!
We cannot leave today,
perhaps tomorrow..."

Sigurd
"..."

Jessie
"The keywords are Nikolai,
Maria, 
a huge Gear... eh!?"

Jessie
"Hah...! Just goes to show
the kid needs his parents
around him all the time!"

Jessie
"Ha, ha, ha!!
I haven't hit the booze
for a long while!
It's all cause my son
doesn't let me drink! 
This is a great bar you've
got here... old codger!"

Maison
"Why... errh,
thank you,
my good man."

Jessie
"This old codger, has good
character...like his booze!
I like him!! Ha, ha, ha!"

Ha, ha, ha! 

Ha, ha, ha! 

Shevat Agent
"Originally, Shevat was a
town situated on top of
'Babel Tower'...
They say there was a
communication facility
to contact what now is
Shevat on top of the tower.
If only it still exists
and still works now..."

Phew! I no longer have
to listen to the roars
of the old man any more.

The engine's restoration
is finally finished.
Why don't you go down
the stairs to take a look
at our beautiful engine.

Billy
"It was a long journey...
But what we did was not
in vain. Let's prove it!"

Billy
"I want to journey with
you and find out the
truth about this world!!
You can count on me to
help you anytime!"

Sigurd
"...
Now I see why you came
down to the surface...
Alright, I understand you.
But Kahran Ramsus...
taking over the post of
Aveh is pretty annoying."

Citan
"The home country
might have had some
special reasons."

Sigurd
"Yeah...
obviously."

Citan
"But perhaps there is still
a chance of success...
You and I, who used to be
called 'Elements' at the
commander's training school
'Jugend', are both here!"

Sigurd
"Hope you are right..."

Citan
"By the way, 
she is still...?"

Sigurd
"According to Fei,
there was a female aide
on Kahr's side...
And he said that she had
Indigo blue eyes and hair.
... 
So it must be her..."

Citan
"So all the old 'Elements'
members are on the surface
world now..."

Sigurd
"I guess so..."

Sigurd
"Hyuga...
To be honest with you...
she scares me.
She supports Kahr and
is kind to anyone, 
I know that very well.
But sometimes I felt
a strange fear in her.
That bothers me more than
Kahr being in this land."

Citan
"That cannot be true...
Not in her..."

Sigurd
"Yeah, I don't want to 
believe it, either...
But don't you remember how
I could always sense these
things quite accurately?"

Citan
"Right..."

Citan
"By the way, have you told
the young one yet...?"

Sigurd
"No, not yet.
I don't want him to worry
until we know exactly what
Solaris' objectives really
are.
But I have to tell him 
eventually though...
Anyway, Hyuga, have you
gotten any information?"

Citan
"Not really....
I left there before going
into the center section..."

(Fei!!)

Fei
(Oh, it's you Bart!?
Don't scare me...!)

Bart
(Sorry-dorry.
It sounds like Sig and your
doctor friend know each
other pretty darn well...
Sig...
Damn, I thought I knew
everything about that
guy!)

Fei
(When did doc get back..?)

Jessie
"I see.
This is the place you
begged to return to, eh?"

Sigurd
"Well, yes..."

Jessie
"After you left,
Billy cried a lot."

Sigurd
"...
I'm sorry."

Citan
"When you left Solaris,
the same thing happened.
Kahr was quite upset then."

Sigurd
"I didn't mean to
betray him..."

Citan
"His misanthropy has
gotten even worse
because of that."

Citan
"Now, enough about old
times, old friend.
I did not expect to
find you loitering in
this land..."

Everyone!

Billy
"Good morning.
They said you were still
sleeping, so I went
ahead and came in."

Bart
"You're dressed lightly.
Is that enough?"

Rico
"You're dressed lightly.
Is that enough?"

Billy
"We Etones have some
rather unique equipment.
Let me explain about the
equipment since we're 
going to be working
together."

Billy
"First of all, my basic
equipment are guns.
There're three kinds...
'Handgun',
'Ether-gun',
and 'Big-gun'.
The handgun is the only one
that can be replaced with
other versions of the same
kind.
I made the other two kinds
of guns myself, so there
are no others to replace
them with.
You can power-up a gun's
attack force by changing
its 'ammo' or 'bullets'
with more powerful ones!
To load ammo, press Right
or Left on the Directional
button at the Equip Menu
Screen.
This will display a sub-
window in place of the
main Equip window, where
you can select your ammo.
One thing you have to be
careful of is that the
number of bullets for
each gun is limited.
To successfully manage your
ammo, you must keep an
ample supply and reload
frequently!
But now that I have said
this, note that Ether-guns
do not have such a limit.
Well that's about it...
Did you understand?
    Yes
    No, please explain again

Bart
"I understood it roughly.
But it's a bit complicated,
isn't it?"

Rico
"...I see.
That's very unique..."

Billy
"...This is a fine gun
indeed. I'm sure it has
a significant history."

Bart
"Of course!
It's the famous rifle
'Machiganater', handed down
in the Fatima family."

Billy
"What a waste...
It's too good for you who
just brandishes a whip..."

Bart
"Hey!
Why are you getting
sharp with me!?"

Billy
"Oh, sorry... It's just...
I didn't think you would
have an interest in guns."

Elly
"Well anyway...
Billy...
I'd like to know why you
became an Etone..."

Bart
(I'm not interested...)

Billy
"...
Hmm, I see...
Etones help out strangers,
so I suppose that would
make you curious..."

Elly
"No, I don't mean that.
I'm curious about your own 
intentions, personally.
I don't know...
I just didn't expect you
to be an Etone at all..."

...

Billy
"I see...
Well, since our job is
rather unusual, I'll tell
you about that too as I
explain..."

Bart
"...
Looks like we've
made it already..."

Citan
"...
It looks like we
have arrived..."

Billy
"Can it be...?
The transport ship's being
attacked by Reapers..."

...

...

Billy
"Can anyone help us?"

Billy
"Hah!
This is going to sound
pathetic, but...
I almost went so far as
to sell my body to support
Prim, since we only had
each other for so long...
Despite that, Prim still
prefers the father that she
never knew... The one who
suddenly appeared out of
nowhere..."

Bart
"'Almost sold your body'!?
Don't you know, kid...!?
There're things you can
get back once sold, and
there are things you just
can't!
Couldn't you see that!?"

Billy
"Of course I refrained.
But they said they'd give
me 3000G for one night..."

Bart
"You fool! Listen... Next
time you and your sister
need help, come to my ship.
We're self-sufficient, so
at least you don't need to
worry about food and a
place to sleep!
Now, don't you ever say
'sell your body' in front
of me ever again...!
You understand!?"

Billy
"Could this be...?
Maybe you are a 'nice
guy' after all...?"

Bart
"Why don't you just
come out and say
'thank you'? Geez!"

Billy
"Uh...errh...well...
you haven't taken care of
us yet, so I won't say it!"

Cute, kid, REAL cute!

Elly
"'Sold your body'...?

Billy
"Of course I refrained
from actually doing it.
But they said they'd
give me 3000G a night..."

Elly
"..."

Jessie
"When I was in Solaris, I
found out about the secret
plan...
That was the 'Malakh' (M)
Plan.
And it was done under the
command of Krelian...
In order to proceed with
the plan, many Lambs were
gathered by the 'Ethos',
to become guinea pigs.
Or, should I say, to become
Reapers or -Wels-..."

Jessie
"Since I was disgusted with
Solaris' methods, I decided
to investigate it further.
I found out that the main
scientist central to the M
Plan moved the true facts
about it into a test-Gear.
Then he let that test-Gear
escape with his daughter,
so that the truth would
not be discovered...
And that, I'm afraid, was
the last information that
I was able to obtain..."

Jessie
"Because of what I found
out, I came down to the
surface world...
And this is where I hid,
along with my wife,
Racquel, and son Billy.
I've been looking for
that Gear and the girl
ever since."

Jessie
"Finally, I found out that
the scientist's daughter
and Gear may be in Shevat.
All very well, except now
I don't know how in blazes
to get there, or even how
to contact the place.
Well, Shevat is protected
by a strong barrier that
even Solaris can't do
anything about...
So I guess you can say
it can't be helped...
It's just my luck!"

That girl's name
wouldn't happen
to be Maria...?

Billy
"Oh, are you two alright?
Shouldn't you get some
more rest...?"

Shevat Agent
"Yes, I can stand and
can even walk now...
Thank you."

Fei
"I'm alright, too."

Jessie
"Maria, eh...? Hmm...
If I remember right, her
father's name was Nikolai?"

Shevat Agent
"I don't know that much...
But I have heard rumors
about a girl and a Gear."

Jessie
"Hmm, it's got to be them.
So that huge Gear is in
Shevat then!"

Jessie
"So then... how can we get
to this Shevat? Is there a
way to contact the place?"

Shevat Agent 
"Unfortunately since I was
taken captive I have no way
of contacting them either."

I see...

!!

Shevat Agent
"There just may be a way...!
Originally, Shevat was
situated on top of
Babel Tower.
They say there is a
communication facility to
contact Shevat's native
country on top of the tower. 
If only it still exists..."

Citan
"Hmm...
There is a good
possibility the
facility may have
been destroyed...
Especially when you
consider the fact
that the tower was
sealed by the 'Ethos'."

Jessie
"You're being
pessimistic again..."

Citan
"I am just being
realistic."

...

Bart
"I guess we have no choice
but try and go there.
As long as the gate exists,
we can't escape from
Solaris' influence anyway.
In other words, even if we
recover Aveh from Shakhan,
it wouldn't immediatley be
a happy ending."

Billy
"I think we have no
choice but to try
and go there...
Either way, as long
as the gate exists we
can't escape from the
shadow of Solaris."

Citan
"Their 'secret plan' 
bothers me, too...
The real secret is that
they are using humans
gathered from earth..."

Fei
"But I don't quite get this
secret plan and the 'Ethos'
involvement and so on...
What in the hell does
Solaris think us surface
dwelling humans are!?"

Fei
"...Sorry.
I totally forgot that it
was your country..."

Elly
"What my country's doing...
has nothing to do with me.
I myself thought something
was wrong there, and that's
why I came here...
So, don't worry about me.

Fei
"We've got nothing to lose,
so let's try to go there.
We need to find the truth
about those documents found
in the 'Ethos' H.Q. and
what Billy's father said.
And I must go to Shevat
too for my own personal
reasons anyway."

Fei
"No time like the present,
huh!? Let's go to Babel
Tower right away!"

Yggdrasil Crew Quarters - 1184
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's beyond my ability
to understand, but...
regardless, I'm counting
on you!
No one else can do this!

We won't see each other
for a while, but I will
pray for your success!

We're gonna break up...is
what I'd like to say but,
at this point, we'll stick
with you to the end!!

I didn't think it
really could fly!
Who would've guessed!?

(I hope I'll have
a pretty bride!)

Let's finish them
in one stroke!!

The nurse came looking for
Fei...
But perhaps the nurse's care
was so bad that Fei ran away!

It's more like a monster
ship than a ghost ship...

Ghost ship...
I bet it's one those things
where you get blood coming
out of the showers...
Watch out for the shower!

Who was that man...?
I could hear his voice
echo from the hall.

What!
Fei has recovered!?
That's a miracle!!

Fei was a nice guy...
I'll never forget
your kindness...

Elly would never do
anything like that!!
I believe in her...

Elly is resting in the
medical room across from
here. I bet she can't
sleep in a shabby place
like this.

Even in a foreign country,
there are people willing
to help.
I bet this place has an
understanding boss.
I'm so touched by it...

They blame us for destroying
Aveh's troops! I don't get it!
The explosion of the Gebler
sand cruiser's reactor was to
blame, wasn't it?
Even if we return to Ignas, we
are just going to be targets
for them!
This sucks!!

You were on the Goliath?
Hey, I tried stopping the
young master, ya know.

Professor, we have a big
job to do tomorrow! 
Even if you can't sleep,
you should at least lie
down!

(Actually, I'm too excited 
to go to sleep myself...)

Marguerite's become
stronger since the
last time I saw her.
She is indeed the
true Great Mother
of Nisan.

Here I go again!

I've got to work hard
for my daughter's future!

In this mission, the
Yggdrasil won't be able
to act as a lifeboat...
So be careful!

I've never been so
touched since my
daughter was born...
We've been through
many hardships, and
lost many friends...
but I now know it
was all for a just
cause!

That Shakhan,
better have his
tombstone ready!!

We must stay here
for a while...

I thought the Gear
left a while ago...
Didn't it...?

That was one huuuge Wels!

Ghost ship!?
Yeesh, now I feel
like a real pirate!

Sigurd headed toward the
gun room with some strange
man just a minute ago...
Sigurd didn't look too happy.

I see, I see,
so you're alright...
But I wouldn't depend
on the nurse.
Ha, ha, ha!!

What? First the girl,
and now Fei...!?
This is horrible!

Did she lose her temper
and almost destroy the
engine room?
Young girls these days
just don't know when to
stop!

Elly was acting strangely.
Did she have a fight...?
Being young is great.
I used to be like that
when I was your age.

We're real 'pirates' at
last. But, now I kinda
miss life in the sand.

Young master, it's a
great feeling to see
a renewed Yggdrasil.
But it still feels the
same since we only
relocated our habitat.

Many of our friends
have passed away...
We sometimes wonder if
what we're doing is
right, but someday, I
know peace will come!

When the young master
becomes a king, I wonder
if they'll forget about my
bill at the bar in Aveh.

They said to stand by
inside the ship.
But I want to get off at
Nisan.

Hey?
That professor dressed
in green isn't with you?

When will I be able to see
my daughter again?
I guess I'm gonna have to
end this war first...!!

Get enough rest and
be ready for the
decisive battle!

Young master, you want to
sleep here, too? Trust me,
you shouldn't do that...

Oh! Are you Rico, the
Battling Champ? I'm
originally from Kislev.
It's great to meet you!!

Well, I'm no longer the
Champ. So there's no
need to get so excited.

I may not be so handsome,
but I do have a fiancee
back home...
but my hometown is Kislev.
When the young master becomes
the king of Aveh, I wonder
if I'll be able to see her?

This is where we rest.
Do you want to rest, too?
    Yes
    No thanks

It's a little messy
so bear with it.

See ya.

See you later.
Let me know when
you want to rest.

My goodness, Bart!
Where is Fei?
You had a fight again?
Oh my...

As long as you're alive,
I'll be happy.

My goodness, Bart did such
an admirable act!
He used to be such a
mischievous child...
When he was young he was
so stubborn! But he had a
strong sense of justice.
I'm so proud of him.

I have no idea what Bart
and you are doing, but if
something happens, I'll
back you up! No worries!

I've decided to work here,
I hope you don't mind...
So, have you met my stupid
husband acting all big and
mighty in the engine room?
He's got a bad mouth, but
deep down he's a good man.

The Mary card collection...
I'm having a difficult
time collecting them all...

Yggdrasil Bridge - 1186
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigurd
"Young master, according to
Margie, there's quite a
troublemaker in Gebler."

Bart
"Yeah...
So, who the heck is he?"

Sigurd
"Kahran Ramsus of the Holy
Solaris Empire's Special
Foreign Affairs Agency...
In other words, he's the
commander in chief of
Gebler.
It seems that Gebler isn't
just after the excavation
sites around Aveh after
all."

Bart
"You mean, they're not
after the Jasper?"

Sigurd
"If that's their only goal
they wouldn't need to send
an important man like him!
Young master, this could
become unexpectedly
complicated..."

Fei
"Doc hasn't come
back yet, has he?"

...

Sigurd
"Hyu... I mean, 'doc'...
No need to worry about him.
He'll join us soon."

Sigurd
"Deus integrated with
Zohar and awoke...
But we've found out Deus
is in the center of the
giant structure created
out of the fallen Merkava.
The only way we can think
of to destroy Deus is to
penetrate into there and
make our way to the center.
That structure used to be
Merkava itself, but we
must assume the inside has
changed significantly.
We don't know what dangers
await inside of there.
Please be very careful.

Fei
"Yeah, thanks Sigurd.
Let me take care of it.
I will destroy Deus.
Even if it costs me
everything I have..."

Bart
"Fei...
Are you sure
about this?"

Fei
"Bart...?"

Bart
"I know what you must be
thinking now.
If you destroy Deus...
...the proliferation of the
nanomachines that are out
to turn this planet itself
into a weapon will stop...
But, if you end up losing
Elly who was united with
Deus for that very purpose,
then what good will it be?"

Bart
"Fei...
Are you sure
about this?"

Fei
"Bart...?"

Bart
"I know what you must be
thinking now.
If you destroy Deus...
...the proliferation of the
nanomachines that are out
to turn this planet itself
into a weapon will stop...
But, if you end up losing
Elly who was united with
Deus for that very purpose,
then what good will it be?"

Fei
"But..."

Sigurd
"That's right, Fei.
She's our friend who's been
through a lot with us too.
I think that saving a dear
friend is just as important
as protecting our planet or
saving the world...
What better reason is there
to fight? If you can't even
save your friends, then how
could you save the world?
Don't you agree?"

Bart
"Yeah, Sig's right!
Don't you ever give up,
Fei, no matter what!
You're the only one
who can release Elly
from Deus' spell.
But, we'll give you as
much backup as we can.
So..."

Bart
"Yeah, Sig's right!
Don't you ever give up,
Fei, no matter what!
You're the only one
who can release Elly
from Deus' spell.
But, we'll give you as
much backup as we can.
So..."

Fei
"Thanks a lot.
Bart, Sigurd...
I won't give up."

Sigurd
"You volunteered to fight
for the young master and
the rest of us.
So it's our turn to fight
for you and Elly.
Let's go, Fei...
to gain true freedom!!"

Sigurd
"We don't have much time
left. Let's go, to win
ourselves true freedom!!"

Sigurd
"Ready to go to Sargasso?"
    Sure!
    Wait a minute!

Sigurd
"It seems Fei isn't
in the infirmary...
But he must be
onboard somewhere..."

Sigurd
"Let's head to the
excavation site."

Sigurd
"Let's hurry to
the Thames!!"

Sigurd
"Some new parts were
brought into our Gear
Shop down below.
Why don't you go and
check them out!?"

Sigurd
"We have arrived at the
transport ship.
Be careful now, Billy..."

Sigurd
"Good morning.
Billy is waiting
in the gun room."

(U...ugh...
Feels like a hangover...)

Sigurd
"Billy is waiting
in the gun room."

Sigurd
"I see. So, Fei'll recover
if he continues to rest.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It seems the orphanage is
located to the southeast of
the 'Ethos' headquarters."

Sigurd
"It appears the 'Ethos'
headquarters is located
to the north of the Thames.
We must hurry up and take
Fei there..."

Sigurd
"That reminds me... Margie
says that she has something
to talk to you about..."

Sigurd
"Fei is unconscious...?"

Sigurd
"How careless of me.
I never thought Elly would
do a thing like that...
Why don't you go and
see how she is, Fei?"

Sigurd
"Young master, where did
you go while we were so
busy...?
An international goodwill
visit with the Thames?
Well, whatever...
Now about those supplies
for the submarine..."

Bart
"Oh, that?
Let me see...order an
additional 16 torpedoes!"

Sigurd
"Yes, sir."

Sigurd
"The young master has
finally started to realize
his position as a king."

Sigurd
"Fei, sorry to ask but...
Would you mind telling the
young master to come here?"

Sigurd
"Young master...
You shouldn't play pranks
in an unknown land!"

Sigurd
"Where one god disdains,
another god shows mercy.
We have to appreciate
people's good intentions."

Sigurd
"Young master...
You should apologize
to the two of them."

Sigurd
"Forgive me, Hyuga...
I couldn't save Fei
and Elly..."

Sigurd
"We shall have to enter
into Nisan through the
secret road.
Let's keep on the lookout
for a lone tree in the
desert as a sign of where
the road lies buried...!"

Sigurd
"It's time to sneak
into Aveh at last.
First of all, our party
should inspect the town
and work out a plan of
action."

Sigurd
"We're almost at the
hideout...
We'll probably stop
there for a while for
supplies and repairs."

Sigurd
"Shall we launch
the Yggdrasil?"
    Go ahead!
    Wait a while.

Sigurd
"We are currently
anchored at Shevat..."
    Leave Shevat.
    Changed my mind.

Bart
"Our Yggdrasil was reborn
with Shevat technology.
This vessel will be
named 'the Third'!"

Bart
"Our Yggdrasil was reborn
with Shevat technology.
This vessel will be
named 'the Third'!"

Sigurd
"The operations are a
bit different from the
previous Yggdrasil.
So you'll have to
learn the workings
all over again!"

Yes!
I'll do my best!

Sigurd
"We're currently anchored
at the Thames..."
    Leave Thames.
    Changed my mind.

Sigurd
"So this is your first
time to see our new
Yggdrasil II...
Let me show you our
reborn vessel's
improved performance!"

Sigurd
"Currently anchored
at Nisan...
    Leave Nisan.
    Changed my mind.

Sigurd
"Currently anchored
at our hideout..."
    Leave the hideout.
    Changed my mind.

Bart
"We went through a
lot together...
But this one's going to
be really tough...
But, we won't die! 
We'll come back alive!
I'll be asking you to
join me again when
this is all over!"

Bart
"I can go anytime!"

Bart
"Sig is drinking in
the gun room."

Bart
"I can go anytime!"

!

If Sigurd passes away,
I will...!

Young master, would
you let me steer once
in a while, please!?

Yahoo!!
He'll let me be an
apprentice helmsman!"

Yggdrasil III can fly
now, thanks to Shevat's 
technology but...
The operations have
changed a little so
I've gotta study
them all over again.
Wanna see my notes?
    Let me see them
    Not right now

1) The <T> button is the
   accelerator.
   It moves you forward
   really fast!!
2) If you press the
   Directional button with
   the <T> button held down,
   you can...
 go down by pressing Up,
 go up by pressing Down,
 and change direction by
 pressing Left or Right.
3) When you want to turn
 quickly, also press the
 L1 button for left, or
 the R1 button for right.
4) You can reverse by
   pressing the R2 button.
5) Press the <S> button
   to go to the bridge.
   Press the <C> button
   to land.
 But note...
 There are places where
 you cannot land, such as
 mountains and forests.
 But then again that was
 the same conditions the
 Yggdrasil had when it
 was a Sand Cruiser.

My name is Bingo, the
apprentice helmsman.
Sigurd has been teaching me
how to operate the Yggdrasil!
Do you want to see my notes?
    Yeah, let me see them
    Not right now, thanks

1) The Yggdrasil can be
   operated just as if you are
   walking... Just use the
   Directional button to move
   in the direction you want.
2) While cruising, if you want
   to stop and disembark in
   your Gear, then just press
   the <C> button.
   To stop and come back to
   the bridge (that is, here),
   press the <S> button.
   From the bridge, you can go
   into the rest of the vessel
   to rest, tune up a Gear,
   weigh yourself and so on!
3) While cruising, press the
   Select button to activate
   the Remote Sensing System.
   It will map your current
   position.
4) When you don't know how to
   get to where you want to go,
   ask the navigation officer,
   Mr. Alei, who's looking in
   the binoculars there.
   He will be able to show you
   the ship's charts.

I can't wait until I become
a fully-fledged helmsman...

The ship's missiles might
not work on that monster...

Suddenly we've gone from
land to air travel...
From two dimensions to
three dimensions...
This is difficult...

Exchange all the torpedo
tubes to missile launchers.
We can shoot Gungany...I
mean, 'Bart Missiles', too!

By the way, how do
you shoot downwards?

So how's the status of
our ammo supplies...
Hmm, maybe we need more
anti-aircraft shells...

The compass we received
from Shevat is great.
You can aim at 15 different 
targets simultaniously!

My dear artillery
guns, keep it up!

The command of view is
better than the desert...
It's ideal for observing
missile detonation.
The giant splashes should
be really easy to spot.

Water torpedoes are
built much more simply
than sand torpedoes.
Thanks to that, their
power is double that of
our previous ship's arms.
But they're expensive.

Man, my legs
move great!

Do they have ammo that
works with our vessel here?
It's about time to change the
radar to water software too!

I didn't think they would
have such a variety of water
torpedoes. Their normal
torpedoes are not bad either.
There're so many of them
that I can't decide...!

It's dry in the desert so
gunpowder burns steadily
and easy to predict.
It'd be great if the
temperature would stay
the same day and night.

This ship's mast is low.
So it'd help if we could
get a Gear to observe
the shells' impacts...
And when the catapults
are opened, you can't
use the main cannon.
Ahh, so many problems...

The azimuth compass wasn't
in its proper position.
I'd better fix it while we
are at an anchorage...

I want to change this to
a firing radar with a
better filter...
Oh, and I'd love a bigger
torpedo tube, too...

Franz
"Oh, young master!
I...I'm not loafing
on the job! Honest!"

...

Franz
"That's too bad...
You could have seen the
world between the static!"

'The Franz Collection'
     Number 

I'm finally getting used
to being in the sky...
But I shouldn't get too
relaxed yet!

I still break into a cold 
sweat everytime I take off
and land.

...In short, it flies
cause it has wings, right?
This is hard to understand!

Hmm, so in water the rudder
has to be gently engaged
before trying to turn.
Guess I learned something.

Wow, to think something
like a Lemora would be
in the ocean... It was
covered in shells!

There was a desert Lemora
plastered all over the 
bottom of the ship.
No wonder we didn't get 
any speed...

...
Let's put more
oomph into it!!

High-speed three-dimensional
maneuvering? ... Impossible!
I'm not a Gear pilot! Hah! But
then again, I've got no choice!

With the booster,
the acceleration
is monsterous!
It's fun though.

How to use the rudder...
Deploy the slats
simultaneously...
like this... Hmm?
What's a Vortex Flow?

...Wingtip-stalls...
hammerhead-stalls...
the Helpst maneuver...
grumble... grumble...

Hmmm, the rudder doesn't work
as well as it did in sand...
It doesn't feel secure or
seem to be reliable at all!

I'm kind of used to it now.
You can move more freely in
the water, once you know how!

We had a lot happen this time.
I'd better take a good look
at those propulsion wheels!

All I've heard is
static since then...
I hope people are still
alive out there...

Shevat uses a special
communication method...
I was ordered to work out
a system to decode it on
our ship... I hope I can!

Three dimension radio
wave lighthouse?
We need new Navi-soft!
And they expect me to
create it all...
Yeah, right...!?

Franz is sulky and
won't help me...

Shevat's communication decoder,
charts of angular cordinates of
the radio wave lighthouse and
it's pulses, table of guidance
communication code settings...
There're so many things we
need to buy.
Things have gotten a lot more
complicated and expensive,
now that we can fly!

Laser communication...
I, I want it so bad...

We had a lot of trouble
with static electricity in
the desert causing noise.

We can use high frequency
radio waves in the water,
but the resolution is low,
so it's hard to make out.

...With the increase in
usable radio waves, my
work load has increased.
I'm happy but I'm busy!

We increased the antennas,
but now I can't keep track
of everything because I
don't have enough selector
channels... Drats!!

Once I get to a good
stopping point I guess I'll
go get me a standard
communications oscillator.

The usable electric waves
have increased, so now the
layout of the antenna mast
needs to be changed too!

Sand conducts sound much
better than air does.
Why, I can hear every
gripe Shakhan says!
Ha... Just kidding!

Our maps are not much
of a help anymore...

Young master, do you have
any idea where we are?
It's not on my map!

It's not on the map...
Where the heck are we?

I got a new map!

Alright then...
Let me know when you
want to see it...
It's no loss to me anyway.

That Jerico is serious!
I should put more oomph 
into it, too!

I thought I'd have more free
time. But I have to fix up
Jerico's mistakes, so now
I'm busier than before...

I hope Jerico doesn't go
learning any more strange
things ever again...

I don't have to do delicate
effect wing movements anymore,
but it's harder to keep
balance than it was on sand.

I must inspect the
extended main tank now.
I'm not used to it yet.

The map needs to be
rewritten because of
what's happened!

If you ignore the time 
scale, there isn't much
change in the workload.

Look! Look!
The aerial picture matches
the map I made a long time
ago...exactly! I'm filled
with such deep emotion.

It's a small world.
I already remember all
the land, sea and air!!

A chart! 
I need to go buy a chart!

The captain here is a
good guy! He taught me
a lot about the sea.
But he's a mean drunk!

I was kind of discouraged
that there are so many
unmapped places...
But at the same time,
I was happy to be able
to write new charts...

The ocean is so huge...
The desert at least had
some kind of landmarks
to look for...
Now I can't just rely
on knowing the land.
I've also got to master
celestial measurement.

Jerico has been careful
lately, so navigation
has been made easier.

Oh, that's the chief
navigator's banana boat.
Look at the map.
The desert may seem to be
flat and boring but it's
actually quite complicated.
It's even worse when you
dive underground...
Unexpected boulders and
underground waterways...
You can't take your eyes
off that map for a second!

The desert changes everyday.
So I rewrite the map with
the information we collect
whenever we're out there.

The map box is the greatest
treasure in the Yggdrasil!
This ship can run amuck
because it has these maps.
They're all hand-made by me!

Bart
"Well if it isn't Doctor
Citan Uzuki and...errh,
his very big friend!
I see you've finally woken
up. I am terribly sorry
about what happened...
Please forgive me..."

Rico
"I have a name, you know...
It's Ricardo Banderas...
But everyone calls me Rico!
So, what are you
apologizing to us for?"

Bart
"...
I suppose I had better stop
beating around the bush...
I'm not usually this frank
or apologetic but, well..."

Citan
"What he is trying to
say is this...
The people who shot us
down, and the people who
saved us, are one in the
same...this ship's crew!"

Rico
"...?
You don't mean...
That Goliath which we
were riding in was shot
down by...?"

Bart
"Yes, you're a bit slow
there...errh, big friend!
Actually our Yggdrasil II
did a good job in shooting
down that monster of an
airplane!! It was great!"

"You should've seen it!
Wow! My 'Bart Missiles'
sure were awesome...!!"

Rico
"AAAARRRGGHHH!!
I won't forgive
you so easily!!"

Sigurd
"Fei, the young master
hasn't come back yet.
What's he up to?
Would it be too much to
ask for you to go and
call him for me?"

Fei
"No problem!
He's probably wining
and dining with the
Captain of the Thames!"

I've detected a rescue signal!
It seems the Thames is being
attacked by a pack of Reapers!

Bart
"So this is the purging
by Solaris that Stone
was talking about!?"

Bart
"So this is the purging
by Solaris that Stone
was talking about!?"

Citan
"Let us make haste!
Otherwise the Thames will
be destroyed by Reapers!"

Citan
"Let us make haste!
Otherwise the Thames will
be destroyed by Reapers!"

Jessie
"What about the 'Ethos'?
They've completely
devastated themselves!
That mob just goes from
bad to worse!"

Citan
"Do you not think it is
about time you told your
son the truth, old friend?
You were not just
wandering around drinking
and picking fights, were
you?
I am sure he wants to
know what you have been
up to...
Is that right, Billy?"

Citan
"Do you not think it is
about time you told your
son the truth, old friend?
You were not just
wandering around drinking
and picking fights, were
you?
I am sure he wants to
know what you have been
up to...
Is that right, Billy?"

Billy
"Yes, it would certainly
make me feel a lot better.
I now know my dad was
worried about me the whole
time, but I haven't worked
out my feelings yet..."

Jessie
"What do you mean?"

Billy
"Well I'm glad Prim can
speak now, but she only
calls out for her father...
But I am the one who has
been taking care of her
all this time...
What's wrong with her...?"

Citan
"Calm down, Billy...
I am sure she is just
being shy.
She will start calling out
for you soon. Why, my own
daughter does not even call
out her father's name!"

Citan
"So, old friend...
Why were you working
alone all that time?"

Citan
"Calm down, Billy....
I am sure she is just
being shy.
She will start calling out
for you soon. Why, my own
daughter does not even call
out her father's name!"

Citan
"So, old friend...
Why were you working
alone all that time?"

Jessie
"It couldn't be helped...
Anyway, I'll probably need
your help from here on..."

Jessie
"Okay, I'll tell you more.
Let's go to the gun room...
to get something to drink."

Fei
"That can't be!"

Billy
"A secondary
explosion...!?"

Citan
"Oh no!
I should have known better.
What a miscalculation!!
The explosion was too big.
It reacted with the main
condenser right under
the main cannon...
...and induced a
secondary explosion...
How could I have been
so stupid!?"

Bart
"You mean,
we overdid it!?"

Citan
"Why did I not
realize it sooner!?
This means...
We might have...
Oh no, Elly...!"

Fei
"Oh...oh my gosh...
Elly...!!"

Billy
"W,what is it,
this time?"

Bart
"Hey, Citan!
What more is going
to happen!?"

Citan
"Something is happening in
the center of Merkava...
What could it be...!?"

Billy
"Thank you for helping
me, everyone.
To be honest, that was
too dangerous for me on
my own. I couldn't have
done it without you..."

Bart
"Is your job always this
dangerous?
Hah, I never thought you
would call a Gear!?
But, what in hell is the
'Ethos' thinking anyway?"

Bart
"Is your job always this
dangerous?
Hah, I never thought you
would call a Gear!?
But, what in hell is the
'Ethos' thinking anyway?"

Billy
"!! ...We Etones
are merely fulfilling
our divine mission!"

Bart
"Sorry... It was wrong of
me to say that. Don't take
it so seriously!
So, you're going to report
back to the 'Ethos' about
your job's results, right?
Well, if you like we shall
give you a ride to the
'Ethos' H.Q...
It's on our way."

Bart
"Sorry... It was wrong of
me to say that. Don't take
it so seriously!
So, you're going to report
back to the 'Ethos' about
your job's results, right?
Well, if you like we shall
give you a ride to the
'Ethos' H.Q...
It's on our way."

Billy
"That would be great,
so long as it doesn't
put you out...
I have something to
give you as a sign of
my gratitude.
So please accompany
me into the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
Let's go..."

Citan
"'Anonelbe'...
The long awaited man of
god, who will take the
people born in this world
with him to a new horizon.
Such is the destiny of
the 'Contact'.
That is what the emperor
called Fei...
He did not tell me why he
called Fei that though..."

Sigurd
"Who the heck is he then?"

Citan
"He is Fei.
But he is also the one
who...
destroyed Elru, caused Kahr
serious injury, sank the
Yggdrasil, killed Rico's
subordinate's in Kislev...
...
Need I continue further?
He is...
...Id.

Sigurd
"What did you say!?
Id!?"

Jessie
"What do you mean?"

Citan
"He...Fei that is, has
Disassociative Identity
Disorder...
Also known more commonly as
multiple personalities."

Jessie
"D...disas...?"

Citan
"Disassociative Identity
Disorder...
or multiple personalities.
It is a mental disorder
where one person has
multiple personalities."

Sigurd
"That can't be real..."

Citan
"Oh but it is very real!
Fei is living proof of it.
I have been watching over
Fei, who has a destroyer
personality within him
named 'Id'."

Citan
"In the beginning he was
stable...
His disassociation did not
occur at all while he
lived in Lahan for those
three years.
But then, after Lahan was
attacked, things changed.
Little by little, the
number of incidences of his
disassociation and their
length began to increase.
And then at Solaris, a
complete manifestation
of Id occurred."

Sigurd
"What brought it about?
He was fine when he
was in Lahan, right?"

Citan
"My guess is that...
the appearance of Grahf
affected Fei somehow.
You probably know that Fei
worked with Grahf as the
assasin 'Id' before he was
brought to live in Lahan.
It was then that Elru,
the homeland of Dominia,
was utterly obliterated.
Grahf was intentionally
provoking the manifestation
of Id 'within'...for want
of a better word...Fei."

Jessie
"For what purpose?"

Citan
"To destroy God...
That is what Grahf
was saying...
That is all I know...
Although there might be
more to it...
But one thing is certain...
Grahf was encouraging the
manifestation of Id, but
did not have adequate
control over him."

Sigurd
"In other words, it
was too much for him
to handle?"

Citan
"Yes."

Jessie
"You said, 'That's all you
know, although there might
be more to it.'...
What did you mean by that?"

Citan
"I shall go on to explain
that now. Actually, that is
the most important point."

Billy
"Well then...
shall we go, too?"

I've picked up the 'Ethos' fleet
and the Thames on the radar, sir.
They're on the sea south of here.
If we travel at full speed we can
reach them in an hour.

Sigurd
"Alright!
Set sail for Thames!"

Aye, aye, sir!

First mate!
The radar sir...!

Sigurd
"What is it!?"

The radar just detected
an enormous object!
It appeared straight
above the fleet!

Bart
"Don't tell me Stone's
there already!?"

Bart
"Don't tell me Stone's
there already!?"

No, it is much
bigger than that!
I estimate it's at
least 2000 sharls!

Billy
"That's gigantic...
What in the heavens
is happening...?"

Citan
"Oh, young one.
Did you want to
talk to me?"

Bart
"Um... About my shooting
down the Goliath... I'm,
errh, really, errh..."

Citan
"Oh, is that it?
I guess it could not be
helped...
But, jumping the gun is
your bad habit.
A king should always keep
calm and judge carefully!"

(Maison says the same thing.)

Bart
"Yeah, I know, I know!
By the way, I have
something to ask you..."

Citan
"Oh?
That is unusual."

Bart
"Well, it's about this
warship we're on...
...which is the same type
as the Yggdrasil.
Years ago, my old man told
me it was scrapped because
the peace talks with Kislev
made progress.
So I knew it existed..."

Citan
"Hmm.
Then, what is
bothering you?"

Bart
"The symbol on the ship...
It's not our Royal Crest!
Look at this."

Citan
"This is..."

Bart
"I thought you knew it.
Whose crest is it?"

Citan
"I am not positive but
it looks like Shevat's."

Bart
"Shevat?
What do you mean?"

Citan
"The Yggdrasil may not
have been made by your
father.
At that time, much of the
potential technology was
not understood and hence,
was hidden.
Maybe your father might
have been scared of its
power and so sealed it
away."

Bart
"Hmm, I see.
So this may not have been
ours from the start.
If so, I wanna meet
the guys who made this
amazing baby."

Citan
"Actually, they may
be closer to you
than you suspect..."

Bart
"Huh?
What did you say?"

Citan
"Nothing...I was just
wondering if Fei and
Elly are alright."

Bart
"...
Sorry, it's my fault."

Citan
"N, no,
I did not mean to...
I am sure they are fine."

Bart
"Though there's no proof to
back it up, I feel better
now that you said that...
Even though I know you're
probably lying through your
teeth to make me feel less
worried..."

Citan
"Anyway, enough worrying...
But I do think you should
apologize to Rico.
You may get more than a
bruise this time though."

Bart
"Yeah."

Citan
"Rico was checking
on his Gear."

What do you wanna do
with your Gear?

Come again.

Oh, Bart!
Thank you for letting me
ride on your Yggdrasil!
I've always wanted to ride
it... It's OK. The children
are safe in Nisan's care!

I heard there was a
shortage of people so I
decided to participate!
Actually, I got fed up
with my job in the small
hideout...

What do you wanna do
with your Gear?

You must come back
now, ya hear!?

Come again!

If something should
happen, I'll go too!
That's the spirit of
Yggdrasil Gear troops!

I no longer have a place
in Gear combat, but I'd
better be ready for it
anyway!

I'll go buy parts for the
Gears. General Maitreya'll
be upset if we don't try 
to put another Gear unit
together.

Hey, you haven't seen
Maria's Gear, have you?
It's too big to fit in
this hangar, so it's on
the deck.
Speaking of which...
Do you wanna change the 
name of Seibzehn?
    Yeah, why not!?
    No, not now...

General Maitreya,
Falkon and Farrant
are gone.
...I miss them.

We don't have enough
underwater equipment,
Gears, or pilots.
I'm glad you're here.

When I come here at night I
sometimes hear Maitreya and
them talking and laughing.
But when I get closer, the
voices disappear. I'm sure
they are lonely, too.

(Hyuga...
I don't know why
you are here.
But if you try
anything funny...
Do you understand?)

(I also left his land.
Since we just met, I do
not blame you for not
trusting me, but...)

Oh, young master!
It's unusual for you
to be alone.
It's already been fixed, 
so please don't worry.

This is Weltall-2.

This is Xenogears.
It is Fei's Gear.
Height 19.8 sharls
Base Weight 18.9 kahnns
Full Weight 21.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.
Weltall-2 was
transformed after its
contact with Zohar.
Detailed specs cannot be
ascertained by the
measuring devices here.
But then again, I wonder
whether this Gear has a
limited ability to measure
at all?
It almost seems that this
Gear gets stronger and
stronger as Fei's mental
powers increase...
Anyhow, the engine seems
to have been left in there
from before, so it should
require fuel as before...
But it wouldn't surprise
me if this thing doesn't
actually need fuel anymore!

This is Andvari,
the young master's Gear...
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.
This is an Omnigear that
was left by Roni Fatima,
the ancestor of our young
master...
They say this Omnigear was
created by uniting that...
Anima Relic (or whatever it
is called...) and a machine.
But by the looks of it, this
frame also used to be some
kind of Gear before it was
transformed...
All exterior work and 60% of
the interior was changed to
unknown materials, but the
base was a regular machine.
So that means the basic
performance can be improved
by using different parts.
But then again, it moves by
spiritual power so such parts
may not influence its real
overall power that much.

This is Andvari,
the young master's Gear...
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior...
They made it using the data
on the Omnigear left by Roni
Fatima, an ancestor of the
young master, and the data
obtained from Xenogears.
It is a combination of the
latest Gear technology and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.
Even when it was found
hidden in the underground
in Nisan, its basic weapon
equipment was the whip.
That must mean, the young
master's ancestors must've
used whips and rods too...
I guess it's in the blood,
huh!?

This is Heimdal,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.
Height 16.9 sharls
Base Weight 14.0 kahnns
Full Weight 18.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.
The basic frame was
excavated at the same time
as the young master's Gear.
But its output was
proportionately too powerful
for the body, so it took a
long time to adjust it...
Actually many of my team
members were injured
because of it.
But doc solved the problem
so easily, and can control
it so well now...
It was just amazing.

This is Fenrir,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.
Height 18.6 sharls
Base Weight 17.2 kahnns
Full Weight 20.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior.
They used the data from the
Omnigear, Fenril, brought
from Solalis by the Doctor,
and Fei's Xenogears.
It is a union of Gear and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.
The default equipment is
the sword...which seems
to be the doctor's weapon
of choice.

Fei
"I...must go...!!

Citan
"You are in no condition
to participate...
Let us take care of this!"

Billy
"Looks like it's time to
settle the score... But,
Fei should be resting."

Billy
"Looks like it's time to
settle the score... But,
Fei should be resting."

Citan
"Yes. 
I shall take Fei to the
infirmary.
Billy, please take care of
the rest of things."

Billy
"Please help us if you
can."

Fei!?

Fei
"Uh, doc..."

Citan
"Fei, 
feeling better already?"

Fei
"Yeah...
Probably..."

Elly
"I take my eyes off of you
for a second and this is
what you go and do...
What are you doing riding
a Gear when you're only
just recovering?"

Elly
"What are you doing riding
a Gear when you're only
just recovering?"

Billy
"Why are you up and about?
I thought you were only
just recovering?
You shouldn't be doing
that!"

Bart
"What are you moving around
for when you've only just
recovered?
Aren't sick people supposed
to rest in bed!!"

Rico
"Why are you moving around?
You've only just recovered!
Get back to bed!!"

Fei
"I don't know what I'm
doing here myself...
I don't have a clear head,
yet..."

...

Uhhh...

Citan
"Fei!!
You should not be
moving around yet!!"

Alkanshel located straight
ahead!!
Prepare Gears for launch!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1194
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bart
"...So if we destroy that
Zohar thing, everything
will be over, right?"

Citan
"Yes.
The source of our Ether
powers, and the source of
power for the generators
that make our Gears work...
It all comes from the
'Zohar Modifier' engine
which can control any
potential phenomena.
If we destroy it,
Deus...
and the -Seraph- angels...
will all be deactivated...
And then we should also be
able to free Elly, who has
become bound to the Deus
weapon system as 'Miang'."

Right, Fei?

Fei
"Yeah.
That's what the 'Wave
Existence' said."

Citan
"But then there is the
downside...
It will also mean that we
will no longer be able to
use our Gears or our Ether
powers anymore."

Rico
"What are those -Seraph-
angels all about anyway?
That odd appearance as if
they lack something...as if
they were neither living
beings nor mere weapons..."

Citan
"Zohar senses the human
consciousness and
incarnates the -Seraphs-."

Billy
"Human consciousness...?"

Citan
"Zohar itself involves the
principle of uncertainty.
The observer's perception
of Zohar determines the
entity it actually becomes.
In other words, I believe
that those angels are
incarnations of the
spirits of people...
...The people who have
been absorbed by Deus to
become parts of it."

Bart
"So what merit is there for
them to gain in eliminating
all of civilization?"

Maria
"Is it some kind of hatred
for those humans who have
survived?"

Citan
"Of course not.
Those people who were
created and assimilated
as parts for Deus would
not have such intentions.
Try to remember what
Elly, when she became
Miang, said."

Fei
" 'The creations of god
   will someday be a
   hindrance...
   That is why they must
   be eliminated...'"

Citan
"Yes. That is why Merkava
is being used to begin the
destruction.
But...Deus is not
following its programming
of exterminating all of
civilization...
The -Seraphs-, which are
terminal interface weapons
of Deus, are using their
bodies composed of...
...nanomachines to absorb
massive numbers of people
regardless of whether
they are dead or alive.
It is not discriminating
between the mutant and 
non-mutant people. This
is highly peculiar...
...The fact that the
people who are meant to
be destroyed are being
taken in as well...
That is the absolute
opposite of what it is
supposed to be doing."

Fei
"Maybe there aren't
enough parts?"

Citan
"That is unlikely.
Aside from those bodies
that were destined to be
parts for it...
...Deus, who has already
acquired the abilities of
the nanomachines, can just
about use any material...
...to construct its body.
It is obvious, it has other
intentions in mind."

Citan
"Those intentions...
Krelian has called Deus
the mother.
If god is the mother, then
those motives are coming
from the Great Mother...
Impeding the growth of its
child, enveloping it, to
bring the child back to the
womb to become one with it.
That is its motive. Such a
program does not exist
within its design though.
It was probably given this
unique will by someone.
Either from Elly who has
merged with the Deus or..."

Fei
"Either way, it doesn't
change the fact that we
have to fight.
Regardless of what their
intentions are.
The problem is how we're
supposed to deal with them.
You think we can do it
in our current state?"

Zephyr
"This secret battleship,
Excalibur, will also take
part in the final battle.
Additionally, the military
potential of all the
surface forces will
assemble here."

Bart
"Even if we can put
together a massive force...
...we still have the
problem with the main
armament of the Merkava.
We need to know how to take
that out. As long as we
don't do that..."

Citan
"Merkava's ultra-long-range
cannon has the ability to
vaporize any substance.
On top of that, they have a
barrier around their
perimeter that nullifies
all attacks."

Zephyr
"We've fought against the
Merkava many times to try
to stop its onslaught.
However, we cannot even
get close. Hence we have
had to withdraw everytime."

Fei
"Dammit!
No matter how much we
want to save Elly...
...if we can't get
inside the Merkava,
it's meaningless."

Sigurd
"To add to that, there
is the problem of those
-Seraphs-.
...They function as the
terminal interfaces weapons
for close defense.
I can easily say that their
attack power is equivalent
to the Omnigear class."

Bart
"They even have the
regenerative ability due
to the nanomachines."

Taura
"Don't be concerned
about that."

Taura
"I was able to obtain some
data from Xenogears...
You see, Xenogears has
mutagenically evolved due
to its contact with Zohar.
Using that data, all of
your new Gears ought to
be completed soon.
Additionally, all the other
weapons and armaments are
being modified to implement
the 'Disassembler-Device'."

Billy
"Disassembler-Device?"

Taura
"In contrast to the Nano-
assemblers, which create
matter to repair with...
...the Disassembers have
the ability to dismantle
or destroy matter.
They can even deactivate
the nanomachines' restoring
ability by disengaging
their repair programs.
This should be sufficiently
effective even against the
Deus' -Seraphs-."

Fei
"Alright, even if we can
deal with the angels...
...just how are we gonna
deal with that Merkava?
We can't even get close
to the thing..."

Citan
"There is no such thing
as a perfect defense.
There is a way."

Citan
"Look over here."

Merkava's main gun requires
a 1.2 second interval to
reload because of its
tremendous output.
Upon firing, although it
is only sectional, there
will be a portion of the
barrier that will be opened.
There is a 1.87 second
delay before the barrier
reforms in that area. If
we can use this window of
time to target and destroy
that cannon, it will be
possible to close in on it.
If we can get close enough,
we can break through with
gravitational-spatial
correction.

Citan
"Well, this is the
rough idea."

Sigurd
"Unfortunately we don't
have such a long range
cannon...
...that could acquire
a target in such
a brief time frame."

Bart
"So what you're sayin' is
we just need to shut that
annoying cannon up, right?"

Fei
"...You want to
go head on into
Merkava!?"

Billy
"Now you're being reckless
again... That's suicide."

Bart
"No, listen. We're not
going to just rush in.
The Yggdrasil IV and
this Excalibur are also
equipped with barriers.
That's what we'll use.
Although only for a short
time, we can withstand a
direct hit from Merkava's
main cannon.
Then we can close in and
watch for that part of the
barrier to go down and
then destroy the cannon."

Fei
"How long will our
barrier last?"

Bart
"About 20 or so seconds."

Fei
"That's all? It wouldn't
matter how fast we fly.
In that amount of time,
we'll be without a barrier
before we can get within
firing range.
And those numbers are valid
only if the generator is at
full drive, right?
You can only get those
numbers if we sacrifice
all other output and
propulsion."

Bart
"I'm not suggesting we go
in with guns blazing
knowing we're gonna lose.
We're going to physically
put a lid on it,
directly!!"

 ? 

Bart
"As you've said...
The Yggdrasil IV or
Excaliber's barrier can't
sufficiently defend against
Merkava's attack.
At least with one
generator that is..."

Billy
"Meaning...?"

Bart
"Meaning, we can defend
against the Merkava with
twice the amount of time...
...40 seconds, if we couple
the 2 generators together.
This way, we can make it
into the heart of Merkava."

Maison
"Then, what about the
propulsion..."

Bart
"Just hear me out."

This is what we do...
First we transform my Yggdrasil
into heavy assault mode and
load it onto the Excalibur so
we can couple the generators.

By doing that, we can
reduce the energy usage
down to just supporting
the hull of the ship and
generating the barrier.
This will allow most of
the energy to be devoted
to generating the barrier.
Next, shift the barrier to
full front and focus it to
a single point where their
main cannon will make its
strike.

Now for movement.
First off, we develop
a barrier by engaging
Excalibur's generator
to maximum power.
For propulsion during that
time, we'll install on the
Yggdrasil those large solid
rockets we got from the
ruins of the Mass-driver.

When Excalibur's barrier
expires, we'll use the
Yggdrasil IV's generator
to develop a barrier.
Then we'll also detach
the solid rockets and
shift the Excalibur into
conventional flight.

Using this method, we can
get right in Merkava's
face. After it fires,
it'll be defenseless.
During this time, we'll
block the muzzle of
Merkava's cannon with
Excalibur's bow ram.
Upon which, we should
have 0.67 seconds...

With the cannon fire of the
Excalibur, we'll destroy the
Yggdrasil IV's slave
generator and incapacitate
the Merkava along the way,
and then...we breakthrough!

Bart
"...That's what the plan
is all about.
The combination of the
barriers of both ships...
Storming the Merkava...
The timing of the cannon
fire of the Excalibur...
These are all going to
be crucial.
Mess up any one of these
and the consequences are
going to be severe.
Hence, it'll be necessary
to have both crews in
synch with each other.
That's why I'd like to
place Sig in command of
the Excalibur."

Sigurd
"I have no qualms
with that..."

Bart
"What do you think, Queen?
Will you lend us your
battleship?"

Zephyr
"Since there appears to
be no other alternative,
let us go with that.
Please use it as you
see fit."

Citan
"But are we not cutting it
uncomfortably close...?
...When you calculate the
arrival time and the
barrier generation time,
you will see what I mean!
One minor mishap will put
us in a situation where we
could run out of barrier
power before our arrival."

Sigurd
"Also, we will be devoting
both generators to keeping
the barriers up...
Won't that leave us
without perimeter
defenses?
We won't stand a chance
if we get engaged by the
-Seraph- angels on our
way to Merkava."

Fei
"We'll hold them off.
You can count on us!
You guys just concentrate
on taking out that main
cannon."

Bart
"Thanks.
We're depending on you."

Fei
"Already, everywhere
else has been taken out.
This is the only place
that's left. This is
going to be the true
'final battle'."

Yggdrasil Engine Room - 1196
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's enough work just
to change those fuses
here and there...

More than a specified
output isn't supposed
to be generated.

Aww man! The levitron's
coil is also burnt...

The coil'll break if the
toroid is cooled down
suddenly... It's big,
but it's delicate...

The electric circuit
is optimized and...

The levitron's not in
a good mood today.
The plasma cools down
too quickly...

Is the fuse alright?

It's almost time...
We may not be able to do
much on the front line,
but we'll give you the
best support we can!

There's a new gadget
in the aft...!
I'm lucky to be able
to work on something
that awesome at my
age... Hehehe.

Don't worry.
It's going great!

You're going to
some ghost ship?
Be careful, now!

Elly
"Chief...
I'm very sorry.
I..."

That's alright.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I don't find it a problem
with young people making
mistakes!

(But, if you do it again,
you're gonna be in deep...!)

I've been working on
these engines for many
long years...
But I can't figure out
why high energy plasma
is produced in the
Slave Generators...
Actually nobody knows the
generators' mechanism of
either ships or Gears.
But perhaps that Solaris
may know what Slave
Generators really are...

Good, good!! It's better
than before, since we can
now use water for cooling.
But because of that,
there's more labor needed.

Young master...doesn't
this place remind you of
the day of that accident?

Well the Yggdrasil sank...
But fortunately we were
able to find this one...
But whenever I work on
this engine I get this
mysterious feeling...
Like this ship is somehow
'related' to the previous
one... Strange, huh!?

You failed...
Well, everyone has their
ups and downs in life.

Young master, forget about
the past... What's more
important is the future.
Today's battle isn't over
yet.

A mechanic's greatest
moment is the night
before a mission!
Tomorrow is that once
in a life time day when
this ship can show what
it's really made of...
I'm gonna make you
beautiful, old girl!

Marguerite has returned
and it sounds like it's
time to settle the score.
Engine! I'm counting on
you! When it's over, you
and I can have plenty of
rest... Good rest...

Good job!
We saved Marguerite!
I hear some guy called
Fei, a martial artist,
helped us out there.

Y, you, quit loafing
around here and go
concentrate on training
like that guy Fei!!

Here we go!
This time you're going
to save Marguerite!
I gave you enough fuel
...so let's go get her!

Phew, finally I can let
her rest. Take plenty of
rest while you still can!

Whoa whoa!!
That was close!

Engine Full Power!

Guys from Shevat installed
tons of stuff for me...
so it's much more fun to
work on!

See you later!

...
You're alright, aren't you?
You're the normal Elly, right?

Awh shoot!!
I must restore it again
because of that girl!!

Phew...
It's somehow moving alright.
Now, I've got to restore it.

Young master...do you
think the sunken Yggdrasil
is resting in peace now?

I wonder if the engine of
our old sunken Yggdrasil is
weeping in the deep sand...

No, she's resting there.
We ought to believe it
must be the best place
for her, otherwise...

This Yggdrasil is still here.
As long as it's in good shape,
we can do many more rematches!

That old man is all
fired up with zeal...
I sure hope his blood
vessels don't burst...

No need to worry!
His blood vessels are
made of duralumin and
oil flows inside them.

Finally, the engine 
can take a rest.

When we get to Nisan, we can
give the engine a rest again.
See the big donut-shape
running along the six poles
standing underneath here?
The plasma generated inside
there is the power source
for the ship.
The same goes for the Gears.

The old man's in
a good old mood!!

You shouldn't go up
there. Trust me.

He's always like that.
Don't take it personally.
He's not a bad person.

The chief has a weakness
for young women.

W, what! It's expected for
a man to be kind to women, 
isn't it!?

(Grrr!!
But you're cold to
your own wife!!)

Engine Full Power!

I asked the guys from Shevat
about it... But it sounds
like they don't even know.
They told me nobody knows how
their country flies anymore.

A machine that's kept moving
since ancient times, without
any maintenance, eh...
I must uncover the secret of
its mechanism.

Be careful!

!!
Please don't break
it this time.

How could he figure out
this complicated device
so easily...?
Generally, more than a
specified output can't
be produced.
What kind of hypnosis
was he under?

The Thames sounds like
a fun place to visit.
I'm gonna sneak out...

What the hell are you
sneaking out for!? Wait
till you're independent!

Man, he heard me!

Work, work!

She'll carry on the
will and mission of its
sister ship, proudly!!

Sorry, but I really don't
want to talk about it.
Please leave me alone...

Oh, young master, you're
alright! What's your plan
from now on?

Shoot! I found a bug
at a time like this!
What should I do...
I wonder if I'll be
able to fix it by
tomorrow...

It's falling apart...

We're almost at Nisan!!
Come on, engine!

Engine's doing fantastic!!

You shouldn't go up there.
Trust me!

He yelled at you, didn't he?
He gets mad at us, too.
He only opens his heart to
his dog, Martle.

Rico
"If you're looking for
Citan, he was at the
Gear Shop..."

Chu-Chu
"I'm exhauschued chu!
Since you're here...
I'd like a massage!!
Just kidding..."

Chu-Chu
"Elly, she was so kind...
I know I'm not the only
one chu miss her.
I know Bart, Margie,
Billy, Citan, Rico,
Maria, Emeralda, and
Fei all do chu...
Although they don't say
it, I can feel it...
Standing here, I remember
her kind and gentle smile.
Elly will return, won't
she?"

Fei
"...
Thanks, Chu-Chu...
Thanks for trying to
reduce all this tension
in the air for me.
I'll remember this...
Anyway...
Elly's gotta be alive!
Right?"

Chu-Chu
"Fei..."

Fei
"Let's go back to the room.
Margie seemed worried."

Chu-Chu
"Okay.
I'll come chu!"

What do you want to do?
    View Gear from here
    View Gear from front
    Hear lowdown on Gear
    Nothing

This is Stier.
It's the Battling Champ,
Rico's Gear.
Height 19 sharls
Base Weight 20.8 kahnns
Full Weight 27.5 kahnns
Although it appears slow,
it's actually quite nimble
with the Grind-rollers.
Since it's built for
Battling, it's got the
best endurance.
The Drillclaw on the left
arm has the ability to tear
through steel plates of up
to 0.8 sharls.

This is Stier-2.
It is Rico's Gear.
Height 19.2 sharls
Base Weight 22.2 kahnns
Full Weight 26.7 kahnns
Like the other Omnigears,
it was at one point an Anima
Relic absorbed by Deus and
deactivated...
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar
and Mechior, reconstructed it.
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.
Its standard weapon is the
same as it was before its
reconstruction.

This is Vierge.
It's the Gear for that
girl from Solaris.
Height 15.7 sharls
Base Weight 10.2 kahnns
Full Weight 14.7 kahnns
The frame along with the
armor have been minimized
for reduced weight.
But within all that lies
the impressive technology
of Solaris.
It's a lot more resistant
to damage than what its
appearance suggests.
Rather than physical
damage, it's more
specialized for Ether
attacks.
This is especially so with
the tail stabilizers and
equipped side skirts which
are used...
...for the explosively
damaging Ether guidance
weapons, 'Aerods'.
It basically reflects
that young lady's Ether
power directly.

Renmazuo
It is Billy's Gear.
Height 15.9 sharls
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns
It's still under
investigation so I
don't know the details.

Renmazuo
This is Billy's Gear.
Height 15.9 sharl
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns
Although on the outside
it looks like an 'Ethos'
-type Gear, inside, it
is entirely Solaris-type.
Since it's for Etone use,
that Stone character most
likely brought it here
directly after its
creation in Solaris.
But, because of that,
its capabilities are
really impressive.
Especially those anti-Wels
Revolver Cannons equipped
in both arms.
They are very destructive.
An average Gear would be
junk after taking one hit.

Renmazuo2
This is Billy's Gear.
Height 18.8 sharl
Base Weight 14.9 kahnns
Full Weight 19.3 kahnns
Like the other Omnigears it
was at one point an Anima
Relic that was absorbed by
Deus and thus deactivated.
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar and
Mechior could reconstruct it.
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.
The standard weapon is the
same as before reconstruction.
Billy's father's Buntline
Cannon can still be used too.

Crescens
It's Emeralda's Gear.
Height 15.4 sharl
Base Weight 9.7 kahnns
Full Weight 13.3 kahnns
This Gear's controls are
quite unique.
The colony of nanomachines
from Emeralda's body
physically merges with the
Gear for direct control.
Theoretically, this Gear
shouldn't require repairs
but it seems they don't try
to repair anything except
Emeralda herself.
So, we're left with no
other choice but to have
to maintain the Gear.
The surface hovering and
flight capabilties are
quite impressive.

This is...
huh, Chu-Chu!?
What in the world
are you doing here!
You don't need any
maintenance work!!
You're in the way!
Go eat some food
and take a nap or
sumthin'!

Change this Gear's name?
    Yes
    Not now

Hmm, Chu-Chu isn't
exactly an object.
There's nothing I can
do for you there.

Bart
"Y, you know..."

Bart
"Hey?"

...

Bart
"Quit the silent treatment!
I came here to apologize!"

Rico
"...
What's your problem!?
I thought I dealt with
you a while ago.
I'm not the type to
dwell on the past."

...

Rico
"I'm more concerned about
those two Gears there...
Who the hell are you?
I'm amazed you tune them
to run so well!
I thought Fei and I were
the only ones who could
work Gears that well..."

Bart
"Wow you really are the
Battling Champ... Oops,
I mean ex-Champ...
I'm amazed how you can
tell how good a Gear is
just by looking at it."

Rico
"I guess you can't learn
all about the world inside
a dark prison.
Really interesting.
I was gonna move on but
now I've changed my mind...
Let me join you, boss."

Bart
"I guess it's alright..."

I thought it was about
time for you to come...

Elly
"It's no use trying
to stop me.
Even if it is you,
if you get in my way,
I have no choice but
to...!!"

Citan
"That is no way for a lady
to speak. I just came here
to see you off."

?

Citan
"I refueled Weltall.
We are ready to go
anytime."

Elly
"...Citan."

Citan
"...But, Elly, you cannot
use your Gear while it is
under repairs."

Elly
"What? Then what am I...?"

Citan
"You know that Omnigear...
What if you borrow it..."

Fei
"No way. I can't take
Shevat's property
without permission..."

Citan
"Elly is the only
appropriate person
for the Gear.
Nobody else can
operate it."

No...

Elly
"Never!!
I won't ride it, ever!!"

Fei
"Elly...?
What's wrong?"

Elly
"I'm so scared...
That's why... I'll
never want to do it!!"

Citan
"This is a problem..."

How about if I
ride with you?

Fei
"Everyone...?"

Bart
"Sorry...Fei."

Billy
"I'm sorry..."

Margie
"Sorry..."

Fei
"No...
Thanks, everyone."

Citan
"Now, I know you hate to
leave, but we should get
going before dawn.
I did some work on the
radar, so it
should work fine!"

Citan
"...They have left..."

Emeralda
"Fei...where..."

Citan
"They went far away."

Emeralda
"I...go..."

Ouch...

Bart
"I guess the Bart Missiles
weren't such a good idea,
huh...
We were able to save you
and your friends, Citan...
But I wonder what happened
to Fei and Elly..."

Bart
"I'm sure...they're alive
somewhere...
And, once again..."

Bart
"Man!
The sea breeze stings my
eye... So this is what
they call the sea..."

Bart
"First of all, I have to
apologize to those two."

Billy
"Dad..."

Citan
"Billy...
I should not have
made such a thing..."

Citan
"Billy...
I should not have
made such a thing..."

Billy
"No, it's not
your fault..."

Billy
"This's the best way
to see father off."

You're right...
Thanks, son.

Billy
"D, dad!"

Citan
"Old friend!
Are you alright?"

Citan
"Old friend!
Are you alright?"

Jessie
"You'd better believe it!
I ain't gonna leave that
stupid junk alone!
I improved it!"

Jessie
"Ouchy-wow-wow!!
But I never wanna do
that again though..."

Citan
"But still...
talking about hell...
I am surprised to know
an irreligious person
like you would believe
in life after death..."

Citan
"But still...
talking about hell...
I am surprised to know
an irreligious person
like you would believe
in life after death..."

Jessie
"Oh?
So you were listening?
That was a curse.
Isn't that a fitting
end for him?"

Citan
"It is definitely
your style."

Citan
"It is definitely
your style."

Primera
"Pa...pa..."

Huh, Prim?"

Primera
"Pa...pa..."

Jessie
"Ha, ha, did you hear that?
Primera's problem seems to
have been solved!"

Billy
"Hah...!
Prim talked!
Prim just talked!
Hey, Prim...
Now say my name.
Say 'Billy'!"

He did nothing wrong!"

Rico
"I'm the one who's going
to beat Fei! So I can't
let him die like this!"

Rico
"Do what you need to do.
It's none of my business."

That's good to hear!"

Are you serious?
Who's the enemy that
could beat the

Hammer
"S, s, sorry!!
Pleeze forgive me...!!"

Hammer
"Where is this place?
Never heard of the
'Thames' before."

Hammer
"So you're Bart, the
'pirate', huh...
Hammer, the 'supplier',
has great information for
you... Shakhan still
controls Aveh...
He's planning military
intervention in Nisan.
But for some reason,
Gebler is stopping him...
...Oh, so you already
knew that?"

Hammer
"I'm staying put here."

Hammer
"Where are we?"

Hammer,
Rico...
Wake up!

Rico
"What is this place?
Something smells."

Citan
"We are inside the ship
of Bart and his crew.
They rescued us after
we were shot down in
the Goliath."

Rico
"Who the heck are
'Bart and his crew'?"

Citan
"Let us say...they are
bandits...robbing Aveh.
Bart is their leader,
though he is still a
young man."

Rico
"A robber in this day
and age? A man with an
attitude. I like it!!"

Citan
"...
Do you want to start off
by going to meet Bart?"

Rico
"Hmm...
You read my mind!"

Hammer
"I'm staying here!"

Yggdrasil Medical Bay - 1204

Argh... If only I wasn't
wounded, I'd also be able
to...!

Oh yeaahh!
We're going to give it all
we've got for the young
master!!

Whoa!

You may have realized it,
but I was only pretending
to be sick...
When I saw Chu-Chu trying
so hard it made me feel
ashamed. From now on,
I'll be more courageous!

If I didn't have this
wound...

Ghost ship expedition?
If I didn't have this
wound I'd...

Fei seems to be alright,
eh. If I didn't have
this wound...

Fei looks terrible...
If I didn't have
this wound I'd...

Elly,
why did...?

There was something
wrong with Elly.

It looks like a fun place
to be. If I only
didn't have this wound...

Oh, young master!
I'm not trying to hide.
If only I didn't have this
wound...

You are the ex-Battling
Champ? If I didn't have
this wound even I...

If the young master became
the king tomorrow...what
would happen to us? I'm
tired of being a soldier.
I wanna start a business 
or something... If I
didn't have this wound..."

Nisan, eh...
It's been so long.
If I didn't have this
wound I'd...

You won at the martial
arts tournament?  
Well done! If I didn't
have this wound...

You did great. If only 
I didn't have this
wound...

Fight to your heart's
content and go get injured
to your heart's content!

...What?  Later.
...I'm afraid of heights.

Listen, you've only been
checking your weight.
Do you want me to examine
inside for a change?
Early detection, early
prevention is important,
you know.

Ghosts don't get injured.
That's no fun, is it?

Fei... You're alright,
aren't you?
Oh, I'm so happy! It's
wonderful to be a nurse!

Fei...
Is he alright?

Elly...
Is she alright?

Elly was lying down 
till a minute ago...

Now that you mention it,
I wonder where she went.

Why? Why? Why is everyone
going to see the doctor on
the Thames while a pretty,
talented doctor like myself
is here?
Maybe I should operate on
fish instead.
Sob...

When you get hurt, don't
soak yourself in sea
water! Come here right
away.

Oh, young master!
Could you increase the
medical fees, please!?

Interesting customer!
You're an ex-Battling
Champ, right?
So, you always have
fresh wounds, don't
you? Uh hmm...

Finally, tomorrow is
the day for the blood
blowing, um, flesh
falling...
No, I mean, the blood-
boiling, flesh-dancing
battle to recapture the
capital, right?

Yeah!! I can finally get
supplies in Nisan. I made
so many mistakes that I
ran out of needles...

I hear you won at the
martial arts tournament.
That's great!
By the way...
did you get hurt?
Oh, you didn't?
Too bad...
I mean... that's good.

You did a great job!?
By the way...
did you get hurt?
Oh, you didn't?
Too bad...
I mean...that's good.
But if you do get injured,
let me know right away.
I'll heal you!

Citan
"We can use this machine
for now, but it is just
for temporary use."

Citan
"She was able to
get up just now."

Elly
"I'm a little worried
about Fei...but I'll
help you anytime!"

Elly
"I, I...
How in the world
did I get here?"

Fei
"Elly..."

Yes!

Uh, no...

Sigurd
"Young master, the radar
has picked up a huge Gear!
It's headed right for us!"

Bart
"What!?
Them again!?"

Sigurd
"That shape looks like...!"

Bart
"Alright! I owe so much to
the Thames. I can't let it
turn into a battle field.
Launch the Yggdrasil
immediately!
We'll go out in our
Gears!"

Yes, sir!!

Bart
"Fei, Citan,
I'm counting on you!"

Wait!!

Citan
"Elly should rest here.
We will..."

Elly
"Wait!!
Because I came here this
all happened...
This is my responsibility!
So...
So let me go too!"

Elly...?

Bart
"What the hell are
you talking about!
Don't you remember
what you just did...!?"

Young one!

Citan
"Elly, our trust in you
depends on this battle.
For your honor, you
should fight!"

Bart
"But Citan!
I...!"

Citan
"Young one,
please trust
Elly this time."

Citan
"Elly, if you try anything
suspicious, I will be the
one to shoot you.
Is that clear?"

Yes.

Citan
"Is that okay with you,
young one?"

Bart
"...
Alright. Fei, Elly,
let's go!!"

Yeah!!

...

Elly
"Fei, I'm sorry..."

Citan
"Kahr...
Please listen to me!
Right now, we must forget
about being friend or foe.
We all must support one
another, regardless...
Right now,
we need your help!"

Ramsus
"...
I...am...just trash...
...a...reject..."

Citan
"Stop feeling sorry
for yourself and pull
yourself together man!!"

Sigurd
"Hyuga!?
What are you..."

Citan
"Trash...
Reject...
You can take pity and call
yourself that all you want,
but what about them!?"

Citan
"Are these women stupid,
or trash, or rejects too
for believing in you?
The reasons why you helped
the girls, who had no one
to turn to, may not have
been that noble...
But in spite of that,
they stuck with you.
Do you know why?"

They know you better than
anybody else. They know
the true kindness that
exists inside your heart.
They know because they
want to be loved.
That is why they won't
leave you.
Kahr...
Do not make them into the
trash or rejects that you
speak of.

Dominia
"Commander..."

Ramsus
"All of you..."

Citan
"Needless to say, 
you are not trash
or a reject...
We know that better
than anyone does."

Ramsus
"I...I didn't realize that
what I've been looking for
...was so close to me...
I'm...sorry...
for not realizing sooner!"

"Oh, Commander...!!"

"My Seibzehn is too
big, so I'm having it
kept on the deck.
If you need Seibzehn
he'll be ready for
take-off anytime!

Emeralda
"Emeralda...
go too..."

Fei
"Ah...sorry about what just
happened... Forgive me...
But, I want to explain...
Now for the first time,
people, on both earth and
Solaris, are becoming one.
But then, not all of them
are strong like the crew
of this ship, or the
people in Shevat.
Even we almost lose sight
of our future at times...
so you can imagine what
regular people go through.
That's why people need
someone like you to
depend on...
As a light to guide us.
You freed the hearts of the
people that have been used
as tools by that Ministry
for hundreds of years.
Elly, it was you!
And now your body doesn't
just belong to you alone
anymore.
That's why I can't let you
be in any danger.
And that's why I don't want
you to fight anymore."

...It's funny, isn't it?

Huh?

Elly
"We used to be enemies,
but now we're together
like this..."

Elly
"In the beginning...
I think I saw myself
in you.
We seemed to overlap...
You being in a similar
situation as I was in.
When I was with you,
I didn't feel alone or
apprehensive. That's why
I thought I liked you...
But, it wasn't that.
I simply didn't have
the courage to look at
my true self.
I turned to you to run
away from it all...
I mistook that for love."

Elly
"But, it's different now.
I can face my own problems.
I am me...and you are you.
It has all become clear
to me now.
I also learned that I
really do need you...
It's not because I need
you as a sanctuary for
my problems. I need you
because I truly love you."

Elly...

Elly
"I know what you're saying,
Fei. I know why you're so
concerned for my safety...
But you know, I'm...scared.
I fear we may never see
each other again...
I just have this feeling."

Fei
"Don't worry,
I won't die."

Elly
"No, it's not that...
It's something completely
different...
It's as if I'm being torn
apart by something I can't
resist...
That I'm no longer me...
Even if you come back
safely... It still...
It just feels so uneasy...
That is why I need to go
with you.
I can't bear to be away
from you."

Fei
"I feel the same way...
Ever since the time I met
you in that forest...
I think it's the same
feeling that you've been
having...
I was also running to you.
But I have to solve my own
problems.
I can't throw my problems
onto you."

Fei
"There is another me...
'Id' is within me.
I fear that at any moment
Id may awaken within me.
You're the only one that
has been able to keep me
from giving in to Id.
It was because you were
always by my side that I
was still able to keep
from losing myself."

Fei
"I promise you that
I will return.
So...that is...Elly,
I want you to be my reason
to return... To be my home
that I can return to...
Elly, if you will wait for
me to come back...
even if we are in totally
different places...
As long as you will stay
by my side...
I know I'll be able
to do anything..."

Oh, Fei...

Are you going now?

Fei
"Yeah, sorry.
Did I wake you?"

Elly
"It's okay.
I've been awake
all along..."

All along?

Elly
"Uh-huh.
I was watching over
you while you slept...
And before I realized
it, it was morning..."

...

Fei
"W, well, I'm off."

Elly
"Alright then...
Do be careful..."

Fei
"Yeah, I will...
Oh! Could you hold
on to this for me?"

Elly
"What is this?
Is this a...pendant?"

Fei
"I don't know whose it is.
It seems it was on me when
I was brought into Lahan.
It may be mine, or it
could be..."

It could be...?

Fei
"Oh, nothing...
Will you just hold
on to it for me?"

Elly
"Alright.
I'll hold on
to it for you."

Fei
"Thanks.
...Well,
I guess it's goodbye!"

Oh... Fei.

Yeah?

Elly
"Thank you..."

Bart
"Hey, Margie!
Get rid of that strange
stuffed animal sitting
in front of the bridge.
It's in our way."

Margie
"It's not a 'strange
stuffed animal'!
It has a name.
Its name is..."

Margie
"Her name is Chu-Chu!"

Margie
"But, that's weird.
It was just here, where I
put it, a moment ago..."

Nice chu meet chu!!
I'm Chu-Chu!
I fell in love with you
when I first saw you in
Bledavik!! Wherever you
go, I shall go chu!

Bart
"What we thought was just
a stuffed toy is actually
a living animal! Weird!"

Margie
"No wonder it felt
strangely lukewarm!"

Fei
"Wha, What!?"

Bart
"Looking good, Fei!!"

Fei
"Shut up!!"

Bart
"It's all right.
I, as the captain, give
you my permission!"

Chu-Chu
"Yeah, yeah!"

Fei
"...
Suit yourself!"

Bart
"Ha, ha, ha!
Well, I don't want
to interrupt you two,
so I'll wait outside!"

Margie
"..."

Margie
"Thank you for your help
at the castle.
I heard you really riled
it up at the tournament.
Bart was bragging how
you're both buddies and
all."

Fei
"...
Re...really?"

Margie
"I'm so ashamed...
I want to be of help
to Bart but I ended
up owing him again."

Margie
"Fei, have you seen Bart's
back?
He's got scars all over
his back and it looks so
painful.
Long ago, when the two of
us got caught by Shakhan,
Bart protected me from
getting beaten..."

Margie
"At that time, I decided
to be his follower...to
serve and protect him!
But, he is the one who's
always protecting me..."

Fei
"..."

Margie
"Uh, oh, so sorry...
Anyway, thanks a lot
for saving me!"

Margie
"You're the only ones
who can save us...
We're counting on you!"

Margie
"Young master...
You better not die!
Promise me!!"

Bart
"Of course! I'm not going
to die! Quit sayin'
such weird stuff!"

Margie
"Sorry...
Yeah...you're right...
You'll make it back...
When you come back, I'm
going to...well...
I just thought...
...maybe I could be...
closer to you...you know..."

Bart
"Hey, whoa! Quit it.
Do you know what
you're saying!?"

Margie
"Heh, just kiddin'!!
Young master, you're
all panicked!!"

...

Margie
"Funny...
I don't see Chu-Chu
anywhere!
Where'd she go off to?"

Margie
"Everyone...
I'm really worried..."

Margie
"I feel kinda out of it!
But the important stuff is
about to begin, right!?"

Margie
"I should be able to help
Bart this time!"

Margie
"We may not see each other
for a while."

Margie
"Fei?
No, he hasn't come here!"

Margie
"...I knew something was
up with the 'Ethos'...
It's not permissible to use
religion for wrong doing!"

Margie
"Wels...
Kinda scary."

Margie
"Ghost ship, eh?
It reminds me of the days
Bart and I used to dare
each other..."

Bart
"Ma...Margie,
stop talking about that!"

Margie
"Heh, heh, heh!
If you insist..."

Margie
"What a relief!"

Margie
"I'm glad we've met up
with such nice people.
Anyway, I'd better hurry
and get back to my church!"

Margie
"Fei, go to Elly.
You should be there for
her in times like this."

Chu-Chu
"Don't chu want Chu-Chu
to go with you chu?"

Margie
"You stay here!"

Margie
"I was the only one who
escaped Shakhan's grip by
fleeing Nisan with Bart...
I wonder if the sisters
are all right...
The young master will help
them too, won't he?"

Margie
"Even though it was the
sect's wish, it still left
a bitter feeling..."

Margie
"Thanks, Fei!!"

Margie
"How dare you come into
a girl's room without
knocking!"

Margie
"I'm not good enough to
fight with Bart and his
comrades...
But I can be a manager!
Let me know when you want
to change party members!"

Margie
"Change party members?"
    Yes
    No

Margie
"Oops, sorry!
You can't change now!"

Margie
"Let me know again!"

Chu-Chu
"I...may have been
getting in everyone's
way up chu now.
But, I can't stand chu
think Fei and all his
friends may perish away
like us...
I'm going chu fight so
that this kind of thing
never happens chu
anyone again!!"

Chu-Chu
"I am ready chu
fight anytime!"

Chu-Chu
"...I admire Primera.
She's only a child yet she
has been through so muchu.
But then you look at me...
I'd better start chu get
my act chugether!"

Chu-Chu
"Stone was a baddie!?
I'll never be able
chu forgive him!"

Chu-Chu
"The boat suddenly started
chu roll, and now I don't
feel chu good!!"

Chu-Chu
"It's fun chu see more
and more people here!!"

Chu-Chu
"Chu-Chu can't do muchu
anything either, so I'll
just be a dependent chu!"

Chu-Chu
"Fei, still sleeping?
A maiden's kiss might
wake him up.
Oh, what am I saying!?
This is chu embarrassing!!"

Chu-Chu
"Fei, still sleeping?
A maiden's kiss might
wake you up.
Oh, what am I saying!?
This is chu embarrassing!!"

Chu-Chu
"Fei is sleeping now chu?
He is suchu a sleepyhead."

Chu-Chu
"If I break something,
Fei will comfort me, right?
So what should I break?"

Chu-Chu
"This place isn't
chu familiar.
But it doesn't matter
because I didn't know
muchu about Aveh in
the first place chu."

Chu-Chu
"It's chu noisy. Is it
some kind of festival?"

Chu-Chu
"Nobody's here, and
there's nothing chu do!
I'm so bored!"

Chu-Chu
"Wow! A delicious
looking spider..."

Munchu munchu

Chu-Chu
"Presents are a way
chu a woman's heart!
Here's your reward!"

Received 'Ether Veiler'!

Chu-Chu
"My eyes dry out when
pretending chu be a
stuffed animal. Ouchu!"

Oh my...
I just declared
my love!!

Primera
"..."

Primera
"..."

Billy
"Prim!
Why are you here!?
Stay at the orphanage..."

Primera
"..."

Billy
"Prim...won't you listen
to your brother?"

Margie
"Billy, Primera followed
you here because she's
worried about you.
Can't you see!?
Let her stay a little
while, okay?"

"..."

Billy
"...Well then...
Don't you go anywhere,
okay?"

Primera
"..."

Billy
"Margie, please take care
of my little sister."

Chu-Chu
"Why don't chu
ask me that chu?"

She's holding a note...
Read it?
    Read it
    No, better not!

'PriMemo'
Big brother,
hang in there...

'PriMemo'
There are three types of
guns that are standard
equipment for you...
 Handgun,
 Ether-gun,
 Big-gun.
The only gun that can be
re-equipped is the handgun.
You can power-up guns by
upgrading their respective
'ammo' or 'bullets'.
Equipping ammo is done by
pressing the Left or Right
Directional button at the
equipment menu screen.
Doing this will switch the
equipment window to a sub-
window where you can change
the type of ammo you use.
There is one thing you have
to be careful of... There
is a only a finite amount
of each type of ammo!
Hence, it is important to
keep an ample supply of
ammo in reserve and reload
as often as possible.
The only exception to this
is the Ether gun, which can
be shot an unlimited amount
of times.

It's lukewarm...

Bart
"That Margie...!
Leaving a strange stuffed
animal in a place like
this! Because of this, we
can't get into the bridge."

It's not strange!

Bart
"Hey, Fei!!
Stop the funny
voices, will ya!?"

Fei
"Huh? 
I didn't say anything."

Bart
"...
That's weird...
Anyway, let's ask
Margie to get rid
of it."

Get on the transport ship?
    Yes
    Wait a minute

Preparing for launch.
Do not open hatch!
              -Sigurd

Do not open hatch
while in motion.
          -Sigurd

Elly
"They can't launch the
Yggdrasil cause Sigurd
isn't there...
He must be in the Gun
Room or somewhere."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1212
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"Wait a minute!
You want me to stay here?
No, I'm going with you!"

Fei
"No.
It's too dangerous..."

Elly
"Why? I've been in many
dangerous situations.
This isn't the first time!"

Fei
"I said NO!
We can't take you.
Please, understand!"

Elly
"No, I want to go!"

Elly
"We've been fighting
together all this time!
And suddenly you're
telling me not to go!?
I just don't get it!!"

Fei
"This isn't like any other
fight!
It's a battle for the
wisdom created by god.
It's life or death.
Whoever controls it,
becomes the true dominator
of the world!
It's obvious the Ministry
will bring the strongest
possible troops.
There is no guarantee
you'll come back alive!"

Elly
"That's exactly why
I want to go..."

Fei
"You don't have the
slightest idea..."

Elly
"What don't I understand!?"

Fei
"If the enemy were only the
Ministry or just mechanical
weapons it would be okay.
But most of the enemies
will be made up of what
were once humans... Humans
just like you and I!"

!

Fei
"I saw them at those
facilities... Gears that
were made out of humans.
They were the same as
Hammer...
Could you now destroy them
after knowing this!?
In order to save ourselves,
can you truly say that you
could kill those who were
once our friends!?
So, do you still want to go
now!?"

Elly
"W, well..."

Fei
"You can't even kill one
person.
Your presence would be
a burden during the fight."

!?

Fei
"You'd just get
in the way..."

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
Don't you think you went
a little too far there?"

Citan
"We cannot blame her.
At least we should
understand her feelings."

Fei
"I know how Elly feels.
I knew she wouldn't have
listened to me if I had
just said, 
'You're not coming!'.
Seeing as she has worked
together with us for such
a long time and all...
That's why I had to
explain it to her like
that..."

Fei
"The people gathered in
Nisan need Elly.
She's gotta realize how
much people are depending
on her.
I can't put her in a
dangerous situation..."

Margie
"But the way you said
it was a little harsh."

Billy
"You didn't have to be so
cold. She was crying, you
know?"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"I am sure she
realizes that."

Bart
"I agree.
Maybe you are the one
who doesn't understand?"

Fei
"Me?...
I don't understand?"

Margie
"A lady's...heart...?"

Billy
"She wants to go,
to be with you, Fei...
Until the end."

Yeah.

Bart
"If I were you...
I'd hold her tight
and say...
'Let's go together!'
...Just like that!"

Margie
"Really?"

Bart
"Um...no...
I mean...
errh..."

Maison
"Young master, don't
overdo yourself now..."

Ah, shut up!

Bart
"Anyhow, why don't you go
ask her to come with you?
Whether she'll go or not,
you should express your
feelings in words.
If you really care about
her, you have to go tell
her."

Citan
"Express your feelings...
right?"

Fei
"I, I didn't mean...!"

Bart
"Too late now.
Everyone knows it."

Citan
"You are not being true
to yourself, are you?"

Margie
"I agree."

Emeralda
"Fei...say it...
straight out..."

Margie
"Go ahead...
Go chase after her!
What are you waiting for?"

Citan
"So...
There is only one gate left
on the surface..."

Bart
"The problem is its
location."

Fei
"But Queen Zephyr said
there are three on earth,
and one in Solaris..."

Sigurd
"According to
Shakhan's report,
each gate is
placed in a triangle
around Solaris..."

Citan
"Let us look at the map
given by the Queen,
which describes the area
before the gates were
placed."

Bart
"What if we try both ways?
Isn't that all it takes?"

Sigurd
"That would be difficult.
I doubt they expected the
2nd gate to be destroyed.
So I'm sure they'll be
serious next time.
We'd better plan it
carefully but quickly."

Citan
"In any case, we will not
be able to avoid Gebler's
interference, will we?"

Fei
"Doc, Elly, where
exactly is Solaris
located?"

Elly
"There is only a map of
Solaris in Solaris.
I didn't even know the
area of this land until
I arrived here."

Fei
"Even in Gebler?"

Elly
"The relations with
earth are only revealed 
to commanders."

Bart
"If that's the case,
even Billy's father may
not know it."

Sigurd
"Jesiah left there in the
middle of it."

Citan
"Sigurd and I were
smugglers
and did not have the time
to look out the window.
On top of that,
when going through the
gate from Solaris,
we transferred to other
places by using the
environmental plane
between each gate.
Remember when we made
contact with the Kislev
gate in the Goliath?
The same thing happens
and we lose all sense of
where we were before."

Fei
"Even if the gate divides
the other space, can't you
recognize its topography?
Like mountains, jungles
and so on?"

Elly
"...I don't think there
were mountains.
More like we were
surrounded by the ocean..."

Bart
"Ocean...
Then it can't be the
north?
This is the pole. It's
all covered with snow."

Fei
"Then it's settled.
The location of the gate
is south of here.
The center of the triangle
is only the ocean.
If the gates are placed
in the highest point in the
north, the center will be
the continent.
Hence, it coincides with
Elly's story."

Citan
"You may be right."

Sigurd
"Wait a minute. There
shouldn't be any facility
over the ocean."

Elly
"Then, underwater?"

Sigurd
"Hmm...
But the whole area around
here is deep.
If it exists,
it must be deep down."

Fei
"The Yggdrasil is a
submarine, right? Then,
what's the problem?"

Bart
"You're crazy!
It is a submarine but
not a bathyscaphe.
It isn't made for deep
sea exploration. The water
pressure would crush us
instantaneously."

Fei
"We have a problem..."

Citan
"We may be able to use the
bathyscaphes or Gears used
by the Salvagers..."

Bart
"'Salvager'?
Right!
That's it!"

??

Bart
"The captain of the Thames
must have tons of them.
He owes us from last time.
Let's go to the Thames."

Citan
"It may be our best
choice for now. Shall
we go to the Thames?"

Citan
"Fei...is it not the time
for you to come out with
your feelings now?"

Bart
"C'mon now!
Go for it!"

Billy
"You don't know how to
treat a lady, do you?"

Rico
"I don't know much about
this kinda thing...
...but Hammer used to
tell me to
'be nice to women!'..."

Emeralda
"Fei...go..."

Chu-Chu
"Don't chu worry about me.
Please hurry and go chu
her!!"

Maria
"That's not the way
to treat her!"

Margie
"Women don't like
insensitive men!"

Maison
"I'm not well versed in
the art of romance."

Margie
"Don't run away!
Be a man and confront
the problem!!"

Citan
"If you go to the engine
room, the old man will
smack you one!!"

Bart
"Hey, stupid!
It's the other room."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yggdrasil Hallway - 1214

Chu-Chu
"I'm changing, so
don't chu come in."

Citan
"This room seems to be
for ladies' use only.
Let us excuse ourselves."

Bart
"Maybe not here..."

Fei isn't here!
I wonder where he went?

So-o-o-rry.
The Shevat agent is in
intensive care... So...
No visitors are allowed!!

(I've always wanted to say
that...!
 "No visitors are allowed!"
Now I'm so-o-o-o happy!!)

Gawd... I've been standing
here for such a long time...
Was I of any help to you?
    Of course
    Hmmm, I dunno

Well I'm happy to hear
that... Even if you're
not being truthful!

Oh yeah...!?
Well...there are a lot of
people who get lost around
here, y'know... Hah!
(Now where was I...!?)

Young master, I've
learned my lesson!

I'll remember to obey
lights-out from now on...
So, please come back alive.

What? Can't find Fei?
N, no, I wouldn't know.
(Not that I was sleeping
on the job or anything...)

Young master, c'mon,
forgive me! Please!

What? Why am I here?
Can't we put that behind us?
It's not like I'm being made
to stand here as punishment
for not obeying lights-out,
or anything like that, is it?
Beyond this door is the
Gear Hangar.
The Gear Shop is located
in the Gear Hangar too!
Now be careful...!
The Gears are so big that
you'll look very small and
you might get lost.

You may not have noticed it,
but even since the time you
guys came here, that tree's
grown a little bit.
It may only be little by
little, but it still means
our hopes and dreams are
also growing to fruition!

Oh, young master!
This one's gotten bigger!
Right now, it's taller
than you, young master.

This is how the land
actually looks like
on the other side of
the invisible barrier.
The Gates should be
set up somewhere here
on this map.

First, the Ignas' Gate is... here.

The 'Ethos' H.Q. in
Aquvy is here, so...

Fei
"Well, logically thinking
the next place could be
here, or..."

Fei
"Here.
One of the two."

Elly
"North or south, huh...
Well, at least we have even
chances of guessing which."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1222
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Elly, you are awake."

Elly
"Ah, oooooh..."

Elly
"Where am I...?
I was with Fei, heading
for the rear block...
Fei...!
Where are you, Fei?"

Rumble rumble

Elly
"Am I awake...?
What were you doing!?"

Fei
"I was looking around
inside here. There's
less than 2 days worth..."

Elly
"Of what?"

Fei
"Food.
We're lucky we
even found any."

Elly
"But, where is everyone!?
Are we the only survivors?"

Fei
"We gotta do something.
Guess I'll go catch some
fish."

Elly
"Fei!"

Fei
"...They're okay."

Elly
"What?"

Fei
"They're okay...doc, Rico,
Hammer, everyone... They're
all going to be okay."

You little...!

Hold it!

Elly
"I knew it...I thought
this thing was floating
unusually...
But even knowing that,
there's no way we can get
them out...right?
They're right under us,
but covered by water and
a thick wall."

Elly
"It's probably
Weltall and
Vierge.
For better or worse, they
have stuck by us this far.
...But, they are useless
now at this point though."

Elly
"It appears our Gears
are underneath here, Fei.
But, we can't reach them...
...What're you doing, Fei?"

Fei
"What am I doing?
Can't you tell...?
I'm trying to catch a fish!
This one's been jumping up
and down, right in front of
me, trying to make me look
like a fool..."

Fei
"You little punk!
I see you!"

Elly
"Uh, umm, you're not
going to catch it and
eat it are you?"

Fei
"If we don't eat,
we're gonna die...
...Alright!! I gotcha!!"

Elly
"You're joking.
You'll get sick."

Fei
"You're not gonna eat?
Let me see... We need
something to cook it with."

...

Elly
"Hey, come on, stop it.
I'm not to blame if you
get sick and die."

Fei
"Don't worry.
Once it's in your stomach
it's all the same."

Elly
"I'm not going to...
Fei!! Look, there..."

Fei
"What!?
Did the fish get away?"

Fei
"What're you talking
about?
It's still there...
What the...!?
...That's...!"

Fei
"That's...that thing I saw
in the desert. It's flying
a lot higher this time."

Elly
"It's Shevat...
That's its usual altitude."

Fei
"Shevat...
Where have I heard...
Yeah, that's right...
That weird masked man!
He said my father was
in its military...
So that saucer is what doc
and that masked man said
was the country my father
and mother lived in?"

Elly
"Really? I wouldn't know...
It's a country outside the
reach of Solaris.
Shevat uses the same kind
of barrier that Solaris
does, so you can't reach
it by conventional means."

Fei
"How can something that
flys that high in the
sky be a 'country'?"

Elly
"Yes. I don't blame you
for being so surprised.
It usually hovers over
the region known as the
Aquvy islands area.
You probably saw it on some
sort of special mission.
That's why it was flying so
low..."

Fei
"Shevat..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1224
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It...seems like
we've drifted
further off.

...Constantly drifting...
Sounds like me right now.

What do you mean?

I've just been drifting
around...being lead by
circumstances.

No...
that's not right.
In Aveh,
you helped Bart
when he needed it.
And in Kislev,
you gave your all
to defend, to
save everyone.
You've even shown
concern for me
many times.

No...
I'm just no good.

Why?

Probably deep inside,
I'm not really trying
to help.
Somehow, I get the
feeling that all I've
done I did because I
wanted to be needed.
That if I did something
for them...then maybe,
I'd have a
place to belong...
There's a side of me that
comforts itself like that.
That doesn't mean I don't
want to help. But, that
doesn't mean I really want
to help either.
It might not be 'nothing',
but it sure isn't the
'whole' either.
I'd been drifting, led
around until I met you,
Elly.
Now, we're stranded out
in the ocean.
I'm sorry...I got
you involved.

It's okay.
Don't worry about me.
I've been thinking
why I'm here.
I could've just
gone back.
But for some reason
I didn't...
Probably because
you said it's better
to do something
than nothing.
I think that's why
I felt I had to do
something.
It's OK not to
feel 'whole'.
Even if you only feel
partly complete, if
you repeat that enough,
eventually it'll be
'whole'.
A part...
is better than
zero.

You're right...
I'm sorry...

Fei
"If we're saved...
will you go back?"

Elly
"I probably won't go back
to my squad.
Right now, I really don't
want to be there...
Besides, I could probably
do something else...
I don't have to be in the
army.
So, I'm thinking of going
back to my country."

Fei
"Is that possible?
But what about the army?"

Elly
"It's not like anyone
knows what I did.
They've probably already
classified me as MIA."

Fei
"Hmm.
I hope at least
you'll survive.
I'm sure you'll
find what you
want to do in
your life."

Elly
"You said...
something about...
being comforted."

Fei
"Yes."

Elly
"Don't be too hard on
yourself. Everyone wants
to be needed at times.
All of us want to give
something inside ourselves
to others to be accepted.
...Even me.
Remember how you forced
yourself to eat those
emergency rations?"

UUUURRRGHH!

Elly
"Hey...are you okay?"

Elly
"I told you not to eat
such a gross looking
animal."

Fei
"It tastes horrible. The
last time I had food this
bad was doc's cooking."

?

Fei
"But unless we do
something we're
going to die."

Elly
"I guess there's no other
way. I was hoping to save
this a little longer..."

Elly
"This should hold us
for another day...
But it's only for emergency
calories so I can't promise
how good it'll taste."

Fei
"Huh!?
What?
It's dry and crumbly?"

Elly
"I thought so...
You don't like it,
do you?"

Fei
"Wha? N, no...
It's good.
Yeah, ah, it's great.
Whatever you'd share
with me couldn't be
that bad, could it?"

Elly
"You forced yourself to
eat those rations earlier,
didn't you?
For me to survive, it
would have been better
not to share it.
But, watching you eat it
even though it tasted bad
comforted me.
I felt glad that I shared
it with you... It made me
feel a little better."

Fei
"For your own sake?"

Elly
"Yes, for my own sake.
Selfish, I admit.
But, I think it's okay to
be that way at first.
But little by little you
learn about your own
happiness...
And someday you are able to
share that important part
of you with someone else.
Some...day."

Elly
"Ah..."

Fei
"?
What's up?"

Elly
"...Nothing. It just felt
as though I've told you
the same thing long ago...
It must be my imagination.
I couldn't have said it to
you before, because we've
only just met, haven't we?"

Elly
"Yes, it's probably
just my imagination..."

Fei
"Elly!
Hey, Elly!
Wake up!"

Elly
"Good morning, Fei.
You're up early."

Fei
"No time for formalities.
Look at that!!"

Elly
"Huh?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1228
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Hey, that's..."

Rico
"Oh come on, Citan.
Just when I thought
we were saved, now we're
gonna be turned into
Swiss cheese."

Citan
"We are not particularly
liked here, are we?"

!

Citan
"Fei!
Elly!
You are all right."

Elly
"Somehow."

Rico
"This is no time for
tearful reunions."

Fei
"Yeah...
Where's Bart?"

Citan
"He is fighting below.
He said he was going to
hold them back until the
depth charges were ready.
But he left without the
proper hydropreps...
We are busy trying to
ready the depth charges.
Your Gears should be able
to handle underwater
warfare to some extent.
Go help him out."

Fei
"Got it.
Elly, let's go."

Sigurd
"Young master! Depth
charges will be dropped!
Please stand back!"

Kelvena
"Enough already!
Dominia!
Retreat!"

Dominia
"Come on Elhaym!
Show me your
true self!!"

Dominia
"Hyah!
That was nothing.
Come on, come on!"

Dominia
"Tch!
I was so close.
But...don't think I'll
be leaving empty-handed,
now!"

Elly
"Wh, what!?"

Elly
"Aaaaaahhhhhh!"

Fei
"Elly!?"

-------------------------------------------------------

Citan
"Fei,
where is Elly?"

Fei
"The enemy...
took her."

Bart
"Heh,
I doubt that..."

Fei
"Bart, what do you
mean!?"

Citan
"Stop it!!
Fei!
This is no time for
bickering.
For now, we must find a
place to finish repairing
the Yggdrasil."

Fei
"......Don't worry.
The ship that saved
us is nearby.
They call it the Thames,
and it's about the size of
a small city.
Their Captain can help us."

Rico
"That's......
the Thames...?"

Dominia
"If you hadn't..."

Dominia
"...been around..."

Dominia
"I'll never forgive
you..."

Dominia
"You..."

Dominia
"TRAITOR!!"

Bart
"Here they come!"

Elly
"Hey, that's..."

Bart
"...Whew.
She doesn't know
when to quit."

Elly
"Wh-what?"

Fei
"Below!"

Bart
"Is it what I think it
is?"

Elly
"..."

"Uh! You again!?"

Fei
"What are you
talking about!?"

Fei
"Uuaaaaahhhhh!"

Elly
"Fei!!"

Elly
"Fei!!"

Ramsus
"Miang,
is that him?"

Ramsus
"Right.
I've got him!"

Ramsus
"I have been
looking for you!
My arch rival!!"

Ramsus
"...I see you have a
different machine...
So, what happened to
your 'other Gear'!?"

Ramsus
"Not to matter...
At any rate, until
I eliminate you,
there will never be
any 'light' for me!!"

Ramsus
"Tch!
Is that all you
have to give!!
Well too bad!
No matter what...
I can't let you live!"

Ramsus
"And now for the
'coup de grace'!!"

Ramsus
"Wh, what!?
Aerods!?
Who the...!?"

Ramsus
"!!
Uuuooohhhh!"

Ramsus
"Tch!
My main tank...
I almost had him!
Dammit!
...We have to
retreat, Miang!"

Miang
"Yes, he's in the
black Gear in the
center there."

1230 - Thames Big Joe?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Big Joe
"I lose. 
Here's your present.
Adios."

 
 Received LongDarkCoat.

Big Joe
"Ha, how easy it is
to beat you, amigo!
Go away."

Big Joe
"Ha...a draw.
Very lucky for you
senor..."

Big Joe
"Hey, hombre. You
disturbin' our amore time?"
    Yes
    No

Big Joe
"Si? Maybe you need some
manners, muchacho!"

Big Joe
"Well then go away."

Oh Joe, mi amore!

Bart
"Sorry about what I
said earlier..."

Fei
"It's alright. I was at
fault too. I haven't seen
you in such a long time.
We shouldn't be fighting."

Bart
"Sigh...
The Yggdrasil II was
constructed so quickly
we had no time to ready
its depth charges.
Also it was my fault we
didn't have depth charges
because I prioritized the
Bart Missiles over...
...everything else."

Fei
"Bart Missiles?"

Bart
"Oh uh...um, well,
they're not that
great anyway."

Fei
"?
Anyway, I'm glad you're
okay.
I always knew that you'd
be alive."

Bart
"Of course.
I'm Bart the immortal.
Whaddya trying to say...?
But this time I got reamed
by a red Gear monster."

Fei
"A red Gear..."

Bart
"Yeah. He beat me and then
left us to sink into the
sand.
But this next part sounds
wild.
We sank into this huge cave
under the sand! And then
a sand cruiser just like
the Yggdrasil was there!
We replaced the usable
parts and the bridge and
remodeled it."

Citan
"Frankly, I do not believe
it myself. It looks
the same but it can float.
Most likely it is the
Yggdrasil's prototype."

Bart
"People lived there
long ago and they
had many weapons.
That's how we got them."

Citan
"Bart already showed me.
Those weapons are most
likely...from Shevat."

Fei
"Shevat......
you mean the aerial..."

Bart
"More importantly, we
should go say 'ahoy'
to the Captain."

Fei
"...Yeah."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1232 - Thames Doctor
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Doctor
"What, are you injured?"
    Yes
    No

Doctor
"I see. Just plop down
and sleep over there."

Doctor
"Don't ever come back."

Doctor
"Then you have no
business here.
Out, get out!"

Doctor
"Jeez, only drunkards 
and bullies come here..."

Doctor
"Then get out.
There are lots of injured
people from that big
fishbowl thing."

The wind...
is calling my name.
...Sigh...

The sea...
is weeping.
...Sigh...

Only I......survived.
My comrades were taken off
and eaten by the Wels...

Boy was it a shock. We were
all enthused about being
able to finally dig up stuff
at the excavation site.
Then...ZAP!...
This beam went by!
It was so bright, I thought
my eyes were gonna burn up.
But then a Gear from Thames
saved me.
Boy am I ever thankful...!
But why did that fishbowl
thing attack us? Was it
trying to get at the site?"

When I'm drunk I don't get
any further than this bed.

Anna
"My husband was eaten by
that Reaper -Wels- thing...
We three were the only ones
saved. What do we do now?"

Lance
"Hey, are you picking
on my mom?"

Kanna
"What about dad?"

Doctor
"...I don't know. 
But for now he's on life 
support......"

Citan
"...You mean... 
He will be alright...?"

Doctor
"...I guarantee nothing. 
I don't know why he's like
this in the first place."

Bart
"..."

Elly
"...My fault?
...I..."

Doctor
"...Then there is hope
...at the infirmary in
the 'Ethos' headquarters."

!

Elly
"Fei...
Can you save Fei?"

Doctor
"I cannot guarantee it.
But if we were to take
him to the 'Ethos'
headquarters' hospital..."

Elly
"Then could we save him?"

Doctor
"I think then that he
would most probably
pull through alright...
But unfortunately, ordinary
citizens are only allowed
into the main hall at
the 'Ethos' headquarters.
You would have to become a
monk, or be introduced by
someone in the 'Ethos'..."

Elly
"..."

Doctor
"Ah, I just remembered.
I heard that the Etone,
-'atoners of sin'-,
are coming to Thames
from the 'Ethos' H.Q...."

Citan
"What purpose do such
Etone from the 'Ethos'
have here?"

Doctor
"They're coming here
to do some type of
investigation."

Bart
"Etone...
What are they?"

Doctor
"They are religious people
from the 'Ethos' who cleanse
away the 'Reapers' or -Wels-
that appear here in Aquvy."

Elly
"So why don't we ask them?"

Doctor
"I'll ask them if they can
help us, but I don't know
if they will...
I guess there is no harm
in asking though..."

Elly
"Alright. Let's go look
for them."

Citan
"I will go with Fei and
the life support machines
to the Yggdrasil.
Bart and Elly, you two go
look for the Etone."

Bart
"...Right."

1234 - Thames Underground Dock
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"I don't really like
wandering around..."

...

Fei
"What? 
Who's that?"

Fei
"What are you doing?"

Elly
"Um...
Thanks for helping."

Elly
"Why are you being
so kind?"

...

Elly
"They don't look like...
such bad people."

...

...

This is the underground
dock. Your Gears are 
being repaired here.

This is the underground dock.
Your ship is moored here.

This is the top of the tower.
The limitless sky!
The sea!
It'll be smooth sailing.

This is the top of the tower.
No Wels.
No Wels...
...May there not be any Wels.

This is the crane room.
We're not fishing up any
big items today.

Captain
"Hardy, I see you've
come back to visit.
Remember this."

Hang on to your hats!!

From the folks at Square!!

Xenogears!!

ON  SALE NOW!!!

Captain
"Gahahahaha..."

Captain
"You're the two winos who
floated in with the Gears."

Captain
"Gahahahaha. Well, don't
take it so badly.
For us, anything we pull
out of the sea is treasure.
And you're a really big
important treasure.
We were really careful."

Captain
"What a pretty lady.
Oh, don't make that face.
I won't bite.
I'll return your Gears
to you squeaky clean."

Captain
"That's because..."

I am!

a man!

of the sea!

Captain
"Gahahaha..."

Captain
"You're probably starved.
I'll get you some food."

Captain
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaans!
I'll welcome the guests!
You take care of the rest."

Captain
"Of course I know that. 
How can you be so calm?"

Captain
"Hmph, yeah yeah."

Captain
"Lemme go and get
things ready."

Captain
"Go wait up on the deck.
I'll move 'em up there."

Captain
"Everything's okay.
The lady came back
unharmed."

Captain
"The Etones?
Oh, those guys who were
here earlier...
They left saying they had
to go investigate something.
They might be on the deck
near the supply entrance."

Captain
"If you're gonna mess with
them, we'll help however we
can.
If you wanna know about the
fishbowl headed towards the
excavation site, ask Hans."

Captain
"Oh, Citan.
You came because
you were worried?"

Citan
"Yes, you could say that.
But you seem to be better
off than I expected."

Captain
"Of course."

We are

Men!

of the Sea!!

Captain
"...Is what I'd like to
say...
...but the truth is the
situation's been pretty
bad.
We've got some that are
injured badly and some
that are fatal.
But considering what
happened to the other
ships, we're in no position
to complain.
And by the way, Citan. What
the hell is up with that
fishbowl thing?
It came out of nowhere and
kicked our butts and left
behind Wels.
And then, it headed for
some obscure excavation
site where there's supposed
to be nothing.
Odd, since we were sent
to go to a more deeper and
bigger excavation site."

Citan
"Just as I thought..."

Captain
"Some say they saw a huge
Gear-like monster.
It seemed like it was
guiding that fishbowl thing
to the excavation site.
Or so I'm told."

Citan
"Stone...
It appears there is
something there for sure."

Captain
"Call it salvager's
intuition, but I don't
wanna get any closer.
And Citan, is that fishbowl
an enemy of yours?"

Citan
"You...
could say that."

Captain
"Well, I won't ask for
revenge.
But I can't just sit back
and do nothing. If you're
against it, we'll help any
way we can.
You can ask Hans anything
about the site."

Captain
"What's wrong?
What do you need?
Point x1507, z1235?
Hans, does that sound
familiar?"

Hans
"It's Sargasso point."

Captain
"What?
The Sargasso?"

Fei
"Sargasso, what's that?"

Captain
"It's a cave formed from
microbes over many years.
It's supposed to have
hidden treasure but no
one's ever returned from
there.
The story is that the cave
itself is alive. Are you
going to the Sargasso?"

Fei
"It looks like it."

Captain
"Your Gears can't dive that
deep. If they did, you
would not be able to move.
Equip your underwater gear
here. Then take your ship
as far as you can and dive
in with your Gear.
I'll go wake those
winos up, right now."

Fei
"Really? It's okay with
you? Thanks for always
helping us out, Captain."

Captain
"Don't mention it."

Captain
"It looks like
they're done."

Fei
"That was fast."

Captain
"Of course.
We're..."

Fei
"Men, of the sea, right?"

Captain
"Blimey. 
I think he's got it.
Take care then."

Fei
"Yeah."

Captain
"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell
you how to operate them
underwater.
It's easy. You can jump in
water without your feet
touching the ground. Keep
jumping to build up speed.
You can swim pretty well in
a Gear, but there may be
places you can't get past
if you don't do it well."

Fei
"Got it.
Thanks."

Captain
"No need for thanks.
Maybe you can buy something
from our Gear shop. 
Looks like there be some
new booty to sell."

Captain
"Feel free to come back
to Thames anytime.
There's always room at
our dock for your ship."

You talked to the Captain?
He's nice and all but...

Hans
"The one wandering around
over there's the Captain."

Hans
"Looks like there's gonna
be some trouble."

Hans
"Captain's great, isn't he?
Because of him the work
doesn't run out."

Hans
"Fishbowl was headed
due north.
The north edge of
that island...
But why? There's nothing
there but a small mine."

Hans
"Since our work with the
'Ethos' has deep sixed
we've lost our 'porpoise'!
Guess we'll just have to
stick with wandering the
seas and salvaging.
Seems Thames will have to
continue this haphazard
lifestyle after all."

Let me introduce my
self. I'm Hans, the
ship's first mate.

Hans
"Yessir.
Just don't over do it."

Hans
"The captain and everyone
are so irresponsible."

I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.
I'm not losing it to some
young upstart.

I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.
But when Wels attacked, I
thought about running.

You can talk to other
areas aboard the Thames
through that intercom.

I remember seein' a high
tower a long time ago. It
was called Babel Tower.
Even I can't see the top of
it, and my eyes are good!
They say the Reapers called
Wels come from there.

I was surprised by the
Wels. They said they
came from Babel Tower.

Huh?
Isn't this a beer hall?

Huh?
Wels?
Where's Wels?

...

Fei
"!
That ship!"

Elly
"What?
What's wrong?"

Fei
"That's the
Yggdrasil!"

Elly
"Isn't that Bart's ship?"

Fei
"Yeah.
He's still alive.
Alright!
We can't just sit here!
Let's go!"

Elly
"Go where?"

Fei
"To help, what else?"

Elly
"Without a Gear?"

Fei
"Hmm..."

Captain
"Hold yer horses."

Captain
"Dock, this is the
bridge! How are our
guests' Gears?"

The repairs will
be done shortly.

Captain
"Two minutes."

Huh?

Captain
"Finish in two minutes!
Then take them out 
through the supply 
entrance to the deck!"

Y, yessir!

Captain
"Your Gears are being
moved to the deck.
Go get'em.
If you need to you can
buy equipment at the
supply entrance shop."

Hans
"What are you saying
Captain?
What if we get bombed
while we're caught up in
the middle of a fight?"

Captain
"Be quiet!!
Our guests are fighting
to save their friends.
Don't get in the way!
If we don't help, it'll
tarnish the men of the
sea's good name!!"

Hans
"......Yessir.
But the Thames itself will
not join in any fights."

Fei
"Thanks. That's more
than enough."

Captain
"They've got guts starting
a fight next to the Thames!
It gets my blood boiling!"

Captain
"Hey Hans, I haven't
fired the big gun in
a long time.
How about we take a
shot or two?"

Hans
"Are you kidding?
Why get the Thames involved
in a fight between sides
who are neither enemies 
nor allies?
And that big gun is nothing
but a useless piece of junk
you tacked onto the Thames
in a drunken stupor!"

Captain
"You just don't
understand the code of
the men of the sea..."

Captain
"It seems like a
submarine is under
attack."

Fei
"Submarine?"

Captain
"I see you've brought
along another strapping
young lad."

Bart
"I'm Bart. Thanks for
letting my ship dock here."

Captain
"Gahahahahahahaha.
This's great. Ya come to
ask about the ship?"

Bart
"My submarine, Yggdrasil,
was damaged by an enemy
attack...
It'll be out of operation
for a little while..."

Margie
"Bart!
You're terrible.
You went on without me!"

Bart
"Aw Margie?
Just when I'm starting
to sound like a captain."

Margie
"I get away from Nisan
but then I'm stuck on
the Yggdrasil.
I'm sick of it.
Captain?
Hi, I'm Marguerite."

Bart
"Awww man! Look, we're
having a man to man talk
here.
So Margie, why don't you
go back to the Yggdrasil."

Margie
"You're terrible!
You're starting to
sound like Sig."

Bart
"What!
Me, like Sig?"

Margie
"You're always so
thoughtless, Bart.
Fei and the others
were floating around
because you fired on
that craft impulsively."

Bart
"Whoa, st, stupid,
you're not supposed to..."

Fei
"Bart...?
You...didn't...
No...you didn't..."

Citan
"It is true, Fei."

Bart
"Couldn't be helped.
How could I have known
you were..."

Fei
"I'm so disgusted, I
don't have anything
to say..."

Bart
"Don't get so mad."

Bart
"Tch. I shouldn't have
brought you out
of Nisan."

Margie
"I heard that,
you big jerk!"

Captain
"Gahahahaha.
Great, great.
It's great to be young."

Captain
"Hey, kiddo.
You supposed to be some
kinda pirate?"

Bart
"Oh yeah.
A man of the sea!
I was a man of the
desert but..."

Captain
"Alright!!
Even better.
Yes, man of the sea!
Bart, right?
I'll show you to our
famous beer hall."

Captain
"My lady, may I borrow
this fellow?"

Margie
"What a weird guy."

Margie
"Fei, are you mad
about Bart?"

Fei
"No that's not it..."

Margie
"......About Elly then?"

Fei
"......Yeah."

Margie
"It'll all be okay.
If you're so worried,
why don't you go rescue
her?"

Margie
"Just like...
Bart helped me out."

Fei
"......"

Fei
"Where's Elly?"

Hans
"She's seeing to the
Gear. She will be
along any time now."

Bart
"You mean...
she was able to escape?"

Captain
"Well it's good for you.
Right, Fei?"

Fei
"Ah, yeah."

Fei
"Elly, are you okay?"

Elly
"...Yeah."

Bart
"..."

Elly
"What's that submarine?"

Fei
"Oh, you mean the
Yggdrasil?
It took a bad bashing,
so now it's here, at
Thames, for repairs."

Elly
"I see...
Can I rest for a 
while?
...I'm exhausted."

Fei
"That's a good idea."

Bart
"Fei, it's my ship."

Captain
"Oi, oi.
She said she's tired.
Let her rest."

Elly
"Well, I'm going."

Bart
"...
I don't like this."

Fei
"Bart you're still..."

Bart
"It's not like that.
She won't backstab us.
I was raised around thugs
and charlatans. I can
tell just by looking
in her eyes."

Fei
"Then you accept Elly..."

Bart
"That's why I can't.
She may be okay with it.
But what about her family
back home? Do you think
she can live with that?
Can she do that? Just get
rid of her family?
She has to decide.
She...Elly is probably
worrying about that.
We can't involve people
who have attachments."

Fei
"Bart..."

Bart
"Hmph, well do whatever
you want."

Captain
"What's that!?
Did you see that huge
fishbowl thing?"

Hans
"What are you asking
me for...?"

Captain
"Weren't the other
salvager fleets almost
blown away by one shot?
Is this the way the
'Ethos' greets us?"

Hans
"I seriously doubt that!
Why do they have to 
attack us? We only
came to help with 
excavations..."

C, captain, Wels Reapers!
Reapers are coming out of
that fishbowl thing in the
dozens!

Captain
"What!?"

Hans
"Why...?
This can't be happening..."

Captain
"......
Launch the Gears!
Load the big gun!"

Hans
"Captain!?"

Captain
"Alright, y'all!
We're going to assist and
rescue any of the survivors
from the other ships...
...if at all possible while
trying to retreat!
And shoot down those Wels
with our two guns!
Don't let those filthy
Wels get near our Thames!"

Captain
"Hans!
Look alive!
Take the helm!
We'll show that fishbowl
thing how real men of
the sea retreat!"

Hans
"Y, yessir!"

Fei
"Are you always wandering
the seas like this?"

Fei
"Why is the 'Ethos'
involved...?"

...

Elly
"Big job?"

...

Bart
"Wah ha ha ha."

Bart
"They came out...
one after another...slam,
bam, crash...that's 
how it happened..."

Captain
"Took you a while, but
things aren't ready yet."

Captain
"Hey, hurry it up!
Don't make our
guests wait."

Captain
"Sorry, there's no place
to sit around here."

Captain
"But, isn't the view just
splendid from here? This
beer hall is Thames' pride.
You probably think it's a
wee bit peculiar having a
beer hall right next to the
bridge, but tis fine by me.
If you don't take time in
life to enjoy a drink, you
will be swallowed by the
waves of anxiety...
...But we don't have that
problem. Thanks to this
beer hall, everyone here is
too sloshed to worry!"

Captain
"Well, normally.
There is that crane that
fished you out. 
We use that or the Gears
to pull up treasure from
the sea. We're Salvagers.
Recently however,
there has been almost
no treasure...
just little things.
Since we've started the
big job, well, that's all
we've had."

Captain
"Oh, that's a job for the
'Ethos'.
The 'Ethos' is planning
a really big salvage next.
I don't know the details
but, looks like we'll be
searching for some buried
treasure."

Captain
"Who knows... But, we're
dependent on the 'Ethos'
to buy our stuff.
So, it won't look good
if we turn the job down."

Captain
"Well, dinner's finally
ready. Let's eat."

Captain
"Gahahahha."

Captain, your first
mate is calling you.

Bart
"They came out...
one after another...
slam, bam, crash...
that's how it happened..."

Fei
"Hey Bart, Sigurd was
asking about you..."

Captain
"Gahahahahaha.
Of course, if you're not 
strong, you can't be a
man of the sea."

Bart
"Yeah, check this arm
out..."

Proof!

Of the men!

Of the sea!!

Captain, your first
mate is calling you.

Captain
"Oi, he's interrupting
our men of the sea story.
That Hans, he's such
an unrefined chap.
What does he want now?"

Our Lady seems
to have returned...

Fei
"Our Lady...
Oh, you mean Elly!"

Captain
"Fool! 
Why didn't you
tell me earlier."

Well...

Fei
"Well, let's go."

Elly
"I know you haven't eaten
for a while but how can
you eat so much?"

Captain
"Gah ha ha ha ha...
This is great, 
this is great. 
I like how you eat.
You weren't drifting 
around for nuthin'..."

Men have!

Courage!

And have Appetites!

Captain
"Gah ha hah..."

Elly
"?
Did we just shake?"

Fei
"You're just imagining it."

Elly
"I don't think so!"

Captain
"Got it.
I'm on the way."

Captain
"Looks like something's
up. Sorry, but I have to
return to the bridge."

Captain
"But please, 
enjoy yourselves."

Fei
"Elly, is that a 
water spout?"

Elly
"It's too far, I can't 
see very well. But it
looks like...a battle!"

Fei
"Let's go to the 
bridge too."

Elly
"Okay."

There's nuttin' betta
than a drink after work.

Hey, hey, I've never seen
you workin' around here.

Huh? Well, don't worry
'bout the details
too much.

Well, let's toast to
the Thames' survival!"

Now we can drink
some more.

Amen to that!

Awwwww man!
I'd die for this
glass of booze.

Hey, how many times
do you plan on dying?

No kidding.

But what will our 
next job be?

What's your job?

Oh, this and that.
Forget about that.

Kids these days are
such wimpy drinkers.

They're such wimpy
drinkers, that's why they
got beat by the fishbowl
thing.

Hey, you're doing
pretty good.

 
Received Premier Shoes.

Ha, you're no
competition.

Hey let's take it
easy today.

You're new!
Want me to teach you?
    Yeah
    No thanks

...Really?
    Yes
    No

...Do it?
    Yes
    No

Hmmph, beat it.

Hmmph, you have no pride.

Well, I'll teach you then!!

Hmmph, don't regret it!

Hey, are yush 
lishenin' t' me...!

Hey, yush din't drink
yous, dat wash mine.

Hey, do something about
this old drunk.

Hey, do something with 
this old drunk. He's
worse company than Wels.

Nope.
I'm not trying to drink.

What, you didn't drink
anything? Well then don't
worry 'bout it.

Hey man, I've got a good 
cure for drinking too
much.

 
 Received Mentsol.

Men are stupid.
They're so happy
with that crap.

Men are so weak. 
They try to forget about
their fear of the Reapers
with that crap.

I am the maste~r
The best maste~r
Thames' maste~r.

Hey, I'm nosh drunk.

I've never been on dry 
land since I was born.
Think about it. You have 
dirt on your feet. 
How can you do that?

I didn't go ashore this 
time either. Even though
I thought I would.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1238
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Received Gold Nugget.

Hey! 
If you need something
from my store, go talk
to my stupid son.

Hey!
I'm not closing down even
if the Wels show up.
If you need something,
talk to my stupid son.

Hey!
You've got your eyes on
something good...Damn.
You know what this is?

...is what it is.
Pretty cool, huh?

...

Hey, wait a minute.
This isn't for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

Hey!
For being so young you
have good taste. Damn.
This is...

...is what it is.
Isn't this just bad?

...

Hey, wait a minute.
This is not for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

Hey!
I'm damn sure you'll like
this.
This is...

Oh?

Ohhh?

...is what it is.
Isn't this just great?

...

Hey, wait a minute.
This is not for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

Whaddya saying?
Stupid kid!!
There ain't no way you
could ever understand
the soul and romance of
a Thames' man!

Hey, come on in.

Damn!!
You dumb old man.
All you make is useless
crap! Why don't you make
something that'll sell!?

What the?
The soul of a Thames' man!?
If they were all as dumb as
you, the Thames'd have gone
under long ago!"

Hey, have you met the
Captain yet? He is sooo
cool! I wanna grow up to
be just like him.

I am!

A man!

of the sea...
...Hey wait? Oops.

It's over here.
I still need more
practice.

I'm sure the Wels are
followin' us 'cus of the
Captain.

Men!

of the sea!

never lose......
...Hey!

Ah, here,
yep, just a little more.

Hey, welcome.
Rare finds from the sea
bottom on parade.

Come again soon.

My lil' sister pushed me.
She always picks on me.
I'm so scared.

My lil' sister pushed me.
She always bullies me.
I'm so scared.
I'm scared of the Wels too.

My big brother's a real
wimp, he's scared of
heights...
Pathetic. 
Just calm down.

My big brother is so scared
of the Wels he won't go to
the bathroom alone.
Pathetic.
Just calm down.

It's so...hot.

The Reapers...are scary.

It's so...hot.

The Reapers...are scary.

I lost.
You get this.
Let's play again.

 
 Received a Zetasol DX.

 
 Received a Physimentsol.

 
 Received a Rosesol.

 
 Received a Rosesol S.

 
 Received a Zetasol.

 
 Received an Aquasol S.

 
Received a DeathBlower1.

Hmm, you're not
ready yet.

Hmm, you're not
ready yet.

Hey you look good.
Wanna play?
    Okay
    Nope

Sigh,
you'll be sorry.

I see, it must be
for your health.

Wow, you suck. Why don't
you come back when you've
gotten a little better!
You'd better practice
somewhere other than
Thames. What? You don't
know what I'm talking
about? Hah! I KNOW you
know what I'm talking
about!

Queenie is so strong.

Queenie is so beautiful.

I was so surprised
there are people living
afloat on the vast sea.
On top of that, you
were with two Gears.
That's unheard of.

Elly
"Thanks. 
You helped us out..."

You'd better thank the
Captain. 
The one who gave the order
for us to pull you two
floaters out was the
Captain o' the Thames.

Fei
"Thames? 
Captain...?"

The Thames, the city at sea.
That is where you are now.
The captain here is a bit
of a strange old chap.
You'll see when you meet
him. That's not to say
he's a bad old blighter.

Elly
"Um...
What about our Gears?"

Don't worry about it. We
put them inside the Thames
through the supply dock.
Sea water got inside so
it'll take some time to
fix them.

Fei
"You're repairing 
them for us?"

Pretty strange for us to
be so nice, I bet that's
what you're thinking.
But really, we had no
choice because it's the
Captain's orders...

Well, I have to go now.
I'm a busy guy, y'know!
Come to the bridge after
you've looked around the
ship a while.
I'm sure the Captain would
want to meet you.

Elly
"Fei, 
what's wrong?"

Fei
"I feel like I've seen
that guy somewhere
before...
Never mind."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where are you going?
    4F (Bridge)
    3F (Beer Hall)
    2F (Sick Bay)
    1F (Deck)
    B1F (Supply entrance)
    B2F (Dock)
    Nevermind

Oh, I feel sick.
Oh please
don't spin it
don't spin it...

Don't spin it!!
Uhhh!!

Bart
"I...didn't want to 
get her involved."

Fei
"You mean Margie...
Sorry, I know I promised...
that if anything happened,
I would protect Margie
and the people of Nisan."

Bart
"You're worried about that?
It's okay, you've had it
tough too.
I made it okay. That's my
job. When the
Yggdrasil's fixed, I'm
going on straight ahead..."

Bart
"Of course I know Nisan's
in danger. 
But since everything's
messed up there, I thought
now would be a good time
to sneak in there.
I didn't plan on taking
her along. As long as I
knew she was safe there."

Citan
"But I certainly doubt
Shakhan will just stand by
and do nothing..."

Bart
"That's what the people
from her Sect said too.
But it's still risky,
so they say they want
me to stay close to
her and protect her."

Fei
"Really...
And you're okay with
that?"

Bart
"...Yeah."

Ya know, awhile ago,
I found treasure that's
thi----s big.

What're you talkin'
about? I found one that's
thi-------s big!

I found one that's 
thi-----------

...---s...pant...pant
...big.

Well I got one 
thi-----------
-----------

...---s...pant...pant...
pant...? Huh?
What was I talkin' about?

HEY!!

Oh noooooo!
B...boss!!

You have too many
Micas.

 Received a Mica.

You have too many
Lunar Rods.

 Received a Lunar Rod.

You have too many
SerpentGWhips.
 
Received a SerpentGWhip.

You have too many
D Circuits.
 
 Received a D Circuit.

Not quite!!
You thought there'd
be treasure.

Whoa, a customer?

Whoa, a customer?
We've got a lot of new
parts.

Well, come again.

...You're
awesome! You're probably
the best salvager in the
world...

R...really?
Looks like you're finally
beginning to appreciate
my greatness.

They say that girl is
crazy about treasure.
Someday, I'll become a
world renowned treasure
hunter and give her all
my treasure.

I wonder what they
brought in today?

Cranes...
are cool!

Hey pal, will ya
listen to my problems?
    Sure
    Nah

Until recently, I've always
wanted to be a seaman and
navigate the Thames!!
That was my plan...
But, lookin' at all that
treasure and stuff bein'
moved around...
...Well, it made me wanna
become a master crane
operator so I could control
that machine at my will...

What'ya think I should do?
    Become a crane master
    Be a seaman
    I don't know

Yeah, you're right...
a crane master.

Yeah, you're right...
a seaman.

Yeah, you're right...
It'd be best if I
decided myself.

Hmph! Don't need your
help. I can figure it out
on my own.

The other day, I saw
a Gear fighting and
it made me want to be
a Gear pilot...sigh...
So many choices.

Humph! Him... He's always
drinkin' in the middle
of the day!

Oh yeah!!! 
I...don't need ta do no
job..bu!

Yeah!!! 
I...on't nee..tooo...do
...job...

This gun is totally
coooool! With this, I can
blow away any bad guy!
BAM! 
BLAM! BOOM! 
Just thinking about it
gives me a rush!

That's it! I'm gonna
be a Wels hunter!
BLAM! BAM! KABLAM!
Wast'em all! Just call me
the Wels Lady Hunter...

Hmmm...I've got a bad
feeling about this...

This new job the 'Ethos' sent
me on is my first BIG job.
I'm a little worried whether
I'll be able to do it or not.
They want me to go down
deeeep and get something
unimaginably big. Something
awesome's down there.

That job from the
'Ethos' was ruined.
Unfortunately, I'll have
to delay that job...but
I'm a bit relieved.

This is the supply entrance...
Uh, I already told you that.

This is the supply
entrance.
This is where all the
treasure, armor and other
materials are brought up
from the sea.

This is the supply
entrance...Uh,
I already told you that.

This is the supply
entrance.
This is where all the
treasure, armor and other
materials are brought up
from the sea.

 OK. 

Out of the way!
Let me do my job!

My job is to watch over
the supplies that pass 
through here. I check
everything.
Isn't it an important
job?
    Yes
    No

Really? Then
out of the way!
Let me do my job!

What!? You're saying
my job ain't important?
Without me...
.....................
.........
A N Y W A Y!! My job is
of extraordinary
magnitude!! Move! 
I gotta do my job!

Man! Just when I
thought I could get all
the treasure from that
excavation out of this
supply entrance...

Darn!
This sucks.
But I'll give this to
you anyway.

 
 Received Super Goggles.

Huh?
What a wimp.

Hmph, you've
had enough for today.

Wait a minute, you want
me to show you?
    Yes
    No

For real?
    Yes
    No

Really really?
    Yes
    No

Hmph, go away.
I'm busy training.

Whaaaaat?
You're a wimp.

Oh alright!
I'll teach you!!

Well then,
en garde!!

This supply
entrance has 4
treasure boxes. 
They're in plain view, but
can you get them all?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1244
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Armor Ground

Supply Entrance

Screw Elevator

What're you runnin'
around for? Don't know
where to go eh?
    Yes
    No

Hmph!
Then get outta here.
I got work to do.

The Reapers are good
from afar but afar from
good. 
It's the biggest mistake
they'll ever make
if they miss with a
beefcake like me.

Doh!! That is
pathetic.
Now listen to me very
carefully, I'm only going
to tell you once.

This is the deck!

This is the entrance to
the screw elevator which
allows you to get to the
bridge.

This is a supply
entrance but it also
serves as a Gear Shop!!

Now you know. Now get
out of here!! G'wan!

Another day on the
job...Submerged under
the sea day to
day......sigh...

Having that job from
the 'Ethos' ruined,
I guess there's no other
way for me to make a
living 'cept diving...
sigh...

Before going in though,
I'll have to do some
warming-up exercises.
Ha, ho, ha, ho...

With my warm up
exercises, I'll be able
to save all the drowning
people. Yeah...
exercise...
Ha, ho, ha, ho...

Fei
"Okay...
Let's go."

Elly
"W-wait..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1246
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Etone? I saw him
earlier but he left.

Margie
"Really? 
Where'd they go?"

I don't know...

Bart
"What're you 
doing Margie?"

Margie
"Hi, Bart. I just heard
from Citan. I also was
looking for that Etone.
This person's seen that
Etone before."

Bart
"Really?"

Hey, quit resistin'!!

Elly
"Bart!!
Look!!"

If you wouldn't resist I
could sell you for more.

Elly
"What are you doing?"

What the?
Who are you?

Instead of the brat
why don't I sell
you off?

Bart
"What! You want some!?
Come get some ya losers!"

You think you're all
that!?

Wha!

What the!?

You!
What're you doing?

Wait,
this guy's...

Oh no...
Jesiah!!

Damn,
I'll remember this!

Bart
"What do you think 
you're doing?"

Jesiah
"Don't move."

Margie
"Wa, wait..."

Jesiah
"Shut up, 
you dog of Solaris."

Elly
"..."

Wait!!

Citan
"A carbine rifle,
that gun technique,
you must be Jesiah.
No Jesiah, you are
misunderstanding.
You always rush into
things. She was only
helping the girl."

Jesiah
"What? 
Butt kissin' talker, is
that you Hyuga..."

Girl
"..."

Jesiah
"Yeh yeah, I know,
Primera.
My misunderstanding."

Jesiah
"Sorry, young lady.
Please, stand up."

Jesiah
"Looks like you were 
just trying to help. That's
what she says.
Sorry about the
misunderstanding. This is
Primera. My daughter.
I am...
Call me Jessie. It's
enough that the little
brats call me Jesiah."

Primera
"..."

Elly
"?"

Jessie
"She says thank you.
Something happened to her
and she hasn't spoken 
since then."

Citan
"...Is this the girl
that brought about your
shotgun wedding?"

Jessie
"That's a damn rude thing
to ask! Look at how old
she is.
Primera is my
second child. That other
kid is already 16."

Citan
"Please excuse me.
How is your wife?"

Jessie
"...She's dead.
I wasn't even there for
her when she died."

Citan
"I see...
What are you doing here?"

Jessie
"I have to go shopping 
sometime.
Besides my son 
has some unsavory
business in this area..."

Ah...
That Etone you were looking
for has just arrived.

Bart
"What!? Where?"

Doctor
"......is the reason why,
so somehow, we need your
help."

Etone
"I see......"

Jessie
"Quit beating 'round the
bush and just help."

Etone
"Fa, father?
And Prim too?"

Jessie
"This is my son Billy."

Billy
"Where have you been until
now?
Things are pretty
serious at the
headquarters."

Jessie
"What do you mean serious?
What's wrong with going
out shopping with my
daughter?"

Billy
"I don't know the details
but you have been labeled as
an undesirable element.
What did you do this time?
Fight? Gamble? 
Go after someone's wife
again!?"

Jessie
"Hmmph, that's just a
rumor about me. A rumor.
Don't you believe that.
Ever since you went into
the 'Ethos' you've become
such a stiff."

Billy
"..."

Jessie
"This lady prevented
Primera from getting
kidnapped.
Why don't you just
help out?"

Elly
"Well...can we get an
introduction to the
'Ethos' then?"

Billy
"Oh yes, please excuse my
rudeness. I didn't know
you saved my sister.
Let me contact the
medical department
at my headquarters.
I have other matters I
must attend to, considering
I am not only a priest but
also an Etone...
So I cannot make any
promises."

Elly
"Then you'll introduce
us?"

Billy
"Yes. Let's stop by the
'Ethos' headquarters
after this."

Margie
"Hmm. A priest and an
Etone at the same time...
Isn't that unsual?
The 'Ethos' is obviously
very different from my
Nisan Sect."

Billy
"Your Nisan Sect? Are
you from Nisan?"

Margie
"Yep, I'm Marguerite. 
Nice to meet you, Father."

Billy
"The pleasure is mine.
I've never had a proper
chance to speak to others
about their religions.
Can we talk later?"

Margie
"Sure, that's fine. 
But I can't take that 
much time. I'm a little 
busy now."

Billy
"Thank you.
Hmm...Marguerite? 
Where have I heard that
name before?"

Bart
"Forget about it,
relax...
I came here to talk
to the 'Ethos'.
Let's get moving."

Billy
"What an impolite fellow.
You should learn how to
speak a little more
politely."

Bart
"Why you!"

Billy
"Well everyone, 
I'll go tell the
'Ethos' headquarters
that you're coming.
When you've taken
care of business here,
please come by the
'Ethos'."

Bart
"I know, I know. 
Let's go." 

Jessie
"Hey Billy, I have 
some business to take 
care of.
If you're going back to 
the headquarters can you
take Primera back to the
brat house for me?"

Billy
"......Alright.
Let's go Prim."

Jessie
"Alright, well I've got
to get going.
Later Hyuga.
I know I'll be seein' you
around."

Citan
"Uh, who knows."

Jessie
"Well, whatever.
See you ladies later."

Citan
"He never changes..."

Citan
"Sigurd said he would be
done with the Yggdrasil
soon."

Bart
"What, really?
Alright, this time we can
really leave port."

Elly
"Are we returning...
to Aveh?"

Bart
"Are you kidding?
We've got to take
care of Fei first.
That smart aleck kid
said he'd introduce
us to the 'Ethos'.
So I guess we'll just
have to go to the 'Ethos'
headquarters then..."

Elly
"...Thank you."

Bart
"Why do I have to get
thanked by you?"

Margie
"Heh, that's right,
Elly."

Elly
"...Yes, you're right."

Who will play?
    <Perso1>
    <Perso2>

Who will play?
    <Perso1>
    <Perso2>
    <Perso3>

One-two

Really quit?
    No
    Yes

Ready? 

Start!

You thought I'd battle
right off? Get real!
Only the fast do well
at this game.
It's a card game for
'men of the sea'.

I'll explain the rules to you.
First I deal you and your
opponent 26 cards each.

Then I will place 4 cards
in front of each player
as your current hands.

And then, I place another
card on the left hand side
looking from your viewpoint.

Up to here I do automatically
for you. But from here on the
game starts.
You must take your first 4
cards and the remaining 21
cards and place them all on
top of the two center cards
faster than your opponent can.
Of course there are certain
rules for placing the cards.

Place a card on top of
another card if it is
numerically in order.
Like one number higher...

In this case, where there
is a 3 you can play a 4.

Or one number lower...

In this case, where there
is a 4 you can play a 3.

But if the numbers
aren't in order...

you can't play the card. But,
if there is a K (13) you can
play an A (1) and vice versa.

Now I'll teach you how
to control the cards.
First...
To move a card from your
deck into an empty position
in the hand of 4 cards in
front of you, use Left and
Right on the Directional
button to pick the position.
Then use either the
<S> button, <T> button,
L1 button, or R1 button
to place the card.

And to play a card, 
move on top of the card
you want to play...

And press the <T> button
or R1 button to play on
the right...

Or press the <S> button
or L1 button to play on
the left.

Of course your opponent 
is also playing cards.

What if neither of you
can play a card, even
after replacing the set of
4 cards in front of you?
In this case there will be a
call of 'one-two', and a card
will be played directly from
your remaining pile of cards.

One-two

If both players still can't
play, this will be repeated.

If there are no remaining
cards on your pile to play
at the 'one-two' call...
then the left-most card from
the set of cards in front of
you will be played directly.

One-two

And...

The first player to use
up all their cards wins.
In this case you lose.

Oh, and one more thing.
By pushing the Select button,
you can quit a game midway
through. But of course this
will mean you lose.

By the way, there are
lots of good players
onboard the Thames.
How about starting off
by playing my mate here?
    Sure
    No thanks

"We've got sonar.
......
That's not it. This
type...It matches with
the Aveh pirate ship,
Yggdrasil."

Dominia
"Yggdrasil?
Wasn't she sunk in 
another battle?"

"There's no record of
its sinking. We were too
busy fighting that red
Gear to try to confirm it."

Dominia
"Then, there is a chance
that it did not sink...
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was the
carrier for that Gear."

"One moment......
Yes, that is correct."

Dominia
"Excellent.
Give me the controls."

"Excellent?
What are you planning on
doing?"

Dominia
"Sink it, of course.
She will never trouble the
Commander again."

"Wait. The Commander's
orders were to investigate
the disappearance of that
flying battleship. 
We can't deviate from 
our mission.
Besides, we are low on
fuel and need to refuel."

Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."

"...Groan... Once you
start, there is no
stopping you is there?
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different than
fighting on land."

Dominia
"Of course. Sorry,
Kelvena."

Bart
"Dammit! I can barely
maneuver and you're movin'
all over the place..."

Fei
"Looks like you're having
a tough fight, Bart."

Bart
"Fei!?
You're alive!?"

Fei
"Hey, that's my line."

Elly
"What about that Gear?"

Dominia
"Elhaym!!
What are you doing
here?"

Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are you here?"

Dominia
"Why? We Gebler need no
special reasons to sink
an enemy ship!
It is our divine duty to
rule those crass land
dwelling Lambs."

Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
us Shepherds, the -Abel- ?"

Dominia
"To me -Lambs- and -Abel-
are the same.
The only definite
differenece is
personal ability.
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is our job.
Look what you've gained
as an Element, Elly.
Why do you even question?
Your superiority
is obvious!"

Elly
"...So the wise harming
the weak is a sign of
ability?
I didn't want that...
That's all!!"

Fei
"Elly,
are you alright?"

Dominia
"That Gear, you're the
one? Hah! So that's how
it is.
How amusing, Elhaym.
All this for a man?
I guess that story was
true after all.
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."

Elly
"Stop!
Don't say another word!"

Dominia
"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, mongrel!?
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"

Elly
"...I will.
If you Gebler
are wise...
then I'd rather
be a fool!!"

Dominia
"Then so be it. Then you
shall be dealt with as
the traitor you are."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1254
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dominia
"Cease your naive
utterances!"

Elly
"I've said nothing wrong!"

Dominia
"I have no intention of
discussing this matter
further with you!
Your traitorous actions
are already apparent!
I will beat you down
right here!!"

Stop it at once.

Miang
"Are you okay?"

Dominia
"Miang!
What are you doing!?
She is a traitor!"

Miang
"Such acts will not be
allowed on a ship under
Ramsus' command...
No matter the reason!
I have examined the
records of the battle
between the Haishao and
Vierge...
From what I can tell,
it was you who attacked
first, wasn't it?
She had no choice but to
defend herself after you
took it upon yourself to
attack without permission.
Above all, you were meant
to be under Kelvena's
command. Were you obeying
Kelvena's orders?"

Dominia
"..."

Miang
"You are not to prosecute
any soldier for treason
without proper authority.
Even if you both are
Elements. Further...
Isn't your attitude toward
the lieutenant, nothing
more than your own
personal prejudice...
Or am I mistaken?"

Dominia
"What!?
I would never..."

Miang
"Thus far, we still cannot
determine whether or not
she is guilty of treason.
To investigate the truth
of this matter further, I
am placing the lieutenant
under my supervision.
Is that clear?"

Dominia
"How dare you!
By what authority!?"

Miang
"Let's go."

Dominia
"...
Wha...what was that?
Those eyes..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1256
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Miang
"...I see...
So that's what was
going on."

Elly
"..."

Miang
"Since I have other
matters to attend to,
would you mind staying
here for awhile?"

Elly
"Not at all."

Miang
"You don't have to worry
about a thing. Leave the
rest to me. 
What you need is to 
recover from your fatigue."

Miang
"Crystalline, blue... 
like the surface of a
lake..."

Elly
"Uh...excuse me?"

Miang
"Your eyes...
They're beautiful."

Elly
"What?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

GO!

!

!!

...

Yah!!

Yes!

Of course!!

Yeah!!

Why doesn't Primera
play with Uncle Stone?
He's sooo interesting...

Ehhh, you're going searching
for the flying saucer?
Take me too!!

Billy
"Davy is watching things
here.
If you're a good boy
you can go sometime."

I, if,  I'm not a 
good boy I can't go...
Waahhh!!

Can't see the flying
saucer today. Aa~h!

Wanna know about the flying
saucer? Then just ask me!
    Tell me
    Nevermind

Ahem!!
Actually it was a long time
ago. About 50 years ago, an
old man, Henry Mingas, said
he was taken by the saucer
and his body was altered.
Well, no one believed him,
but afterward it's said he
had amazing knowledge and
skills he never had before.
Then 10 years ago, strange
circle shaped marks were
found in many places.
You must've heard about it.
No? Well anyway, they were
called mystery circles. So
this guy spread rumors that
they were saucer landing
sites, and when others
began to disappear, there
was even more talk. But
there were other things
than the saucer landing site
explanation, such as the
Naughty Stories, Dragon
Scrolls, or Plasma Legend.
So there was no real proof.
But real disappearances
did happen.

Oh, I forgot to mention,
the saucer was called
'Shevat'.
There are even people
who worship it.

So, was that of any use?
Ahem.

When you say that,
you make me want to
tell you anymore...

You want Billy?
You should go to the 
'Ethos' headquarters.

Yeah!!

Billy's not here so
I gotta work hard.

Billy
"It's just a little while."

It's like something's
in there, but you can't
go inside.
Some kind of haunted
house?
...shiver...

Billy says don't talk
to strangers...

Yeah!!

...eight, nine, ten!!

Where is everyone hiding?

I wonder if Uncle Stone
will come back and play? 

You won't find me again!

Billy plays hide-and-
seek sometimes too.

Hey, where is everyone?
Whisper to me where
they're hiding.

Good children
"Yes!!"

We love Uncle Stone!!

...But if I keep inhaling
such fresh air all the time
then my proboscis may sprout
a hibiscus...
Hmm, what a state.

Why's the air so salty?
Isn't there any fresh air
around here?
If there is I want to
inhale till I'm full.

You want Billy?
You should go to the 
'Ethos' headquarters.

GO!!

Thanks! 
That's a big help!

Thanks! 
I'll pay you back!

Received Tag Badge.

That makes .
Only  left.

Me, I have the day shift
so I have to get all the
chickens in the coop...
Wanna help me?
    OK!!
    That's your job.

Thank you!!
It's easy, the chickens
come when you call them.

Hmmphh, Billy said
the same thing.

You want Billy?
You should go to the
'Ethos' headquarters.

Look out!

Hmm, Uncle Stone is
a bad guy?
Why are you saying
he's strange!

Billy said he respects
Uncle Stone. I guess
I should too.

I'm working out in case
we have a crisis,
so don't bother me.

...

La la la la!

Yeah, great!!

GO!!

...Tee hee hee!

Lu lu lu lu!

GO!!

We're all good friends...

Huh? 'Why aren't you
playing with them?'
Don't be silly...!
I can't play with girls!!

Elly
"Well then, are you
saying I can't play
because I'm a girl?"

You're okay!

Hey hey 
get on this!

Don't talk to strangers!

!!

Wow!!
Uncle Stone!!

Uncle Stone
"Hello,
are you all happy?

Bishop Stone!!

Bishop Stone
"Oh, Billy my son!"

Billy
"Sorry to bother you
when you're busy".

Bishop Stone
"And who are these people?"

Billy 
"They are travelers from
another country."

Bishop Stone
"Oh...
By the way, about your
earlier message..."

Billy
"Yes, 
about work..."

Bishop Stone
"Yes.
The 'Ethos' transport ship
that went missing finally
turned up. 
But, there's no reply..."

Billy
"What does it mean?"

Bishop Stone
"Hmmm,
perhaps Reapers again.
Billy can you do 
the usual?"

Billy
"Right,
no problem. 
Leave it to me, Bishop."

Bishop Stone
"Thanks.
It's to the northeast
from here.
Please be careful.
It's a dangerous area.
There are some pretty
fast sea currents and
it's best to stay away
from the Salvagers.
You'd better go in
a big ship..."

Bart
"Hey, is that the massive
ship Sig was talking
about earlier?"

Billy
"I don't know if that
was it or not."

Bart
"From what I hear, it's a
place where the currents
are really fast.
It's supposedly very
dangerous for small ships.
But the Yggdrasil will be
safe there.
No matter how big the wave
or swell, it's no problem.
Besides, we have help from
Fei.
Let's get aboard.
I'll see you off to there.
What, we could even help
you finish your job!"

Elly
"I agree. You saved Fei.
It's the least we could
do."

Billy
"Thanks but this doesn't
involve you.
Just me is enough."

Elly
"But isn't that place 
dangerous?
If there is anything 
we can do to help..."

Billy
"I don't want to get 
you involved..."

Bishop Stone
"Billy, my son, don't waste
their good intentions.
That sub is theirs, no?
Why don't you cooperate
with them..."

Billy
"...
But, Bishop!"

Bart
"Yeah, it's no fun
to travel alone.
Let's help."

Elly
"Billy, it's best to
go with friends!"

Billy
"...
Well if you insist.
Thank you.
I appreciate it."

Bishop Stone
"I thank you deeply.
Billy, take care
of these people.
Report back to headquarters
after you get back."

Billy
"Yes, Bishop."

Billy
"Thank you.
Let's see what tomorrow
brings.
I'll come as soon as I'm
finished preparing for
tomorrow. Go on ahead.
I'll tell you more on
the way there..."

Citan
"Why hello!"

Billy
"Oh, how are you?
How is Fei doing?"

Elly
"Very well.
He hasn't regained 
consciousness yet, but he
should come around soon."

Billy
"Really? 
That's good to hear."

Elly
"Um, Billy. 
I don't know quite how to
thank you for helping Fei." 

Billy
"Don't mention it.
We may believe in 
different gods, but
none of us can leave
people in need."

Elly
"Thank you very much. 
By the way is this 
your orphanage...?"

Billy
"Surprised there are 
only children?"

Billy
"My sister and I haven't
had parents since we were
infants... 
So I opened an orphange
so kids without anyone
wouldn't have to go 
through what we did."

Billy
"They're all healthy and
obedient to the teachings
of the 'Ethos'.
They're all good kids who
even help me with work."

Later!!

Hey, you didn't 
find me, that's no fun!

You want some candy?
    Yah, gimme some
    Nah

Ya~ay!
Let's empty this bottle
quick so we can put 
pretty shells in it!

Aw gee... I wanted to
hurry up and empty this
bottle so we could put
pretty shells in it!

By the way...
don't tell Brother B!

Ah, you scared me. 
I thought you were
Brother B...
It's a secret, okay?
    OK
    I don't know

Ya~ay! Thanks. 
I'll give you this book
if you keep it a secret,
'kay?

Received a fun 
picture book!

You're a meanie! 
Go away!

There's a string...
    Pull it!!
    Don't

Sigurd
"Bart!!
Yggdrasil's radar picked up
an image of a huge ship!!"

Sigurd
"Hyuga!
Yggdrasil's radar picked up
an image of a huge ship!!"

Bart
"What? 
Gebler again?"

Sigurd
"I don't know but it's
moving at 10 repsol/hr
to the south.
Let's head to the bridge."

Bart
"Got it!
Be right there."

Citan
"Gebler again?"

Sigurd
"I don't know but it's 
moving at 10 repsol/hr
to the south.
Let's head to the bridge."

Citan
"Understood. 
I will be there shortly."

Hey you, in the black 
and white. 
Are you Sigurd?

Sigurd
"Is that any way to speak
to someone?
Who do you think you are?"

Citan
"Ah... He may not look
it but he is our senior."

Citan
"Ah...He may not look 
it but he is our senior."

Sigurd
"Senior?
Jessie?"

Billy
"Siggy?"

Bart
"He said Siggy?"

Jessie
"A silver haired man
with amber skin.
I'd say that's rare.
What are you all doing 
here?"

Citan
"It just sort of happened."

Citan
"It just sort of happened."

Sigurd
"A lot's happened..."

Jessie
"Well, let's talk about 
things over some drinks.
So...
Why are you all here?"

Billy
"Siggy,
it's been a long time...
What's with the eye patch?"

Sigurd
"Billy...
you've grown up.
With that smile you look 
just like Racquel."

Bart
"Hey!
Hey hey hey!
Who are you? 
Get all cozy with my 
officers, huh?
And what's all this
'Siggy' stuff? 
Don't get cute, kid!"

Billy
"What's with you?
Why are you so
arrogant to Siggy?
Who do you think
you are?"

Jessie
"Billy. 
Don't yell at
Sigurd's people.
It's bad form, boy."

Sigurd
"Bart, this was my senior
when I was a candidate 
for Elements in Jugend.
I rented a room in his 
house."

Jessie
"Back then he was still
in diapers...
and he's still a whiny
little brat now."

Billy
"You're probably still
in diapers, aren't you?"

Bart
"You punk!
What's your problem?"

Jessie
"Well...then, shall
we go straight off and
drink ourselves under?"

Sigurd
"Where do you plan
on going...?"

Jessie
"What do you mean?
There has to be a bar or
two on board your ship!"

Sigurd
"I have a slight 
headache..."

Jessie
"What?
That's OK.
We'll get rid of that
headache with a good
drink."

Citan
"What are you going to do?"

Citan
"What are you going to do?"

Sigurd
"I can't just say no to
him..."

Jessie
"What are you doin'? 
Let's go!"

Sigurd
"Hey now..."

Oh-no-ho-ho...

Oh-no-ho-ho...

Billy
"I'm not going...
Go ahead and have a good
time."

Bart
"What's this huge ship 
Sig was talking about?"

Elly
"What is this huge ship 
Sig was talking about?"

Citan
"I am sorry, everyone. 
If I may be excused..."

Rico
"Oh well, I guess I'll go.
I've got time to kill."

Bart
"Oh well, me too."

Rico
"Oh well, I guess I'll go.
I've got time to kill."

Bart
"Oh well, me too."

Jessie
"...HIC...!!
I'm back. 
Where's Billy?"

Billy
"Keep it down!
What time do you think
it is?
Be quiet when you come
back, or you will wake
the children."

Jessie
"If you'd come you'd
have heard a ton of
good stories.
Sigurd's stories 
were hilarious."

Billy
"You know Siggy doesn't
drink and you made him?
Even though you're a holy
man's father..."

Jessie
"Hey hey, why don't you
open up your eyes.
You need to quit bein'
a priest."

Billy
"I don't want to hear
that from someone with-
out a shred of faith.
Stay out of my life."

Jessie
"Stay out?
Do you have any idea how
much trouble your little
butt is in?"

Billy
"What?
How would you know?"

Jessie
"!?
You...!!"

Billy
"I still don't believe
you're even my father.
You're not the person
mother loved."

Jessie
"Whaddya mean...
You think I'm a fake?"

Billy 
"Ask yourself."

...

Jessie
"You're right. I guess
there's no way to prove
it...
Fine, you still don't
understand the truth.
What those guys really are, 
where you are going..."

Billy
"Father, what are 
you saying...?"

Jessie
"I'm saying Racquel died
in vain."

Billy
"!!
You have no right to
say mother's name!"

Jessie
"...
I see. That's the way it
is. Fine.
Anyhow, quit your job. 
Consider it a piece of
advice from a man who is
but a stranger to you."

Primera
"..."

Primera
"..."

I can cheer myself up!!

Dad's bell makes such
a pretty sound!

Sounds good, huh?
My Dad gave me this bell
so I would never get lost.
But my dad has no sense of
direction and gets lost a
lot too! So he also has
the same kind of bell.
He went to the 'Ethos'
headquarters but never
came back...
He must have gotten lost
on the way...
He's so silly!

What? 
That bell...
How did you get that?
Hey, you didn't happen
to meet my dad, did you?
Where is he?

Rico
"..."

(Oh-no! 
That wasn't...
his father...!?)

Rico
"Listen son! Your father's
gone to a faraway place...
Here, this is his bell!"

My father's a liar!!
He said we would go away
and live by ourselves...
just the two of us...
I've waited...so long...
Oh, Daddy...why?
Boo-hoo-hoo!

Sob, sob...
But...thanks.
Thanks for bringing  
Dad's bell back.
It'll cheer me up...!!

As thanks I'll give you
my dad's favorite book.

Billy
"Excuse me, I must go and

Please don't go searching

Hey, you're going
to the 'Hideout for 
skinful termites'?

Zephyr will eat 
you up...!

Hey, read me this book...
    Alright!
    Maybe next time!

Ye~y!!

<Perso1>
"Long, long ago there was
a woman named Zephyr. 
She wanted to be a god
so she built a tower that
reached up to heaven.
Then she built a city at
the top. But god got mad
and destroyed her tower.
So she then had to live
in a 'hideout for sinful
hermits'.
After that she never 
returned to the earth
again... The end."

Is there really a
'Hideout for
skinful termites'?
It sounds scary!

You made a promise now!
If you don't read it to me
next time then that's a lie!
And if you lie, you have to
stick a needle in your eye!

Shhh!

Billy's come out from 
behind the book shelves!

Really? 
He sure does some
weird things...

!

Don't eavesdrop!!

Boys are such monsters.

Yes.
They're so stuck up.

!

Don't eavesdrop!!

Will Uncle Stone ever
come back...?

The start of my
youth...

Don't listen!!

Isn't Bobby cool?

Yeah, and that cool
jump! You know he runs
everyday...

Don't listen!!

This bed's so fluffy!! 
Ya wanna fluff it?
    I wanna fluff
    No thanks

Go ahead

It's so fluffy!!

Wait a minute.

There wasn't any paper so
I used this book. 
Did you wanna use it?

Received an 'Old Comic Book'.

I said, 'Toilet taken!'!

Toilet taken!

Take your time.

How old was I...?
I don't remember.
Maybe 8 or 9. 
About then,
dad taught me
how to use a gun.

One day
dad disappeared.

He just ran out on us.

He never came back.

Even so,
I stayed in his room alone
often.
Dad's gun, 
Dad's smell.
Those things were all
I had left to
remind me of him.

But that happiness 
didn't last long...

When I was 12,
my house was attacked
by Reapers
and mom was killed.
They were looking for dad
but mom wouldn't talk.

I can still hear it... 
The sound of the bullets
slowly firing three times...
I even remember the sound
of the empty shells
hitting the floor.
After that,
the Reapers screamed
and I heard someone fall.

Bishop Stone was the one 
who helped us then.
Meeting him changed my life
from then on.

Bart
"Hey, hey, wait a sec. 
Do Reapers talk?"

Citan
"Wait a minute. 
Reapers spoke in a human
language?"

"Yes.
They're not just monsters.
Some of them are more
intelligent than humans."

Primera and I hid in the
shadows escaping death,
but she hasn't spoken a
word since. 

Like a godsend, kind,
strong Bishop Stone gave
me an example to follow.
I wanted to help save
someone in need like
he saved us.
I didn't want there to
be any more children
like Primera...
So I began training at the
'Ethos' to become just
like Bishop Stone.

I left Prim in the care
of the 'Ethos' and
entered the monastery.

Many years passed...

I finished training
at the monastery and
became an Etone.

I returned home to
open the orphange...

And he...had
unexpectedly come back.

But he was different.
Some terrible accident
changed him. 
Not only his looks, but
his character and manner
had entirely changed too.
I remembered him as a
quiet man...

But... more than that,
I thought maybe I didn't 
really remember him...

That's why...
I can never think of him
as a father...

But Prim needed a father, 
and she'd become attached
to him.
Deep in my heart, I too
thought I wanted a father.

But...
even now I just can't 
believe he is my real 
father.

Stone
"4 years ago...
After searching to the ends
of the earth, no trace of
him could be found."

Stone
"Racquel, dirtied by
him...
and the reminder of that
taint...you and
your sister..."

Stone
"Through Krelian's wisdom,
using the Wels, I saved
Racquel from misery..."

Elly
"What? 
There's something..."

Elly
"Billy, who's 'buddy'?"

Elly
"There's nothing there.
Don't scare me. It's just
fish jumping around.
But the sea is great.
The breeze is so cool...
So different from the
desert!!"

Elly
"!! 
Didn't you just say we
couldn't stand a chance
against it by ourselves?"

Citan
"Huh? 
Something behind..."

Citan
"Billy...who is 'buddy'?

Citan
"There is nothing there.
Just fish jumping around.
Ahh...the sea. The cool
breeze...so different from
the desert!!"

Citan
"!!
You did say that we would
not stand much of a chance
against it by ourselves?"

Bart
"Huh? 
Something there...?"

Bart
"Yo Billy, what's 'buddy'?"

Bart
"There's nothing there but
some fish jumping around.
I love the sea. The cool
breeze...so different from
the desert. From now on
I'm a man of the sea."

Bart
"Hey!
What now? Didn't you just
say that we wouldn't stand
a chance against that by
ourselves?"

Rico
"What's that...?"

Rico
"Hey Billy, who's buddy?"

Rico
"Huh? It's just a fish.
Aah, I love the sea.
The breeze is so cool...
Nothing like Kislev."

Rico
"Hey!
What now? Didn't you just
say that we wouldn't stand
a chance against that by
ourselves?"

Billy
"Just as I thought. This
transport's infested.
I must go to the
'Ethos' and tell
Bishop Stone..."

Billy
"...Hmm, it's probably
its brethren. A giant
Wels.
An entity we wouldn't stand
much of a chance against by
ourselves. But don't worry,
they're pretty slow.
Even if that Wels called
it, it probably won't
reach us in time.
But I called for my Gear
anyway just to be safe."

Billy
"......
Faster than I expected.
Well, here it comes."

Billy
"It should be any 
time now."

Billy
"Great timing on the part
of the kids. I owe them
one.
Well, get ready cause here
it come."

Billy
"Looks like blood ......
What happened on this 
transport...
No wait, this is...
water with rust in it.
Let's hurry on ahead." 

It's unlocked but the 
door is rusted shut.
Maybe if you ran into it?

Maybe if you ran into it?

Unlock it?
    Yes
    Hold on a second

It's rusted shut!!

It's rusted...
but it rattles a little.

It's locked

Elly
"It's dark..."

Elly
"What's that weird smell?"

Elly
"Scared?"

Elly
"Wels?
By the way Billy, do
you have any equipment?"

Elly
"You mean you don't fight
physically? How strange."

Citan
"It is dark..."

Citan
"What is that odor?"

Citan
"Is it scary?"

Citan
"Wels?
Billy are you equipped
for this?"

Citan
"You say you do not fight
physically? How rare."

Bart
"It's dark..."

Bart
"Woo, something stinks..."

Bart
"Scared?"

Bart
"Wels?
So Billy, do you
have equipment?"

Bart
"You don't fight hand to
hand? You're a rare one."

Rico
"It's dark..."

Rico
"What's that nasty smell?"

Rico
"Scared?"

Rico
"Wels?
Hey, Billy do you
have equipment?"

Rico
"You don't fight with your
fists? That's rare."

Light on.
Opened door-lock A.

Billy
"Shall we return
to Yggdrasil?"
    Go back
    Stay

A locked.

Billy
"This unusual smell is
that of the Wels.
It sure looks like 
they attacked..."

Billy
"One more thing.
On the room's middle
wall is a red switch.
Push the switch to turn
on the lights."

Billy
"...
No...
Just a little."

The door won't open.

Fei
"Can't we go into 
the cathedral?"

Elly
"Can't we go into 
the cathedral?"

Elly
"It's no use...
He can't survive
with those wounds."

Elly
"It's possible
with him."

Citan
"Are we not allowed
inside the cathedral?"

Citan
"...Unfortunately,
he passed away."

Citan
"It is possible with him."

Bart
"Can't we go into 
the cathedral?"

Bart
"Forget it.
He's dead."

Bart
"It's possible with him."

Billy
"T, this is...!
What, what happened here?"

Billy
"Are you alright?
What happened?"

Billy
"Hey, hang in there!
Hey!"

Billy
"Why...
Why did this happen?
............
...This is...?"

Billy
"This is father's
shell casing...
Dammit... Don't tell
me he stormed into the
'Ethos' headquarters
in desperation?"

Rico
"Guess we can't get in 
the cathedral."

Rico
"I guess it's too late."

Rico
"I can't deny that."

Billy
"The infirmary is this way.
Let's go."

Billy
"We have been waiting
for you.
I received permission
to treat Fei so long as
it is in the practice
hall's infirmary.
Let us 'Ethos' staff
take care of the rest."

Elly
"Please,
take care of Fei for me..."

Billy
"The brothers from the
'Ethos' are looking after
Fei in the infirmary.
Let me take you there.
Please follow me,
this way."

Billy
"This way."

Billy
"..."

Billy
"We are father and son in
blood only! I have nothing
to do with that man..."

Billy
"...That father of mine...
I wish he'd think about my
position before acting."

Verlaine
"Billy, I hear your
father has been
rather active again."

Verlaine
"It is said that there was
an attack on an excavation
site which injured many of
my 'brothers' and workers."

Verlaine
"Well, you're such a fine
Etone - destroying Reapers
and proving the justice of
the 'Ethos' to the world.
But your father is..."

Verlaine
"Don't get me wrong.
I don't suspect you,
our good 'brother'.
I just wanted to
inform you about
your father."

This is a practice hall.
This facility was built 
for us Etone.

No.
Only 'Ethos' members or
those with known identities
can enter the cathedral
and its related facilities.
The same thing applies to
this practice hall, but the
bishop made an exception
for brother Billy.

B, Billy...

I don't know......
Suddenly, I heard a gun shot......

True faith comes from
a stern doctrine.

The peace and order here
in Aquvy is getting worse
day by day.
Saving people who have
nowhere else to turn...
This too is a duty of
the 'Ethos'.

Many people visit the 
'Ethos' to get help.
...They're the same as 
us Etone.
We also came to the
'Ethos' with hearts 
filled with sorrow.

The 'Ethos' was created
to save people--
to save people's souls and
revive lost technology.
We wish happiness to all
the people of the world.

I used to live in Aveh,
but I lost my house in
the war with Kislev.
The 'Ethos' accepted
me as a believer.
This is my home now.

Reapers destroyed my
village...
I'll become an Etone
and create a world with
no hardships!

Da--dd--y.
Where did mommy go?

We don't know Fei's 
condition yet.
... Let's stay here
a little longer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1286
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Billy
"What's going on...
The Etone are in charge
of the 'Ethos' military
but they've been killed
without signs of struggle."

Reapers are humans turned
into things by god to pay
for their crimes.
They're sealed in the
cursed land of the heavens,
Shevat.

People belonging to the 
'Ethos' must act modestly
with generosity.
To do that we often read
from the sacred scripts
to return to a purer soul.

This room was prepared 
for people who have no 
one to turn to.
We hope to save their 
souls and give them hope
to live.

They say Babel Tower is 
connected to Shevat. The 
exit is under close watch 
by our people.
In spite of that, 
cursed Reapers continue to 
appear in this land.
That's why the Etone are 
here to eliminate them.

We, the Etone, are the
swords and shields of the
'Ethos' so to speak.
We fight with enemies
such as Reapers
and thieves to save 
people with faith in god.

Billy!Does your dad
hold a grudge against
the 'Ethos'?
They say the 'Ethos'
supply dump was bombed
again.

Aha! You!
Ask Billy if his dad holds
a grudge against the 
'Ethos' or not.
They say his father bombed
the 'Ethos' supply dump.
Oh, my head hurts.

Plundered by war and
salvagers... Destruction
by the Reapers...
We must meet the people's
expectations toward the 
'Ethos'.

Why does Jessie attack
the 'Ethos' buildings?
I heard he was once an
amazing Etone...

What's happening?
I'm scared.

Mom...

What happened to the man
from the 'Ethos'?
He hasn't been back since
he left the room earlier.

Um...someone from the
'Ethos' got in a huge
Gear and saved me.
Some man named master
attacked us...It was
very frightening.

What's going on outside?
Suddenly, men in black 
stormed in here.
Etones are fighting back
for us now...

Please tell me, young man.
Can't you have happiness
without sacrifice?
Can't you go through life
without misery...?

Everyone...
Everyone died.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1288
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Verlaine
"Hahahm, Billy.
How is your
beloved father?"

Verlaine
"...I have no business with
people not associated with
the 'Ethos'."

This is the Pontiff's
room. The general public
is not allowed in here.
Please leave.

This is the Pontiff's
room. The general public
is not allowed in here.
Please leave.

The Bishop's been worried
about Reapers, refugees,
Etone, the faith...

("...Too many Wels are out 
there now. More than we 
can handle...
What are 'they'
thinking?")

Purge! Purge...!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1294
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Billy
"Bishop!
Are you alright?"

Billy
"God's judgement?
What do you mean,
Bishop?"

Billy
"He's gone.
What was he trying to tell
me? Purge, I wonder
what he meant?"

Billy
"Something's over there.
It's impossible to get
through here like this."

O, oh... Billy...
You're safe...
...The purge...
has begun...
We sinners...have brought
god's judgement on mankind...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"He said survivor, didn't 
he? That means, people 
from the 'Ethos' are..."

Elly
"Come on, Billy.
There have to be survivors.
Let's help them."

Elly
"Yes...
It looks like he is
going to be alright."

Citan
"Elly, how is Fei doing?"

Citan
"I see. Then, let us
go to the infirmary."

Citan
"Are the people from the 
'Ethos' alright? They 
mentioned survivors but..."

Citan
"Billy, pull yourself
together.
There must be people
who could not escape.
Let us go help them."

Citan
"Elly, how is Fei's 
condition?"

Citan
"I see.
Then, let us go
to the infirmary."

Citan
"Are the people from the 
'Ethos' alright? They 
mentioned survivors but..."

Citan
"Billy, pull yourself 
together.
There must be people who 
could not escape.
Let us go help them."

Bart
"Elly, did Fei get 
medical treatment?"

Bart
"Come on.
Let's go to the infirmary."

Bart
"Watch out, Billy.
These guys are 
professional assassins."

Bart
"Hey, Billy, come on!
We're gonna help the
survivors. Let's go!"

Billy
"Don't move!
Who are you?"

Billy
"Who...
are these guys?
Why're they attacking
the 'Ethos'?"

Billy
"What!
Then, everyone..."

Rico
"Looks like they finished
patching up Fei."

Rico
"Then, let's go to
the infirmary."

Rico
"They're pros.
Real killers."

Rico
"Come on.
We've gotta go save
the survivors."

Billy
"This way."

Billy
"The infirmary is this way.
Let's go."

Billy
"Let's hurry to the sick 
bay. This way, please."

There are still survivors?

Wagggh!

Billy
"<Perso1>, the infirmary
is not that way.
It's this way."

Billy
"That's the wrong way.
Take these steps."

Billy
"That's the confession room.
If you have a problem, we 
can discuss it later."

Billy
"That's the library.
Right now isn't it more 
important to visit Fei?"

Billy
"That's the cafeteria.
...Are you hungry?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1300
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Billy
What's going on?
Are these guys in black
gonna kill all of us who
are with the 'Ethos'?

You're Etone!
All that awaits those with
the 'Ethos' is death!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1302
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Billy, we got beat. They
just attacked suddenly...

Heh, heh, heh.
Here comes our prey.

Heh, heh, heh.
Kill it!!

Heh, heh, heh.
This could be fun!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1304
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Billy
"...No good.
He has passed away."

Uggghh......

There are tons of books
collected by the 'Ethos'
stored in this library.
It's a real treasure
house of information.

Do you know about the huge
tower called Babel Tower?
They say it's built by
people who tried to reach
a god in the sky.
According to tradition, god
became angry with their
disrespect and his thunder
destroyed the tower.

People who built Babel
Tower were so afraid of
god's revenge they ran
away to the sky.
That place is Shevat, the
'house of sinning hermits'.

I've been assigned to
go to the excavation
site in Dazil.
I'm to review the
technical information
of the ruins once again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1308
----------------------------------------------------------------------

...wah, wah...
Suddenly some men in black
came and killed everyone.
I hurried and hid, so they
didn't find me...

...wah, wah...
Everyone was killed.
They killed them all.

Ah, busy, busy.
Many more refugees came.
We need to feed them well
to cheer them up!!

Elly
"Um...Where is Billy?
I'd like to thank him..."

Citan
"Then..."

Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.
More importantly,
you saved Fei.
Fei could not have
been protected from
Kahr without you.
Is that not correct?"

Citan
"Well, we do not want to 
disturb his recovery.
So, shall we go now?
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."

Citan
"I agree.
Fei will feel at ease
that way. Please let us
know when you finish
treating Fei.
We will leave the rest
up to you."

Citan
"Did Fei regain 
consciousness?"

Citan
"I am sorry to have
bothered you."

Citan
"We are in Billy's debt.
We should go thank him."

Citan
"First of all, let us move
Fei to the Yggdrasil.
It will not be too late to
go see Billy afterwards."

Citan
"Then..."

Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.
More importantly,
you saved Fei.
Fei could not have
been protected from
Kahr without you.
Is that not correct?"

Citan
"Well, we do not want to

We should go thank him."

Citan
"First of all, let us move
Fei to the Yggdrasil.
It will not be too late to
go see Billy afterwards."

Bart
"That means..."

Bart
"Elly, that's not true.
You can't resist being
hypnotized. You don't
need to feel guilty.
More importantly, you
saved Fei. You
protected him from
Ramsus.
Isn't that right?"

Bart
"Hey, we don't want to 
disturb his recovery.
Let's take a little walk.
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."

Bart
"Yeah, why don't you do 
that. I'm sure Fei'll be 
happy. 
Well, call us when you're 
done with Fei. I'll leave 
the rest to you."

Bart
"By the way, did Fei
regain consciousness?"

Bart
"Thanks a lot!"

Bart
"Billy really helped
us a lot. We'd better
thank him for that."

Bart
"First, let's take Fei to 
the Yggdrasil. We can go 
thank him afterwards."

Rico
"Hmm, then..."

Rico
"At the time, you were
hypnotized. You couldn't
help it. Don't feel guilty.
He could've been killed
by Ramsus if you weren't 
there then."

Rico
"It may take a little
longer to finish his
treatment. Let's go
somewhere to kill time."

Rico
"Do what you need to do.
Let me know when you're 
finished with Fei."

Rico
"Is Fei better?"

Rico
"You must've put in 
a lot of time."

Rico
"...I want to thank Billy
at least."

Rico
"First of all, let's take
Fei to the Yggdrasil.
And we can go from there."

Elly
"Even if it was impossible 
to resist, the reason why 
I was hypnotized was 
because I was off my guard.
I'm partly responsible for
what happened.
So I'd like to be by his
side till he's awake."

Elly
"Fei...
I'm sorry."

Elly
"...Will Fei ever 
regain consciousness?"

Elly
"...I'm sorry, Fei.
I caused the engine room
to lose control..."

Elly
"Thank you..."

Elly
"I...would like to
stay a little while.
Is it okay?"

Billy
"How is he?"

Billy
"All we can do is 
wait and see."

He is in stable condition.
His treatment is almost 
complete.

W, what's happening?
Those men in black are
killing the 'Ethos'
people indiscriminately!

You seem to be better.
I'm glad. I'm really glad.

Has he recovered?
His treatment was a 
success, so there's no 
need to worry.

The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,
but we see no abnormality
with his brain.
The low water temperature
lowered his metabolism and
saved him.
One false step and he
could've suffered from
brain death.

Yes, don't worry.
However, we need to conduct
more tests for a while.
After that, he can be
treated at your medical
facilities.

The reason why he hasn't
regained consciousness is
physical exhaustion.
He overworked himself. 
It'll probably take him a
few more days, but don't
worry, he'll wake up.

Please, don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.

Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.

Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't regained
consciousness yet. But
there's no need to worry.
When he recovers physically,
he'll also regain
consciousness. You can
take him to your ship now.

Please don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.

Oh yes, brother Billy...
He went back to the
orphanage.
He was worried about the
children left behind.

Who are you all!?"

Pontiff

"Ghaaaaaaa!!"

You're still pretending
you don't know anything?

Rebelling against us will
cost you your life.

You may be the leader of
the 'Ethos', but you don't
know when you're beaten.

Elly
"An inquisitor?"

Citan
"Inquisitor?"

Bart
"The inquisitor?"

Billy
...... I......
still can't believe it.
The 'Ethos' was that
dubious an organization...
What was it that I believed
in... all this time?"

Billy
"V... Verlaine!?"

Billy
"Father!
How could you do that!?"

Billy
"That symbol...!"

Billy
"You claim Verlaine and his
men are an assassination
unit for the Bishop!?
How could you even say
such blasphemy!?"

Billy
"Is that true, Verlaine?
But why people from
the 'Ethos'?"

Billy
"Even if that were true,
we have no right to punish
others!
Judgement belongs to god.
That is what we were
taught, wasn't it!?"

Billy
"I...I have been
passing judgement?"

Billy
"Verlaine!
Hang in there!"

Billy
"Verlaine!
Verlaine!"

Billy
"Bishop! Why Verlaine!?
What in heavens are you
trying to accomplish!?"

Billy
"Father!"

"Bishop Stone!"

"Inquisitor, you say?"

Billy
"The door is locked!"

Verlaine
"Y, you ......"

Jessie
"What are you getting
flustered about, boy?
It was a stun bullet.
He's just taking a nap.
You should've been able to
tell by the sound it made!
Besides, these murderers
are not from the 'Ethos'!"

Jessie
"Look!"

Jessie
"Yes, that's right.
They're agents of Solaris!
Probably an assassination
unit under Stone's command!
I got word that they were
exterminating all 'Ethos'
members, and hurried here.
But I was too late...
All 'Ethos' affiliates
have already been killed,
except for those on some
sort of salvage mission."

Jessie
"I won't let you go
that easily, Stein!!"

Jessie
"Stein, you aren't
goin' anywhere!!"

Are you trying to take away my
ultimate pleasure, Verlaine?

Verlaine
"Gha-ha!!"

Verlaine
"Ugh!"

Stone
"A good-for-nothing
chatterbox such as you
has no right to live."

Stone
"I am the inquisitor sent
to Earth from Solaris."

Stone
"The status of bishop
is merely a convenience
for my activities on Earth.
The 'Ethos' was created as
a Solaris sub-organization
and given the task of
managing earth-dwellers.
But over the years the
'Ethos' started to set
up convenient doctrines
for itself...
It then went on to gather
the ignorant masses, and
created a god for them to
believe in.
Then, the 'Ethos' even
went so far as to plot
a separation from its
creator, Solaris.
So Solaris had no choice
but to eliminate all those
who defy our rule and raise
the flag of rebellion.
The ones prepared as
'eliminators' were...
the Etone.
Etones, 'the Atoners', the
organization I established
within  the 'Ethos', had
two purposes...
On the surface their aim
was to eliminate the
'Reapers' or -Wels- that
run rampant on the earth.
But, that's not their only
purpose. Behind the scenes,
we also had selected men
like Verlaine...
These were responsible for
observing and eliminating
any corrupt people who
appeared in the 'Ethos'.
You didn't have the chance
to learn of this, since you
left the 'Ethos' so early.
...Or actually,
I just never told you.
There was 'another role'
I wanted you to perform!"

Billy
"Another...role!?"

Stone
"Billy. There are certain
things in this world that
you're happier not knowing.
Even lies and deceptions
can become the truth for
some people of the earth.
...Particularly those not
knowing the true nature
of things, or how these
systems of things works.
In fact, the -god- and
-faith- systems set up by
the 'Ethos' were the truth
itself, were they not?"

Billy
"Tell me!
What other 'role' were
you talking about?
What did Verlaine
mean when he spoke
of 'judgement'!?"

Stone
"So you want to know?
But can you bear the full
weight of the truth?
Billy, if you can bear
that weight, then I'm
willing to tell you."

Billy
"..."

Stone
"You believed that you
were saving wandering
souls, didn't you...?
That's why you carried
out your cleansing of
the 'Reapers' -Wels-
from the earth, right?
In fact it was all just
another control system
put in place by Solaris.
But what's more, your
'saving' work...that very
activity you believed in so
much, was in reality..."

Jessie
"You're talking too
much nonsense!"

Jessie
"You haven't changed
at all since then...
have you, Stein!?"

Billy
"Stein?"

Stone
"That's a name I haven't
been called for a long
time...
Hearing that name vividly
brings back a pleasant
twinge of pain to the
'scars on this body'.
You know what I mean,
Jesiah?"

Jessie
"Heh, your brain still
isn't working right.
Answer me!
Why do you have such
'a roundabout way
of doing things'!?"

Stone
"That's not worth
wasting my breath
answering...
Just consider it
'my reward in life'...
Of course, that includes
watching your agonizing
death.
I could succumb to the 
desire to slice up your 
body here and now, and
drag out your innards...
But I can't do that now,
I have a matter to attend
to elsewhere.
That 'duty' comes before
any pleasure I could have
with you here. I haven't
the time to waste anymore!"

Stone
"I can't be bothered by
insignificant wretches
like you."

Stone
"Until next time! And, as
a parting gift, I'll have
these men entertain you!"

Stone
"Well then, excuse me.
Oh and Billy! If you have
something you wish to
discuss, come see me later.
I'll be waiting for you."

Isn't that the very reason
why I told you back then...
that you belong with us...?

Verlaine
"You're defiled, Billy.
You left the 'Ethos' and
kept company with dregs
who have no faith at all.
And you lost sight of what
it means to be defiled.
I didn't expect it out of
you... You who used to
live only for your faith.
You should have remained
like us.
But fear not, Billy.
I shall cleanse you.
You'll live within me.
You will become one with
me in death...

Verlaine
"What!?"

Verlaine
"That's right...
We are servants
of the Bishop.
Our mission is to hand out
judgement on fallen priests
and sinners in order to
make them repent."

Verlaine
"The pontiff and his
brethren deserve to die!
They allowed greed to tempt
them into abandoning their
'duties as the 'Ethos'' to
pursue world domination.
They passed their own death
sentences when they allowed
such desires to overtake
them.
And that's not all.
Saving orphans and
refugees...
that may seem like
works of mercy.
But the little boys and
girls kept here were
actually used as a means
to satisfy the desires of
the pontiff and bishops.
Indulging in selfish
desires...
This is not 'conduct
befitting priests'!
Such defiled leaven have
no right to speak for god.
That is why we set out on
this purification work.
They must atone for
their sins.
These are the
Bishop's orders!"

Verlaine
"God?
Where does such
a being exist?
You should know by now how
the 'Ethos' came about...
It was an organization
created by Solaris aeons
ago solely for the purpose
of managing ignorant humans.
Its doctrines are just
deceptions designed to
control the masses.
The 'Ethos' used the two
sweet fruits of 'faith'
and 'technology' well to
skillfully manipulate global
affairs and people's zeal.
Thus, they manipulated the
ignorant masses to
repeatedly continue their
pointless wars.
Eventually, battle data on
'man' and 'weapons' gleaned
from these wars, were sent
to Solaris itself...
And analyzed to aid in 
ruling the entire Earth.
These intentionally
perpetuated wars caused
much phychological discord.
But faith in 'god'...
salvation...
was used as a cushion
to soften the blow.
It was a well thought-
out system.
But the choice of managers
was extremely poor.
Or did you think that acting
the part of a faithful
servant of god would
someday yield an answer
from a great god somewhere?
Can't you see that such
a divine being just 'never
existed from the beginning'?
And you don't seem to
realize this, but you
yourself were 'passing
judgement on sinners'
as much as we were!"

Verlaine
"That's right.
Daily you have been
dirtying your hands
as an accomplice..."

Verlaine
"Bi...lly......"

Elly
"No mistake!
This has to be the
'Ethos' data bank!"

Elly
"...Wait a minute!
...This is Solaris'
equipment!"

Elly
"Don't be so surprised!
No matter how vast this
world is, such advanced
equipment as this could
only come from Solaris."

Elly
"Look, here! 
The destinations of all
resources collected by
the 'Ethos' through
trade with each area...
All the resources are
being sent on to the
Solaris homeland."

Elly
"I don't know..."

Elly
"This is in the Solarian
language, but it's been
encoded.
Hold on......
Ummm......
What is this......?
..............."

Elly
"Hold on!
It's hard to translate
this stuff!
Ummm...
...'Lambs'...
great war...collapse...
re-education...
...postwar rehab plan...
...based on...
...schedule for building
'Gate' foundations...
'Lambs'...02-04 to Ignas
...05-08 to Aquvy...
11-16 to be uniformly
distributed...
Put into practice...
...'Ethos' established
as an organization...
...Supervision by elders
...conference...
supervision by the Gazel!?
The 'Ethos' is...!?"

Elly
"In short,
it's like this...
500 years ago, there was
a great war that occurred
between Solaris and the
land dwellers.
It's not clear what the
outcome was, but after the
war, Solaris feared another
land dweller revolt...
So Solaris built a 'Gate',
or barrier, that separates
Solaris' land from the
rest of the world's land.
The land dwellers who lived
within this Gate were made
to dwell as separate races
and were thus supervised.
To carry out the actual
supervision, Solaris
established the 'Ethos'.
So the 'Ethos' is actually
controlled by the 'Gazel
Ministry', or Solaris'
highest governmental body.
So, yes, the 'Ethos' is
really a 'front', or a
subsidiary organization,
working for Solaris!
Excavation findings, goods
and natural resources from
the surface are transported
to Solaris by the 'Ethos'.
This also includes 'human
resources', or people used
for manual labor and so on.
Basically, this here is the
window between the planet's
surface and Solaris up
there in the skies above.
According to these records,
there's been an enormous
amount of goods and people
tranferred to Solaris!"

Elly
"The rest is mainly about
population distribution
and excavation records.
The amount of detailed
information about races and
their biological data kind
of concerns me though..."

Elly
"There are facilities in
Solaris for accommodating
surface dwellers... I know!
The 3rd class citizen level
- Earth dwellers of various
races are regularly sent
there as manual labor."

Elly
"So, do you think Solaris
is responsible for this
attack on the 'Ethos'?"

Elly
"We're going to
go on further...
Bart and Rico, could
you please accompany
the person from 'Shevat'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Elly
"We're going to
go on further...
Citan and Rico, could
you please accompany
the person from 'Shevat'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Elly
"We're going to
go on further...
Citan and Bart, could
you please accompany
the person from 'Shevat'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Elly
"We're going to

Elly
"While I was checking
the database I found
out something...
There seems to be a person
from 'Shevat' being held
here by the 'Ethos'.
We're going further on...
Bart and Rico, can you
please rescue and
accompany that 'Shevite'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Elly

Citan
"I am sure of it.
This has to be the
'Ethos' data bank."

Citan
"I say...a facility of
this magnitude would even
be hard to find in Solaris.
Why would the 'Ethos'
have such a set up?"

Citan
"Hmm...
the plot thickens..."

Citan
"Here is a relatively
recent record...
It also indicates that
there has been a large
amount of people
sent to Solaris...
The majority of them were
people who had come to the
'Ethos' seeking help or
spiritual salvation."

Citan
"This could be
your answer..."

Billy
"What?"

Citan
"The 44th salvage plan."

Bart
"The 44th salvage plan?
Isn't that what the
captain of the Thames
was talking about?"

Citan
"This is the only plan
that is not linked to
Solaris...
It must have been
initiated by the 'Ethos'
itself, as a completely
independent project.
It was commenced about
... 19 years ago.
Allow me to display
the data..."

Citan
"So, from this, it appears
that under Aquvy lies an
ultra-ancient civilization.
They have been doing a huge
number of test-digs and
obtained a vast quantity of
resources from the ruins.
Biological weapons...
reactive weapons...
Hmm...I see, so this must
be their intention...
My assessment of the
circumstances is that the
'Ethos' is attempting to
break away from Solaris...
And once freed from its
master, it is likely to
attempt world
domination on its own."

Rico
"Attempt a breakaway...and
attempt world domination...
That's a rather ambitious!"

Citan
"Yes, but the real 
intentions of the 'Ethos'
are quite obvious...
The fact that they are
not reporting the results,
let alone the site's very
existence, gives it away...
The 'Ethos' is planning
to revolt by monopolizing
this ultra-advanced
civilization's resources!
Actually, such rebellions
have been quite common..."

Citan
"Yes, that is probably it.
Shall we move along? There
could be more to find yet!"

Citan
"It is okay. I have
adjusted the computer
to keep that lock open."

Bart
"The 'Ethos' data bank?"

Bart
"Anyway, this isn't
something we can just
check all on our own.
We should bring everyone
here we can."

Bart
"So that's it."

Bart
"Yeah, but even then...
this place is damn well
equipped. Look at it!"

Bart
"So, Solaris!?"

Bart
"What's going on here?
What is this place?
Hey, Billy!
You know anything
about this!?"

Bart
"Citan, what is that
being displayed there?"

Citan
"It looks like some
transmission record
from somewhere...
We might be able to
find some clues here.
Wait one moment..."

Citan
"Alright...
Now I am able to transmit
it to the main displays."

Bart
"What the heck is this!?
Why's the 'Ethos' looking
into this kinda stuff?
On top of that, that
Shakhan's a bishop!? Wasn't
he excommunicated from the
'Ethos' 17 years ago!?"

Bart
"There's a terminal switch
over here too. ...Huh?
What's with these letters?
I can't read this."

Bart
"C'mon, hurry up!"

Bart
"Huh?"

Bart
"So...
what does this
all mean?"

Bart
"Surely not all of them?
What happened to the ones
that didn't become Etones?"

Billy
"Well...arrh...?"

Bart
"It's all becoming
clear then, eh...
How about it, Elly?"

Rico
"So this is the source
of their labor supply."

Billy
"Judging from our position,
this room is right under
the cathedral...
Which could mean that this
is the 'Ethos' data bank?"

Billy
"This data bank holds all
the information concerning
the 'Ethos'.
From the past to the
present... everything!
This facility is strictly
off limits to us.
Only the Bishop class
can ever enter this area."

Billy
"Don't ask me...
How would I know... This is
my first time in here...!"

Billy
"B, but, why would the
'Ethos' be sending
supplies to Solaris!?"

Billy
"This can't be!
I've heard nothing
of the sort!"

Billy
"They became Etones...
like me..."

Billy
"But that's impossible...!
How could that be..."

Billy
"Even if that was the case,
who would kill all those
'Ethos' people, and why!?"

Billy
"The 'Ethos'...
My 'Ethos'...
My faith..."

Bart
"Hey, Billy!
How long you plannin'
on being like that?
Get a hold of yourself!"

Citan
"This is all just
speculation based on
circumstantial evidence.
It would be best for you
to confirm what is the
truth with your own eyes."

Billy
"B, but, that door
is locked though..."

Rico
"Data bank?"

Rico
"Regardless, we can't
do this by ourselves.
Let's go get the rest
of the gang."

Rico
"Yeah, as I thought, huh."

Rico
"The 'Ethos' has been
assaulted by someone...
And in the basement...
we find a Solarian
facility..."

Rico
"Then let's
investigate...!?"

Rico
"That can't be the case
if he's been sending in
regular reports."

Rico
"It's all a front!
The 'Ethos' is really a
subsidiary organization
of Solaris."

Rico
"So, the 'Ethos' has
been manipulating us, heh.
Anything else?"

Rico
"So what happened to all
those people you've seen
coming here for help?"

Elly
"We'll handle this here.
You three should go on
further and investigate."

Elly
"I am sure of it!
This has to be the
'Ethos' data bank!"

Elly
"...Wait a minute!

Bart and Rico, can
you please rescue and
accompany that 'Shevite'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Elly
"While I was checking
the database I found
out something...
There seems to be a person
from 'Shevat' being held
here by the 'Ethos'.
We're going further on...
Bart and Rico, can
you please rescue and
accompany that 'Shevite'
to the Yggdrasil?"

Citan
"If the 'Ethos' is indeed
under the control of
Solaris, as we suspect...
...then there should be
something in here that
would prove their
connection to each other.
You should go on further
and see if you can find
any more clues."

Citan
"I am sure of it.
This has to be the
'Ethos' data bank."

Citan
"I say... a facility of
this magnitude would even
be hard to find in Solaris.
Why would the 'Ethos'
have such a set up?"

Citan
"Hmm...
the plot thickens..."

Citan
"Here is a relatively
recent record...
It also indicates that
there has been a large
amount of people
sent to Solaris...
The majority of them were
people who had come to the
'Ethos' seeking help or
spiritual salvation."

Citan
"This could be
your answer..."

Billy
"What?"

Citan
"The 44th salvage plan."

Bart
"The 44th salvage plan?
Isn't that what the
captain of the Thames
was talking about?"

Citan
"This is the only plan
that is not linked to
Solaris...
It must have been
initiated by the 'Ethos'
itself, as a completely
independent project.
It was commenced about
...19 years ago.
Allow me to display
the data..."

Citan
"So, from this, it appears
that under Aquvy lies an
ultra-ancient civilization.
They have been doing a huge
number of test-digs and
obtained a vast quantity of
resources from the ruins.
Biological weapons...
reactive weapons...
Hmm...I see, so this must
be their intention...
My assessment of the
circumstances is that the
'Ethos' is attempting to
break away from Solaris...
And once free from its
master, it is likely it
will attempt world
domination on its own."

Rico
"Attempt a breakaway...and
attempt world domination...
That's an incredible plan."

Citan
"Yes, but the real 
intentions of the 'Ethos'
are quite obvious...
The fact that they are
not reporting the results,
let alone the site's very
existence, gives it away...
The 'Ethos' is planning
to revolt by monopolizing
this ultra-advanced
civilization's resources!
Actually, such rebellions
have been quite common..."

Citan
"Yes, that is probably it.
Shall we move along? There
could be more to find yet!"

Citan
"It is okay. I have
adjusted the computer to
keep that lock open."

Bart
"But who would've guess
that Solaris was behind
the 'Ethos'?
Looks like there's more
than meets the eye with
this case."

Bart
"Yeah, so it seems...
This is a surprise."

Bart
"Yeah, but even then...
this place is damn well
equipped. Look at it!"

Bart
"So, Solaris!?"

Bart
"What's going on here?
What is this place?
Hey, Billy!
You know anything
about this!?"

Bart
"Citan, what is that
being displayed there?"

Citan
"It looks like some
transmission record
from somewhere...
We might be able to
find some clues here.
Wait one moment..."

Citan
"Alright...
Now I am able to transmit
it to the main displays."

Bart
"What the heck is this!?
Why's the 'Ethos' looking
into this kinda stuff?
On top of that, that
Shakhan's a bishop!? Wasn't
he excommunicated from the
'Ethos' 17 years ago!?"

Bart
"There's a terminal switch
over here too.
...Huh?
What's with these letters?
I can't read this."

Bart
"C'mon, hurry up!"

Bart
"Huh?"

Bart
"So...
what does this
all mean?"

Bart
"Surely not all of them?
What happened to the ones
that didn't become Etones?"

Billy
"Well...arrh...?"

Bart
"It's all becoming
clear then, eh...
How about it, Elly?"

Rico
"So this is the source
of their labor supply."

Rico
"It's a strange feeling to
think our history may have
been directed by Solaris."

Rico
"Apparently."

Rico
"The 'Ethos' has been
assaulted by someone...
And in the basement...
we find a Solarian
facility..."

Rico
"Then let's
investigate...!?"

Rico
"That can't be the case
if he's been sending in
regular reports."

Rico
"It's all a front!
The 'Ethos' is really a
subsidiary organization
of Solaris."

Rico
"So, the 'Ethos' has
been manipulating us, heh.
Anything else?"

Rico
"So what happened to all
those people you've seen
coming here for help?"

nanomachine colony, at
least we can save some
chosen people.
But you don't understand
how to utilize this.
You can't save anyone.
Are you willing to take
the responsibility for
the loss you will cause
humankind?"

Stone
"My job now is to bring
this nanomachine colony
back to Krelian.
You see, unlike the
'Ethos', our aim is not
the ancient weapons that
lay in the city ruins.
I don't think we conflict
with your interests."

Stone
"I see that I couldn't
make you understand...
Then it cannot be helped...
I don't have the time to
convince you further.
Please excuse me, as I
must hurry on ahead."

Stone
"Sorry to have kept you 
two ladies waiting...
It's time for you to do
your job, Elements."

Stone
"Tolone! Seraphita!
Buy me as much time
as possible!"

Stone
"Thanks.
I'm hopeless
with machines."

Stone
"Actually, Krelian hasn't
told me very much.
Nothing apart from the
'Salvation of Humankind'.
Anyway, even if I knew
I wouldn't tell you..."

...Hmph!

Tolone
"We know, we know!
Stop ordering us
around, already!"

Tolone
"Yeah, right.
It's only because it
is on Ramsus orders.
Jeez...!
Now he's got us
protecting this
garbage."

Tolone
"Well, that's how it is
folks...It'll help us if
you'd hurry up and lose."

Tolone
"Well, excu~se us!
But we can't let you go
just yet...
We really don't care much
for Krelian, but if we do
a crappy job it'll make
Ramsus look bad.
But, thanks to you fools
reviving her, we can get
this mission over with
sooner than we thought."

Tolone
"Oh Sera...
Don't tell them that!
Just as I was building
things up to make us sound
psychologically superior
to them! Damn..."

Tolone
"That's 'Positronic-photon
Brain', you idiot!
'Gin n'tonic Futon'...?
You make me sound like I'm
a sleepy drunk!
(It's already bad enough
as it is...
'Positronic-photon Brain
Cyborg'...
That's bound to get us
into trouble with the
makers of 'Star Trech'!)"

Tolone
"Uh oh!! Sorry."

Tolone
"That's it!!"

Tolone
"Seraphita!!
Enough already!
We've done the job
that was required
of us.
Let's pull out!!"

Seraphita
"Hey, Tolone. Let's hurry
up and get this over with
so we can get outta here!
I don't like dark places!"

Seraphita
"Hey! Tolone!
It's so cute...
But on second thought,
it's creepy!!"

Seraphita
"Yeah, we didn't know how
to operate that machinery,
so we were so confused!
Thank you very much
for your kind help!"

Seraphita
"What!...But...
When people do you a
kindness you should always
say thank you. That's what
grandma always said..."

Seraphita
"But, I'm impressed Tolone!
'Psychologically superior'?
Your 'Gin n'tonic Futon
Brain' cyborg inplants
sure make you smart!"

Seraphita
"Sorry!!"

Seraphita
"...Tolone,
do we want to be 
called 'harmless'?"

Seraphita
"A~hh!
Tolone!
Wait for me!"

Barrier Terminated

Citan

Billy!?... No good...
There is no response!!"

Citan
"Too late...!

"Father..."

Billy
"What!?
Th, then,

...Oh my god!!"

Jessie
"Billy, if we merge
our Gears
together...
...then we can break
through that barrier
with our combined
attack.
I'm gonna borrow your
shoulder for a moment,
so start aiming now."

Jessie
"Billy, you know
now don't you? 
Stein's teachings
were all a deception.
That fabricated faith was
just a worldly system for
compensating those people
with fragile souls.
But, faith and god aren't
things which are given to
you from others, right?
They are things you
have to discover
within yourself,
and by yourself.
Things that cannot
be put into words,
things that cannot
be expressed...
Isn't that what god is
all about? 'Question
not thy god, for thy
god doth not respond.'"

Jessie
"The reason I taught you
how to use a gun as a 
child was to save people.
You say that guns
are just tools for
killing people.
But you are wrong.
'Guns' don't kill people.
'People' kill people.
Have you ever looked at
the expressions on the
faces of those reapers
you have destroyed?
It is an excruciating
process to be turned
into a reaper.
To ease their torturous
pain, they seek human
blood, and attack people
in order to get it.
But, that does not
vanquish the true pain
within their hearts.
There is only one way to
be saved from the pain.
That is by termination.
Didn't all those reapers
put out of their misery
by you have peaceful
looks on their faces?
Your gun saved those
people who were turned
into reapers. It's not
something anyone can do.
The faith that enabled
you to accomplish that
was no deception...
God exists within you!"

Jessie
"Alright, now!
Let's go,
Billy, go!"

Jessie
"Let's wrap this up once
and for all, eh Stein?
But, I want you to know
that you aren't gonna
see Racquel when you
die...!
That's because your
destination is going
to be hell!"

 "A discussion on the
excavated Slave Generators 
and their special effects"
 Strange engines discovered
in structures buried under-
ground in ancient times, the
"Sub-" or "Slave Generators"
(hereafter abbreviated as 
"S.G."'s) have, after diverse
study, become widely known to
have their output divided
into 3 levels.
However, it has been
ascertained that a higher
mode exists that far surpasses
these output levels.
 For convenience's sake we 
shall call this 'Hypermode'.
Hypermode is invoked at a
certain probability when an
S.G.'s attack level reaches
three. The explanation below
covers the various conditions
and probabilities for
invocation, that we have been
able to ascertain at present,
assuming that a S.G. has been
installed into a humanoid
fighting machine (or "Gear").
In all cases, a basic
constant exists, which we
observe to be approximately
the value of 5. 
The probability is computed
by multiplying this constant
by one tenth of the
percentage that the HP have
been reduced.
For example, if a Gear's HP
has been reduced by 50% of
its total, then the chance of
invocation would be
     5 x 50/10 = 25 (%)
 So in this case, when the
Attack Level reaches 3,
there is a 25% chance that
Hypermode will set into
motion.
Also, apart from this, there
are modification values,
which are added to the basic
value accordingly with the 
release of each attack from 
levels 1 to 3.
 In other words, the chances
of Hypermode being invoked 
increases the more a Gear 
attacks and the more the Gear
is attacked.
The S.G.'s Hypermode induced
by the aforementioned
probability can emit
immeasurable amounts of
energy, so from that aspect
may appear ideal for use as
the master-engine of a
fighting machine.
However, in reality they
have not yet progressed
to the level of use as power
for actual warfare due to
reasons such as their
unpredictability and
the fact that no Gear-frame
exists that is rigid enough
to possibly endure these
energy emissions.

...former WWW Heavy
Weight Champion and 5 time
hit movie star BIG JOE (Real
name: Joey Balboa) added
NBA's player-of-the-match to
his list of accomplishments
for the year, which includes
the Wimbledon Grandslam, a
baseball triple-crown and 
the Pulitzer prize.
But at the awards' ceremony,
when he went to shake hands,
he slipped, hit his head
and went home brain-damaged,
burnt out and thinking he's 
Elvis...

The 'ELDRIDGE' was equipped
with history's first ever
inexhaustible pseudo-perpetual
engine. This was not just a
highly efficient generator,
but it also made possible
the production of defense
fields from its unique 'A.O.
(Absolute Object) space' and
the actuation of hyper-light-
speed 'S.V. (Subject Variable)
navigation' etc..
 With a design based on the
Heisenberg proposition's S
Matrix, which is the solution 
to the Uncertainty Principle's
reciprocal relationship of
particles (or Cosmic Wave),
it was thus also known as the
'S Matrix Engine' or 
'Heisenberg Engine'.
 In principle, assuming all
phenomena of the immediate
future, including the present,
are potential phenomena, it
actualizes the most convenient
phenomenon amongst these
active subjects as the actual
phenomenon and accordingly
takes advantage of the
resulting energy potential
displacements.

Miang, as she appeared

But I don't know who
her host body was.
She resided at the side
of the  Prime Minister,
manipulating the world
behind the scenes.

To resurrect Deus?

In the beginning, yes.
But later it was different.
Many people then, couldn't
have children. They were
defective humans...
So...she did it over again.

Right before man was about
to be killed out by war, a
new being was born to foster
the next generation.
Remember the missiles in
the Mass-driver facility?
That was the most important
thing to the Zeboim people.
Because of that, we now are
descendants of the few
strong people who survived.

what's inside of it."

Rico
"Hammer said this
lighthouse base is
thousands of years old.
It's sturdy, so they put
a light on top of it to
make it into a lighthouse.
But nobody knows what's
inside of it."

Maria
"This tower was here long
before Shevat flew into
the wild, blue yonder.
People put a light on top
of it to make it into a
lighthouse. But no one
knows what's inside."

Citan
"The base of this light
house was built several
thousand years ago.
Islanders added a light
to make it into a light-
house. But no one knows
what it really is."

Last time at sea, I was

Dominia
"Of course.
The ancient mobile gun
platform floating above
Ignas...
And this reflector,
here, at Babel Tower...
I know of your plan to use
them together to destroy
the Gate generator below
the 'Ethos' headquarters.
But, of course, I won't
let you do it."

Dominia
"Here I come!"

Dominia
"I'll let you off easy
this time. 
Next time is for real!"

Dominia
"Amazing how you've held
up till now.
But this next one will be
your finish."

Dominia
"Now! 
Destroy the control 
room!"

Dominia
"Damn...
Too late..."

Dominia
"We'll continue this
later!
Let's go Kelvena!"

Kelvena
"For the Commander's honor
and the pride of the 
Elements,
you need to be 
more flexible."

"How long will it hold?...
I'm going!"

Kelvena
"Let's finish this."

Kelvena
"What should we 
do Dominia?"

Kelvena
"Elly, I didn't
want to be your enemy...
But since our motives are
different, I guess there
was no choice.
We'll meet again.
And settle things at

Fei
"Uh...it doesn't move.
Is it broken...?
...?
There's something small
written here...
'The one who attains the
dawn, the dusk, and the
darkness shall climb the
path to heaven...Wiseman'
What is this?"

Fei
"Alright, then...
Set those three stones we
found into here..."

The stepping stone has
been brought back to life.

Oh, we rarely have
visitors from the surface.
Welcome to the wandering 
city in the sky, Aphel 
Aura.

This city used to be the
capital of Shevat, an
independent liberal country 
that fought against Solaris.
A place that turns
yesterday's tears into
tomorrow's smiles...
That's what they called
this city a long time ago...
But now, those hopes and
despairs have been worn
away long ago...
Probably the only things
that remain are the echoes
of resentment...

You might be able to find
something that can solve
your troubles and sadness.
But fate can be cruel
sometimes...
Don't forget that.

And, that stone plate
floating there is called
a Stepping Stone. It
moves with people on it.
Try and get on it and
talk to the stone.
It'll be glad to give
three of you a ride.

Do you want to go up?
    Yes
    No

Do you want to go down?
    Yes
    No

Oh, are you new?
It's been so long since
last time we had a visitor
from the surface.
This is a 'Plant Shell'.
Vegetables and fruits
needed in Shevat are grown 
in it.

Since we live away from
the land, we must put
more effort to get food.
Right now, it's a dusty
season so only the staff
members are allowed to 
go in.
Humans are good carriers 
of germs, you know.

I'll bring some fresh
Thunder Strawberries for
you to eat. So look
forward to it.

Hello, what can I do for
you?
    I want thread!
    Hear a story

After all, pain only
causes more pain and
sadness...
How come those guys up
there don't understand
such a simple thing...?
Just relax, have fun
fishing like that sage
who disappeared.

Do you like fishing?
    Yes
    Not really...

I see. Then, do you want
to try catching some fish
in the plaza? Fishing is
prohibited there though.

I see...
The sage loved fishing.
He used to go to the plaza
and catch Leviathans.
After catching the fish,
he'd feed it some small
black stone and let it
go... 
I wonder if that was 
just fish food.

I have some good thread.
Want it for 50G?
    I'll buy it!!
    No thanks...

Hey, you already have some
good spider thread.
Try hanging the line in
the center of the plaza.
You'll catch a fish if
you're good.

Here you go.
Thanks.
Try hanging the line in
the center of the plaza.
You'll catch a fish if
you're good.

Received Spider Web!

You have no money?
Come back when you do.

Are you sure?
It's good thread...

This city has been
wandering the sky like
this for 500 years...
Just watching the 
everchanging countries, 
the world, and those who
appeared and disappeared...
The people in Shevat lost
power, so that's all they
could do...
Being able to observe may
have been a reward for
those people here.

The people in this city
had dreamed of going
down to the land again
for a long time...
They dreamed of the day
when they could go down
to the free world after
fleeing from Solaris...
I have a hunch the day
may not be too far away.

Why do humans hate and
hurt each other?
Everyone lives under
the same blue sky...
Will there ever be any
relief from the pain of
losing what was precious
to us?
When will it be the day 
we can understand what
all this loneliness and
sorrow was for?
In short, we may be
repeating the same 
mistake we made
500 years ago...

This is the end of the
city. If you're not
leaving yet, you better
turn back.

Oh, so you're waiting
to meet up with Maria?
    Yes, that's right!
    No, we're not.

If that's the case then...
under there is a house that
no one lives in anymore.

Maria often used to go there
and sit all alone in the
second floor of that house
and think about things.
Why don't you check out the
place and see what you can
find while you wait for her
there...

Oh? So you're not? Sorry.
Well anyway, why not rest
up and unwind in our fair
city...

   Don't listen to cry babies!
   Attend every morning!
   No unplanned trips!
   Keep the ocean clean!"

Hey, haven't seen you
before. You new?
Welcome to the Shevat
Liberation barracks!!
...But in actuality, we
aren't as glorious as the
name may suggest. Hahaha...
But it is true that this
is the barracks for the
anti-Solaris troops. Think
of this as home and relax.

But...we're in an odd
situation.
We're picking a fight with
an organization that has
the power to manipulate
the world from the shadows.

Heh, and to think we're
all just a motley crew of
rioters from the land
below.
We're just a bunch of 
people who've lived most of
our lives without knowing 
the existence of Shevat or
Solaris...
Come to think of it, 
it almost sounds like a
joke.

So where did you fellas
come from? From the looks
of it, I'd guess you're
from the Ignas continent.
Were you saved by the people
here too? I understand. We 
were all in the same
situation.
Everyone's got their unique
story on how they got
involved in this fiasco with
the Gebler and the 'Ethos'
and all.
The usual pattern here is
that many of the people were
almost eliminated for some 
reason they don't know but 
were saved by the people here
before they were doomed.

That's basically it. 
From now on we're all on
the same boat. 
Welcome aboard!

Back in Kislev, I used
to deal with homemade
medicines.
By the way, I've heard 
rumors that the enemy
has some really cool
medicines.
I wanted to learn some of
those techniques, so I
snuck into their shop
but...I was a little
clumsy...heh.

I got desperate and somehow
managed to escape, and make
my way to Thames - the city
I had heard stories about.
That's where the good people
here picked me up.
If they hadn't picked me up
then, without a doubt, I 
would've been a guinea pig 
for their experimental 
drugs...
Because I'm so cute.

Yeah! Even if I were to
have returned back to the
land, they would probably
try to capture me again.
It wouldn't matter how
many lives I had, it still
wouldn't be enough.
So I've decided to stick
around here.
That's probably the case
for the majority of the
people here.

And anyway, don't you wanna
make the bad guys pay for
it? They gotta be crazy if
they think we'll just take
this lying down!

Yo, this house is basically
an apartment for us land
dwellers that were saved.
I've heard that there
aren't that many pure
Shevites in this town
anymore.
Basically, it's been said
that a majority of them
were lost in that war with
Solaris 500 years ago.

Well, if we're not careful
ourselves, our fates may
be similar too. Heh.

Ha...

Yeah, they say this city used
to be like any other city 
when it was on the ground 
500 years ago.
But after losing to Solaris, 
they launched just the 
palace block of the city up 
into the sky.
It's basically an unbelievable
story, but in reality we're 
riding on that part of the 
city, and floating out in the
sky right now.
In life, you never know what
to expect.

This is just between you and
me but, I am the one and 
only hope for Shevat.
I am the secret agent man...
In other words, I'm a spy!
Well? Ain't I cool?
...But, come to think of it,
if you're here too, you 
guys are probably no
different than me...sigh...

Have you already met with
Queen Zephyr? A very nice
person she is.
We are all able to live
like this because the
Queen saved us.

That large white statue of
an angel at the entrance 
of the palace is a 
representation of a
particular woman who
sacrificed herself in that
war 500 years ago.
It's so sad. She was probably
the beloved heroine of
the rebellion back then.

Damn it, where is the

Yow...!?

Who are you, a new face?
Don't scare me...
I was wondering if there're 
some drinks in here.

Are the higher ups still
planning on fighting with
some country called
Solaris?
Aren't they the scary
guys who actually control
the world from the 
shadows?
Uhh...this is crazy.
Just when I thought I was
able to survive.
I can't take it anymore.

But just you and I
can find 'the answer'
someday..."

'A distant promise'...
A poem composed long
ago...
Can you find 'the answer'
which supposedly exists
somewhere...?

We're all part of a larger
world, as one of its
countless fragments.
All their shapes and
colors are unique...
It's nice yet sad...

Long time ago, one of the
three sages said
something like that.

A part of you remains at
a place you love.
A fragment of you calls
for you to return.
That is why one returns
to the place he loves
again and again.

A part of you may be
calling you to the place
you loved.

Look at these birds.
They have forgotten how
to fly during the long
history of evolution.

We humans are the same.
We threw away our broken
wings, and forgot how to
fly...
But I doubt it will end
like this. We'll remember
the sky again, someday.
Running into the deep,
vast blue sky forever...
The day will come again.

Don't you think so?

Oh, it's you guys?
Sorry, but although the
"Deep Sea Bros" is open,
we aren't doing any
business for a while.

Hello and welcome...
As you can see, the "Deep
Sea Bros" is open...it's
just that we aren't doing
any business right now.

The floating rock back

Sometimes it's good to

The angel stood watch as
the night ended. Twilight
nodded off in the arms of
a lost child from 500
years ago...And the Sea
Serpent swallowed the dark.
A wise gramps taught me
that a looooong long time
ago. Don't know what
it is, though, maybe a spell,
yes maybe it is.

Say, I have something
really good to tell you,
I could let you in on it.
It's a deal you can't
refuse!

Do you wanna know?
    Sure
    No thanks

Hmm...
I see...
You wanna know, yes you
do...
Alright, I'll tell you
about the inspirational
tradition of the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes I will.

Loooong long ago, the
Chu-chu Tribe had a great
big guardian god, who could
step over huge mountains in
one step. The Wondrous
Mambo god, yes he was!
The Chu-chu Tribe and the
Wondrous Mambo god lived
happily together in perfect
peace, yes we did. A dreamy
sweet existence.
But one day, a huuuge red
fireball rained down from
the sky, and blew away our
guardian god as he was
asleep. Blam, kablam, boom!
But don't worry!
The great big guardian god
became a star in the sky!
He protects the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes he does!!

Yes, yes, it's a great
story...No matter how
many times I listen to
it, I'm so moved...yes
I do... 
Be careful now, remember:
Bad guys that pester the
poor Chu-chus will get
punished by our guardian
god, yes they will.

Hmm ooh...
I see,
you want to listen...
Wha? No?
You don't wanna listen?
Are you sure?
I see. Too bad.
It really is a great
story...yes it is...

I hear the Sage in Shevat
did some research on the
Chu-chu Tribe's tradition,
yes he did.
That's a lot of work.
Even the old generations
of the Chu-chu Tribe don't
know many things about it.

There is a rumor that
the secret room of the
Sage of Shevat is hidden
somewhere in this town.
I wonder if it's true?

They're so beautiful.
These are wonderful things
that nobody else sells,
yes they are.
But this's a very important
treasure of the Chu-chu,
so I can't sell it to you.
Sooorry. Please go to the
counter if you'd like to
buy something. Thank you, 
thank you.

...!?
W, wait...!!
What you have in your
hand...is...

The mythical RPS Badge!!

The legendary H&S Badge!!

The Tag Badge even the
maniacs are crazy about!!

This is a complete badge
set of...a gamer!?
I'm so amazed.
It's great, yes it is!!
Hmm...
Want to exchange the three
set with our treasure?
It's a deal, yes it is.

Do you want to exchange it
for Chu-Chu's treasure?
    Sure!
    No way

Let's exchange them.
Here, it is!

Received Charger A!

Received Power Ring S!

Cheapskate!

The guys in Solaris
pestered the Chu-chu Tribe
who'd lived on this star
from the beginning.
So gramps and grandmas
escaped with the people
from Shevat, yes they did.
But most of the Chu-chus
couldn't escape and were
killed...Those guys ate
them, yes they did...
That reminds me...
I'm hungry, yes I am...
I just remembered I
haven't had lunch yet.

Forget the guardian god
of legend. Nobody believes
such fairy tales in this
day and age...no, no.

If a great big guardian
god existed, he'd have
beaten Solaris to death a
loooong time ago, yes he
would.

Just a bunch of
optimistic, happy guys...
What are we to do about
them...

I hope everyone
understands each other,
and lives happily together
someday...yes, I do.

Oh, I want to go down to
the land and live with
other people, yes, I do!!

I like people in Shevat
because they're all nice.
They treat Chu-chus the
same as themselves...yes,
they do.
But I heard people on the
land are all scary.
They lie, say awful
things, hurt and kill
each other...

I am wrong, right? They
are all nice people, right?
    Everyone's nice.
    Not necessarily...

I knew it!
I want to go down to the
land and live with other
people, yes, I do!

I see...I hope everyone
understands each other,
and lives happily together
someday...yes, I do.

You're awfully straight
forward. I like it.
I'll give you this.

Received Aquasol S

Received Aquasol S

Received Aquasol DX

Wha? That's strange.
You smell like soil and
trees, yes, you do.
Looooong ago, the Chu-chu
Tribe lived in the woods,
with no interference,
yes they did.
I wonder if someday, we
could ever return to the
land and live in the
woods again...?

Do you want to go down?
    Yes
    No

Shevat - 1476

Hello, surface people.
Look at this picture.
It's me and my wife a
long time ago.

It may be hard to believe
but there was a time when
we were young too,
full of dreams and hopes.
My wife died two years ago.
So, I asked the people in
the world below to bury
her ashes in the earth.
My time will also come
soon... Could you young
people bury my ashes in
the earth for me too...?
I'm tired of...waiting...
and believing...
I want to rest in peace
in the earth.

But I was wondering
what it would be like to
live without getting old
like Queen Zephyr...
What has she seen,
and heard for the past
500 years?
Did what she see and
hear really bring her
happiness...?
That, I don't know.

This country's been
through a lot.
We no longer have enough
strength to fight Solaris...

You people from the
world below should go
to the royal palace.
Queen Zephyr will listen
to your wishes and show
you the way.
You may be the new hope
for those who're against
Solaris...

Do you want to go down?
    Yes
    No

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shevat - 1478
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This store is about to be
closed. Gears aren't
needed in this town except
the Queen's troops...
But, please take a look.
We no longer have much
business, but all the items
are our pride and joy.

Thank you.
If you need anything,
please stop by again.
We'll try to help you
as much as we can.

What's the use of having
a Gear if there's no one
to ride on it?
The only Gear that needs
maintenance is Maria's
Gear which is hardly ever
used.

Well, to be honest with
you, we don't have any
chance in this fight...
Unless a miracle happens.
The battle was probably
settled at the point where
they let her escape in that
war 500 years ago.

We don't have equipment
or materials like Solaris
does. What the hell do
they want us to do?
Damn it! We aren't at a
disadvantage when it
comes to technology and
ideas...

Do you want to go up?
    Yes
    No

Fei
"Alright.
Let's go up there."

Fei
"Balthasar...?
I've heard of that name
before."

Fei
"That's right!
Ol' man Bal,
the hermit."

Fei
"That reminds me, the Gear
I saw resembles Bal's Gear,
Calamity."

Fei
"I just happened to come
across him in the cavern
underneath Aveh's desert.
I didn't know him that
well...
So you're Ol' man Bal's
grandchild."

Fei
"Nope...
This doesn't work
either."

Fei
"No...
This is no time to go
down."

Citan
"You are right...
We came this far,
we cannot turn back
now, Fei."

Fei
"Shevat...the only
organization that stands
against Solaris..."

Bart
"Okay, let's bring 
20-30 of those Gears that
kid was riding on, home!"

Bart
"Hey, Fei. Isn't that the
same name as the
eccentric old man?
Remember the crazy old
man playing with Gears
underground Aveh?"

Bart
"But, the crazy o....
your grandpa looked just
fine.
He's the kind that never
dies. Don't worry,
squirt."

Bart
"Sorry.
Don't get mad, squi...
Maria.
I didn't meant to offend.
I apologize.
Sorry, sorry."

...

Rico
"A country that's a flying
saucer, eh...I never
thought we'd end up here."

Billy
"The cursed land,
Shevat... The answer's
gotta be here."

Girl
"This is the dock floor
located at the lowest
layer of Shevat."

Girl
"I met you a little
while ago. My name is
Maria Balthasar."

Maria
"Calamity!?
That's the prototype Gear
my grandfather made."

Maria
"Do you know my grandpa?
Where is he now!?"

Maria
"Yes...but I haven't seen
him for the past few
years..."

Maria
"He said he was looking
for something very
important.
And he left by himself
...
My father was captured
by Solaris and his
whereabouts are not
known either..."

Maria
"I'm not a 'squirt'!!
Besides, my grandpa 
isn't a crazy old man,
I know it!!"

Maria
"I heard you say sorry
once already. You don't
need to say it again."

Maria
"Anyhow...
Queen Zephyr is waiting.
Please go ahead and take
the elevator to go 
upstairs.
I still have to finish
inspecting Seibzehn."

Maria
"I'm glad Grandpa Bal's
doing fine."

Maria
"Please go ahead and
take the elevator to
go upstairs.
I still have to finish
inspecting Seibzehn."

Maria
"I'll show you the way
to the Palace when the
time comes.
Till then, please take
a look around town."

Maria
"I'll see you later."

Do you want to go down?
    Yes
    No

Do you want to go up?
    Yes

Then, let's go!"

do it!"

The defensive shutter is
closed..."

Maria
"We may be able to go
down if we use the 
emergency shaft. 
But it's not normally
used..."

Maria
"I see.
The entrance to the shaft
is just above here."

Maria
"This is it.
We can go down by entering
the shaft from here."

Do you want to go up?
    Yes
    No

Maria
"Father!?
Is it really you,
Nikolai, my father!?"

Maria
"!!!
...Why did you do such
a horrid thing!?"

Maria
"No!"

Maria
"!?
...Seibzehn's trembling.
...Are you crying?
...Brainwashed by
Solaris, my real
father is already...
... Achtzehn is...
Not my father!"

Maria
"...Achtzehn!
I will defeat you!!
Seibzehn, let's go!!"

Maria
"!! Father!
Have you come
to your senses!?
No!
I can't do it!!
The Graviton Cannon...
you yourself had it
sealed up because of
its destructive power.
Father, if I use
that on you..."

Maria
"...I can't. 
I can't bring
myself to do it!!
Huh! Seibzehn!
Don't... I can't
control you! Father,
are you doing this!?
Please, don't make
him shoot!!"

Maria
"...Faaaaaatheeerrr!!"

Achtzehn
"Maria...
Have you been a
good little girl?
Look, this is Achtzehn.
I've been able to merge
myself with Achtzehn
through the M Project
research in Solaris.
Observe the birth of the
ultimate in reflexive
speed by the unification
of man and machine!
No normal Gear could
ever hope to defeat
this Achtzehn!"

Achtzehn
"Hmph. 'Horrid?'
No, Maria.
It is 'glorious.'
Yes, yes. I shall also
modify you and your
Seibzehn to become one
entity, just like me."

Achtzehn
"Hah hah hah. Rebelling?
I see, you've already
reached that age...
Come now, don't be so
spoiled like that,
come... here.
Won't... you listen
to... YOUR FATHER!!
COME HERE NOW!"

Achtzehn
"What are you saying...
It's me...
Your father... Nikolai..."

Nikolai
"Maria...
can you hear me?
I'm going to release
your Graviton Cannon
from its seal by
remote control!
Use that to
defeat me."

Nikolai
"Fire!! It doesn't
matter... I, Nikolai,
no longer exist...
Before I was brain-
washed by Solaris, I
implanted a conscience
circuit in Achtzehn...
This would respond and
activate in the presence
of Seibzehn. My message
is coming from there.
And, during the battle,
I transferred all my
data from there to
Seibzehn.
I may have lost my body,
but my spirit is with
Seibzehn, no, with you,
Maria. Now and forever!"

Nikolai
"Maria... I will always
be with you.
Now and forever..."

Dominia
"What do I mean?
You'll understand it
when you hear the story."

Dominia
"I don't lie, Maria.
This is the truth.
Your splendid father
succeeded in fusing man
and machine.
And he opened the gates
to hell for the Lambs."

Don't you think you've
said enough, Dominia?

At one point, weren't
you considered to be
the next Gebler
commander-in-chief!?"

Fei
"Hey Maria.
Don't mind what she
told you..."

Fei
"Wait!
Dominia!"

Fei
"...!?
This...is...?"

Maria
"Where is the
intruder...!?"

Maria
"Undoubtedly, I am the
daughter of Nikolai,
Maria Balthasar!
What about it...?"

Maria
"That's a lie!!
My father wouldn't do
such a horrible thing!!"

Maria
"...!!"

Maria
"...
Father..."

Maria
"..."

Maria
"Seibzehn..."

Maria
"Seibzehn!!"

Maria
"I'm sorry, 
I'm late...
Let's go!
Solaris'...
Solaris'... enemy is
awaiting!!"

Dominia
"Never thought I'd come
across Seibzehn
in my place of escape."

Dominia
"I'll take
Seibzehn.
Originally, this 
belonged to us,
Solaris."

Dominia
"Fool, not even knowing
this Gear is the point
of contact between us."

Dominia
"Heh, then try and
stop me!"

Dominia
"Huh...?"

Dominia
"That child...
Hey, you...
Are you the daughter
of Nikolai...?"

Dominia
"I see...
So you're his beloved
daughter to whom he offered
himself to undertake that 
difficult task..."

Dominia
"Hey, young girl.
Want to hear
an interesting story?
Let's see...
How about the cursed
secret of
Seibzehn?"

For the past several
decades, our scientists
had put so much effort
into the research to
create evolved Gears.
Regardless of how great a
pilot one is, as long it
is human, there will
always exist a time lag
and human error when
interfacing with a
machine.
That's when your father,
Nikolai was targeted.
He was a genius in the
field of cranial nerve
mechanisms.
They made Nikolai search
for a way for humans to
go beyond humans... By
merging humans and
machines.
In other words, they were
trying to create a new
life, an ultimate living
weapon, by connecting a
living human brain to a
Gear directly.
It would've stayed as a
mere fantasy without
Nikolai. But that genius
made the fantasy come
true...

As a matter of fact,
various data and
components obtained from
the war in Ignas, and the
Battling in Kislev, were
used as experimental
materials.
That is how the special
humanoid mutants, Wels
were born. Wels created
in Solaris were tested
on the surface.
Only the Wels that passed
the tests were dismantled,
restructured, and reborn.
They became the Gear's
central control circuit...
and became part of the
machine...
It's all the result of
your father's great
research.
Seibzehn, is the
prototype of 
a man-machine fusion
Gear.
In other words...
Seibzehn was completed
at the cost of innumerable
land dwellers' lives.

And in the nerve circuit
of Seibzehn lies...

Dominia
"Hmph, fools!
Don't get so cocky.
The party's just begun.
But, I guess it's alright.
My mission is complete.
All that's left is..."

Dominia
"Maria, I'm afraid I must
go now.
Enjoy your party.
Hah hah hah...!"

Dominia
"Who is it!?"

Jessie
"Don't get so excited.
It's not good for your
beauty, Dominia.
We adults have our own
reasons. But you kids
wouldn't understand."

Jessie
"I think you've played
with enough fire for
today. Just go home.
Maria is the only
one who can operate
Seibzehn.
You should be well aware
of that."

Jessie
"It looks like our guests
have arrived.
Let's go upstairs.
The Yggdrasil is also
accommodated in the dock.
I'm sure the other
guys are making a
fuss over it."

Jessie
"I have an ominous
premonition...
I doubt it but...
they could've..."

"It'll take a bit 
more time to inspect
Seibzehn.
Please go up there,
and take a look around
town."

Maria
"This Seibzehn was
developed by my father.
At the research
institute in Solaris..."

Maria
"I just turned five years
old at that time, and had
no clue what was happening.
Using me as a hostage,
they forced my father to
continue the research..."

Maria
"But he never showed his
pain or sorrow in front
of me...
He always smiled 
and said...
'Don't worry, Maria,
 Seibzehn will be
 by your side to
 protect you...' "

Maria
"Five years ago, that day,
when I fell behind in our
escape...
My father protected me
and ended up
being left behind..."

Maria
"My father's voice, his
smiles...are leaving me.
They are far away, 
becoming obscure...
I believed this would
never happen...I swore
I'd never forget...!
Now, the only connection
between my father and me
is this Seibzehn..."

Maria
"But...I'll save my
father someday!
I'll bring back my
father's smile!
Seibzehn and I will
do it, I swear...!!
I swear...!!
..."

Maria
"Sorry...I shouldn't have
told you such a bizarre
story...
It has nothing to do with
you..."

I never thought it'd turn
out that way...
I was scared to death.
We restored the Yggdrasil
to perfection.
It can fly anytime.

Well, talking about
servicing, it's not like
we know everything about
Seibzehn.
Realistically, all we can do
is check for abnormalities
and do simple repairs.

Don't worry,
I'll also take a look at
your Gears later.

It was amazing, I was so
impressed! As long as
Maria and you're with us,
we have the power of a
1000 Gears.
We gave it our all to fix
the Gears and the Yggdra!
At this rate, we can beat
Solaris in one shot!

...Maybe.

They say the fight between
you and Seibzehn
was well matched?
Amazing...
There are still people
from the surface that can
do all that.
No sweat. If we all work
together, we can teach
Solaris a thing or two!

...Maybe

How could Solaris do such
a terrible thing...!!
Damn it!
It's unbearable...to see
the genius, Dr. Nikolai
ending his life like
that...

But, this is such a
monster...Maria's father
designed something really
extraordinary.
I hear he's a Solaris
scientist, but I still
respect him. He proved to
me a genius really exists.

Maria
"I'm coming, Solaris!
Seibzehn and I 
shall be the dark wings
which carry you all to
your deaths!!"

Nikolai
"Seibzehn!!
Is that Maria?"

Maria
"...
It's true that I'm
Maria Balthasar.
But, you...
who are you...?"

Nikolai
"Of course it's me, 
Nikolai!
Look at this, Maria.
The results of my 
research!"

Nikolai
"This huge, powerful,
forever shining body!
There'll be no aging and
death. I was reborn as
a new breed."

Maria
"...
I loved my father in those
days when he was human...
His warm smile...
I wanted him to be by my
side forever!!"

Nikolai
"Maria, you're my
daughter. You know how
stupid humans can be.
You don't need to perish
along with these feeble
humans. Now, come, Maria.
Start a new life with me.
We shall begin a new
chapter in life. Let's
build a bright future
together.
I'll be by your side and
protect you this time for
sure. I promise you."

Maria
"...
Father..."

Maria
"...!!
Seibzehn...!?"

Nikolai
"Seibzehn...
What? You dare stand 
against me, your creator?"

Maria
"T...this is...!!
Seibzehn!?"

Nikolai
"Interesting...
I'll take you on.
I'll show you how great
Nikolai is, and the power
of the Achtzehn.
Come on, Seibzehn!!"

Maria
"...
Father..."

Maria
"Seibzehn and I shall
be the dark wings which
carry you all to your
'deaths'!!"

It's always good to have
a map to look at when you
lose your way, right!?"

Fei
"Hey, that map we found
above here... It looks
like it's for this floor.
If we lose our way, we
can look at that map."

Fei
"It won't open..."

so leave me alone."

Big Joe
"Hm? Looks like that
door will open now."

Big Joe
"You opened this door

Much appreciated!"

Big Joe
"That door just
won't open...
This is no good...
Even Big Joe here
has given up!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maria
"This way, please."

We aren't permitted to
leave here no matter what.
So please, take good care
of Maria for us!

How's the surface doing,
lately?
I'm sure the people down
there are living blindly
yet peacefully as usual.

Are you the newcomers from
the outside? Maria isn't
with you?

It's truly unfortunate
about Professor Nikolai...
But thanks to you all, we
were able to repel the
enemy.
Thank you. And let's
continue to work together
to take down Solaris!

In hopes of making contact
with you and your friends
on the ocean surface...
...the shields were
apparently dropped.
That's when they took
advantage of the situation.
Who would've ever thought
there would actually be a
spy that would get in!?

I seriously doubt any spy
would be able to get in.
And as I expected, since
we have new people from
the surface, there's
increased security.
And you never know what
might happen... If anything
ever happened to the Queen,
it'd be disastrous.

From here on, I cannot
allow you to freely enter
or leave. I am sorry.

This is the library where
many books are gathered.
This place is packed with
many ancient books that
you cannot find on the
surface.
If you're a book fanatic,
you'd drool over books
like our first run prints,
limited books, autograph...
...books, banned books, and
mountains of hard to find
books, and more mountains
and mountains of books...!
Ahhh! It's too much!

Well, setting that aside...
If there's something you
want to know about from the
past, it'd be good to go in
and talk to the librarians.
Don't worry. It's their
job anyway to tell the new
people from the surface
about the past.

...Sigh... Will the day
ever come when I will be
able to live peacefully
on the surface?

Welcome to Shevat. We've
already heard that you are
our guests.
Please use this room as you
please. You are welcome to
use the bed to rest.

When Maria leaves, this
town's going to be just
that much more lonelier.
But, I guess there's no
way around it.
There comes a time, for
everyone, when they must
embark on their own path.

Maria has truly done so
much for us. As of now...
...many of us consider her
to be the guardian angel
of Shevat.
Regardless of how well
she can control
Seibzehn, she's
only a 13 years old girl.
She's probably worried sick
about her father who's been
captured by Solaris...

Who would've ever thought
that would happen to
Professor Nikolai...
What are we to say to
Maria?

Balthasar has strongly told
Maria not to leave Shevat
under any circumstances.
He probably said that
because he knows that if
provided with the chance...
...that child would
immediately try to fly off
to Solaris...
All by herself, to rescue
her captured father,
riding on the
Seibzehn...

The powerless are maimed
and slaughtered all because
those crazed leaders give
out one bloodlusted order.
It doesn't matter how
advanced their technology
or culture is.
It's the same thing. Not
one thing has changed over
the years.
It's gotten so sad, you can
almost laugh! Hah! How long
does this have to last...?

To protect Shevat from the
outside, the ancient
technology of the Gate is
used.
It's fundamentally the same
thing as the stuff Solaris
has planted on the surface.
Even with Solaris'
technology, the Gate cannot
be broken through.
But at times, I come to
think about whether this
Gate is only for protecting
us from Solaris?
Maybe that man left this
Gate behind to separate us.
To isolate us from the rest
of the world.
If that was his intention,
then Krelian is indeed
dreadful... Does that man's
resentment run that deep...

Krelian holds the true
power in Solaris is what
I'm saying... The irony
of fate.
Once, that man fought
alongside Roni Fatima,
Queen Zephyr and Lacan
against Solaris...

Uuhhh, so hungry... Is the
meal ready yet? Whatever
you do, it all goes back to
food. You got that? Food!
For me, I get the feeling
I'm most alive when I'm
eating. Isn't it the same
with you guys?
You eat to live or live to
eat. We don't even know,
do we?
I bet those Solarians are
always eating all the good
stuff. Argh!
That's unforgivable!!

That great war 500 years
ago, I can remember it
like it was yesterday...
That's something I can't
get myself to forget.
Many lives were lost...
Much love, many dreams,
friends, those...
...irreplaceably important
things in our lives were
scarred and left to
bleed...
Are those days going to
return once again...?
I don't want my children or
grandchildren to go through
that nightmare...

You humans are truly
unusual living beings,
aren't chu?
You're all like shattered
fragments of a mirror.

Further down is the prison.
It hasn't been used for
several hundred years
though.
It isn't anything worth
seeing.
Well, I guess you could
say we had a similar
barbaric phase like the
land dwellers!

This is the tactical
command room.
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.
However, who would have
thought they'd attack in
such a way... Aren't they
being a bit hasty?

This is the tactical
command room.
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.
Lately, there's been a lot
of unusual activity down on
the surface...
Hmm. You think Solaris
found something?

Yeah, that was an
incredible battle.
Thanks to you all, we're
somehow still here.
Thank you so much. We're
depending on you till
the day we bring freedom
back to the surface.

So you're the newcomers
from the surface? Hmm...
It seems you all aren't
like the usual land
dwellers we get.
But we're always happy to
have more friends to fight
against Solaris.
I look forward to working
with you.

Go down?
    Yes
    No

Oh my, this has gotten
serious. It seems you can't
get in because of the
emergency security.
But, you are all lucky.
A legendary vendor like
me happens to be here
through coincidence.
I've got a line of quality
goods, sir... So, if you've
got anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

Alright, then what
shall it be?

    Items
    Weapon/Armor
    Gear Parts
    Nevermind

Thank you very much.
If there's anything you
need, please come by
again.

Looong ago, I've heard that
a lone Chu-chu was taken
from the town by a wise
man...
It looks like she's been
well. On top of that, she's
gotten so big and grand...
It's truly a surprise!
Wonder what she was eating.

Looong ago, I've heard
that a lone Chu-chu was
taken from the town by
Wiseman...
I haven't heard what
happened after that.
I hope that Chu-chu
is doing well...

Listen, Hyuga.
I'm going to Solaris, too.

Fei
"Why...are you here!?"

Citan
"Yes...
I will be counting on
that."

Jessie
"Don't misunderstand me.
It doesn't mean I'll help
you.
I don't know what you're
thinking or trying to
do...
But, if you take their
side, I'll kill you without
a doubt. Even from the
back..."

Jessie
"Heh...
so discouraging..."

Wiseman
"Fei, 
go with Shevat.
Your father, Kahn
would've wanted you to..."

Wiseman
"Go ahead, go in."

Wiseman
"You're finally here...
Where have you been?"

Wiseman
"I've told you before.
I learned martial arts
with your father in
Shevat.
The Queen is waiting.
Go ahead."

Maria
"Please come in."

Your Majesty,
something dreadful
has...!!

Fei
"Your Majesty...
You...
The child...?"

Fei
"522...!?
Is that really
possible...?"

Fei
"I see...
You're quite right.
But, there's no guarantee
that you aren't the same
as Solaris, right?
Even if Solaris were to be
defeated, the people of the
surface may just as well
encounter a new dominator."

Fei
"..."

Fei
"Huh...!?"

Fei
"What was that shaking
all about...!?"

Fei
"What!?"

Fei
"Then should we go down
with Maria?
It's the Gebler, right?
I'm still ticked off at
them. I'll take'em on."

Fei
"Then, let's get
going, Maria."

Fei
"Alright, I got it.
Then one of us should
stay behind."

Fei
"Yeah...
I know, doc.
We'll go!
We're already involved.
And, we can't just stand
by and watch these
people die."

Fei
"...?
Going chu help...?
Chu-Chu, what're
you doing here?"

Fei
"What am I gonna do...
This isn't a game.
It's dangerous, so go back
to the Yggdrasil. Okay,
Chu-Chu? Be a good girl."

Fei
"Tch, alright... Don't come
crying to me when things
get outta hand."

Fei
"I'll go too. I'm a little
concerned if it's Elly."

Elly
"Your Majesty...
Y, you...?
You're the...?"

Elly
"...
Yes...
I understand."

Bart
"Thank you for coming...?
What is this?
It's just a kid."

Bart
"Tch.
Something's not right.
This fight for independence
from a tyrant. The battle
for freedom.
I see, you make it seem
like your intentions are
noble.
In reality though, maybe
you're no different than
Solaris?
Anyway, I'm too busy with
trying to take Aveh back
from that bastard, Shakhan.
Hate to break this to you,
but I don't have the time!"

Bart
"Uh..."

Rico
"Hmph... Alright. Your
story sounds quite noble.
But, what is there to stop
Shevat from taking up a
dictatorship after Solaris
falls?
Those taking down the seat
of power usually become...
...infatuated with their
own power and make its
people suffer.

Rico
"Hmm...
I see, now.
So you want to take down
our common enemy first."

Billy
"Your Majesty...
Y, you...?"

Chu-Chu
"Alright! Chu-Chu's
going chu help too!"

Chu-Chu
"Uh hmm... Chu-Chu's not
a good girl. I'm in that
dangerous age right now."

Chu-Chu
"And Chu-Chu
can help chu!
I'm going with
all of you.
Yeah? Yeah?"

Chu-Chu
"R, really?
They're all here?
Yaaay! I finally found
them!! Chu-Chu's friends.
They're here!!"

Chu-Chu
"Now, let's put
everything into it.
Everyone, we have chu
give it our best shot!"

Maria
"Heh, so they call you
Chu-Chu also.
Many of your friends live
in this city. You want to
go meet them later?"

Maria
"Your Majesty, I will go
with Seibzehn!"

Maria
"Fine...
I understand."

Maria
"Yes!
Seibzehn is ready to
go any time!"

Zephyr
"Break the Gate and open
the path to Solaris.
That will lead to the land
dweller's freedom. Please,
Fei."

Zephyr
"Now go and get some
rest for now."

Zephyr
"As usual, be careful.
And take care of Maria
for us."

Zephyr
"Have you decided?"
    My heart is set!
    Let me think some more

Zephyr
"Alright.
Allow me to hear out
your decision."

Zephyr
"Take your time and think
about it to your heart's
content.
To make sure there are no
regrets."

Zephyr
"Thank you for coming such
a long way. I am the Queen
of Shevat, Zephyr."

Zephyr
"I may appear to be like
this, but I am actually
522 years old."

Zephyr
"Yes...
I and a select few of the
vassals have undergone some
special life-extending
treatments.
We were required to
continue living... Until
that final day approaches.
Because of one man...
To continue living...
This is our atonement...
for that tragedy
500 years ago..."

Zephyr
"Let us discontinue this
discussion of the past.
I've heard many things
about all of you from
Wiseman.
Wiseman has been conducting
his operations on the
surface under my orders...
...to keep an eye on that
man's activities.
Also, he was ordered to
bring anyone from the
surface who would be of
help to us to Shevat...
500 years ago we fought
against Solaris for the
freedom of the land
dwellers.
Even after that, we
continue to resist Solaris
although we are short of
any real power."

Zephyr
"Land dwellers, can you
find it in your heart
to help us?
We must free mankind from
the grasps of Solaris...
We must gain true freedom
and build a peacful world
to live in."

Zephyr
"Hmm...You are apparently
nothing like the calm and
quiet Roni Fatima, Bart.
Yet, you are so similar to
Roni at the same time...
There is logic behind what
you say, though."

Zephyr
"However, I tell no lie...
...when I say we are doing
this purely for the future
of the land dwellers.
If you still cannot believe
us, then defeat Solaris,
gain back the independence
of the land dwellers...
...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens
together.
The pretexts of the past,
the discord between
nations. Why be concerned
at such a small scale?
You must look at the bigger
picture!"

Zephyr
"However, I tell no lie...
...when I say we are doing
this purely for the future
of the land dwellers.
If you still cannot believe
us, then defeat Solaris,
gain back the independence
of the land dwellers...
...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens
together."

Zephyr
"It should do you some good
if you rest in the palace
and think about it.
You must think about what
you ought to do.
But remember, Solaris has
been quite active lately.
So we don't have much time
for leisure."

Zephyr
"As for you, Elly...
Your family and friends...
You must understand that
they will all have to be
your enemies.
Without this clear
understanding...
...You may be placing your
companions in a situation
where it may cost them
their lives..."

Zephyr
"Very well then.
Now go and get some rest."

Zephyr
"What's the meaning of
this?"

Yes! That is... We have an
intruder in the dock area!
The Gate generator has been
destroyed...!

Zephyr
"What's the damage report?"

Y, yes! Sub-systems are
destroyed...
Gate generation has
dropped 70% from normal!
We're devoting everything
to fire fighting and
repairs... It will still
take some time!

Zephyr
"What of the intruder?"

Yes, we believe it's just
a lone Gebler soldier.
It seems the individual
has escaped to the number
17 hangar!

Zephyr
"Maria, wait!"

Zephyr
"It is too dangerous
to go by yourself."

Your Majesty, we have our
hands full just trying to
fight the fire on the
shield generator.
If someone doesn't do
something, it's possible
we'll have more losses...!

Zephyr
"Maria, what can you do
now when you don't even
have Seibzehn?"

Zephyr
"...
Is it fine with you, Fei?
Please take care of Maria.
And be careful out there."

Who will you leave here?
    Leave <Perso2>
    Leave <Perso3>

Maria has joined the party!

Zephyr
"Fei..."

Zephyr
"Allow me to put it
on screen."

We are finally able to
locate and see Solaris
after destroying the 3
Gates on the surface.
However, unless we destroy
the final main generator on
the Solaris homeland...
...we cannot completely
wipeout their Gate.

It seems the intruder has
escaped to the hangar bay.
If something happens to
Seibzehn...!

Umm, this may be asking for
too much, but would it be
possible to have one of you
stay behind with the Queen?

We do not have the combat
experience and...if
something ever happened to
the Queen...

Maria
"Was that enemy...!?"

Maria
"Number 17 hangar bay!?
Seibzehn...!!"

Maria
"But...
We can't just let
the spy be...!"

Maria
"I'll be fine.
I can go it alone...!!"

Maria
"...!
But..."

Maria
"Then, let's all go
together."

Elly
"Shall I come along?"
    Change
    Don't change

Elly has joined the party!

Elly
"Yes...!
We'll do what we can to
protect the people here!"

Elly
"Well...
In all the bustle,
she somehow tagged along."

Elly
"Yes...
I can guide you...
through Solaris..."

Elly
"What are you...?
Wait, I didn't mean it
like..."

Elly
"...
Yes..."

Bart
"You want me to come?"
    Change
    Don't change

Bart has joined the party!

Bart
"I don't like the idea of
working for free...
...but I don't like the
idea of turning tail and
running from them even
more!
Let's do it! It doesn't
matter who they are. I'll
take'em all down in my
Brigandier!!"

Billy
"Should I come along?"
    Change
    Don't change

Billy has joined the party!

Billy
"I will go too! The enemy
was able to get in because
they let the Yggdrasil in.
We can't allow the people
of this country to be in
danger because of us..."

Billy
"Shut up! Dad, could you
not say anything!?"

Rico
"You want me to go?"
    Change
    Don't change

Rico has joined the party!

Rico
"Tch. Since the day I met
you all, there's been
nothing but trouble...
But I've come this far with
you all. I guess there's no
point in bitching about it.
I'll show them what happens
when they tick the great
Rico off."

Citan
"Should I come along?"
    Change
    Don't change

Citan has joined the party!

Citan
"The Solaris Gear units are
on a high speed...
...interception course with
Shevat.
It would be reasonable to
believe that their main
targets are going to be the
4 Gate generators.
They are probably planning
on finishing us off since
Dominia's demolition has
weakened the Gate output.
We have scrambled our
interceptor units, but I
do not know how they will
fare...
The people of Shevat are
not accustomed to Gear
tactics.
I want to avoid unnecessary
sacrifices if at all
possible."

Citan
"Here is the breakdown of
the enemy Gear units...
As I have explained before,
4 separate units are each
headed for their respective
generators.
From the information
collected in Shevat...
...we have a good idea
of the capabilities and
composition of the Gear
units...
However, there is one giant
Gear that they are holding
back that we have no
information about."

Citan
"Maria, this is where you
and Seibzehn come in.
Now that the Gate is
weakened, we can use
Seibzehn's heavy
particle cannon...
...to distort space
and neutralize the Gate
for a brief moment!
Upon penetrating into
Solaris, it would be best
to move about...
...in small groups so that
we do not attract
attention.
Well, if possible I would
like to..."

Citan
"Understood!
Then Elly, Fei, and I will
move about together.
The rest will form a
separate group to sneak in.
Maria, it looks like you
and Seibzehn will wait
outside on standby."

Citan
"Well, let us break up
for now.
Once you are all ready,
we should all meet here
before we take off..."

Are you prepped and ready?
    Let's go!
    Not yet

Citan
"Good.
Then we are off."

Citan
"We are depending on you,
Maria.
Please transport us to
Solaris on the
Seibzehn."

Citan
"Please hurry.
We are taking off the
moment you are ready."

Citan
"I am sorry.
I did not want to say
anything until I was sure.
I was on a secret mission
by orders of Emperor Cain
to monitor Fei.
He ordered me to determine
whether Fei would be a
threat to the world or not.
'The Contact'...
That is what the Emperor
calls Fei..."

Citan
"The emotional portion of
Fei's present personality
was sealed up by...
...his father through
some method...
And now with the cleared
foundation of Id's
personality... In computer
terms...
...it is like constructing
a mock personality on top
of the compatible portion
of the OS.
That is the reason Fei has
no memory of his past.
Those 10 or so years of
memories are under the
supervision of Id.
As long as Id does not
willingly hand over the
memories...
There is no way for Fei
to know since he did not
even exist before the
time Id was sealed up.
The present Fei's
personality is an
underdeveloped one which
was built upon within... 
...the 3 years of living in
Lahan, studying and
acquiring other people's
reactions.
Hence, he does not know how
to fully cope with sudden
or emotional situations.
Elly, you are the one who
has spent the most time
with Fei so I would assume
you would understand this.
Were there not times when
he would be psychologically
unstable?
For example, he would be
manicly depressive and then
have sudden fits of
rage..."

Citan
"That is not what I am
saying. The present Fei
is one single personality.
It is just that structure-
wise, his personality was
constructed on top of
Id's...
...hence placing Fei at a
lower hierarchy.
That is why when Id is
active, Fei has no
recollection of it."

Citan
"Yes, if it were only Id
and Fei. But that does not
seem to be the case.
Id only manifests when
Fei's mental energy is in
a weakened state.
It is a mystery in itself
that the lower level
personality of Fei...
...has any control over
the upper level
personality of Id.
It is obvious that there
exists a third personality.
Id calls this existence
the coward.
In my observation, this
coward may be the
fundamental personality
of Fei.
In other words, Id's
manifestation is not
controlled by Fei...
...but is controlled by
the personality known
as the coward."

Citan
"At the same time Id 
resents this coward, he
also obviously fears it.
From a certain point of
view, this coward is the
one assisting in keeping
the present Fei in control.
I do not know the reason
why this third personality,
excuse me...
...Fei's fundamental
personality does not come
out...
If this one awakens, it
will become one with Id.
...In other words, there
is a possibility that the
complete original
personality...
...may be restored."

Citan
"Probably. But I do not
know how to awaken it.
Before I had the
opportunity, Id disappeared
and he has been like that
since.
Basically, as long as
nothing happens to Fei that
would challenge his
existence...
...Fei can be himself.
But his surroundings do
not allow him that
opportunity.
It would be best for him
to live in a place that
is peaceful..."

Jessie
"Go get'em guys."

Jessie
"Yeah, right on!
Go for it young'uns!
We're depending on you.
Especially since my life
also depends on it.
I have no intentions of
kickin' the bucket here."

Jessie
"Alright alright, I
know."

Jessie
"Why can't you be
more nicer?"

Jessie
"An unidentified giant
Gear...?
It can't be..."

Jessie
"Then his present
personality is but only a
temporary one?"

Jessie
"Then that means he might
eventually be overtaken
by Id?"

Jessie
"...Then that means,
what?"

Jessie
"Is that for sure?"

Maria
"Your Majesty...!"

Fei and the guys had
Gaspar remove a part of
the Limiter inserted in
their genes.

Yes yes, and then...
Chu-Chu and her friends
got together and rejoiced
over their safety...
It was natural for them
to have a party, and their
sweet, dangerous night
went on and on...
just like a
never-ending dream...

No, let's not...
It's a whole other

Uh hmmm!"

What about Balthasar,

Zephyr
"Just as I thought..."

Zephyr
"She...was the same as
Sophia?"

Wiseman
"It's a matter of course.
But the girl doesn't 
intend to ride it...
Just like 'her'.
She knows it
unconsciously. The
existence within
her..."

Wiseman
"..."

Wiseman
"No, I don't mind.
I'm not 'him'."

Gaspar
"No, I haven't seen
them ever since...
Besides, your Majesty...
I came here to watch
over them so that they
do not make the same
foolish mistakes again."

Gaspar
"Well then, I'll go take
a look at their Limiters."

Your Majesty, the Omnigear
underground is moving!!
The girl named Elly was
nearby and it reacted to
her!!

Fei
"That's a rather old
picture. Is it a picture
of a family?
Parents, a girl and a
younger brother...
Everyone's seems to be
smiling happily."

Fei
"It's an old picture...
It looks like a picture of
Queen Zephyr's family.
Fine looking parents
and...Is that her brother
next to the Queen...?
Everyone is smiling.
Only the Queen hasn't
changed...for 500
years..."

They still haven't gone

But, through genetic

Probably one of the
survivors that had their
Limiters removed by the
wisemen from Shevat.
Intriguing... You'd make
an excellent guinea pig.
I'll use you for many
experiments!"

Maria
"No Chu-Chu!
Don't!"

Maria
"Are you finished talking
to the Queen?
What do you all plan on
doing...? Are you going to
fight alongside the people
of Shevat against Solaris?"

Maria
"Everyone is searching for
a reason to live, a reason
to fight.
To understand better the
meaning of death...
However, that is something
we must find on our own,
and make it our own...
That is what my grandfather
said. Though I don't
understand what he meant
by it..."

Maria
"It's already been 5 years
since my grandfather
brought me to Shevat.
Grandfather and the Queen
always told me not to leave
Shevat. That I must not go
to Solaris alone...
There's no way I could
lose to any other Gear in
my Seibzehn...
There's no way...!
I'll step on all those
Solarians with
Seibzehn... Beat them
down, beat them all down!!"

Maria
"Why does grandfather and
the Queen stop me?
Don't they care what
happens to father...? Are
they just going to stand by
and watch him die?
I can't forgive those
people who tortured father,

Fei
"..."

Elly
"..."

Bart
"What!?
Collecting combat data!?
Then, this war that's
lasted for hundreds of
years on the Ignas
continent...
It was just a farce 
plotted by Solaris!?"

Rico
"...I see...that's how
it was."

Billy
"The 'Ethos'...
supervised...?
The land dwellers...like
domestic animals...?
Then I was..."

The Limiter restrains the
Lambs' abilities. But there
may be a way to remove it.
Taura Melchior, he used
to be one of the three 
sages of Shevat.
He must know a way to
remove the Limiter.

The scientists of Solaris
had bitter experiences in
the revolt by the Lambs
500 years ago. 
So they decided to do
some work on the Lambs.
They inserted various
Limiters so that they would
never be able to revolt.
For the past 500 years,
Solaris controlled the
Lambs' consciousness,
behavior and all.
Naturally, Lambs don't
know anything about it.
That makes it even more
unforgivable!! Although
it's highly efficient...

This land is a testing
ground for Solaris.
Their objectives are
genetic engineering,
crossbreeding, and mind
control...
They want to collect data
for the newly created 
organisms and general 
combat data.
Lambs are mere livestock
to be raised for Solaris'
purposes.
The 'Ethos' was
established mainly to
control the Lambs.

It's not a farce.
To them, it's an important
simulation under strict
restrictions.
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

They're not doing this
for fun, either.
It's an important
simulation.
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

You land dwellers better
think seriously about it.
The Lambs'll continue to
be Solaris' guinea pigs
unless someone stops them.

The whereabouts of the three
sages, Melchior, Balthasar
and Gaspar have not been
known since the great war.
There's even a rumor that
they lost faith in humans
because of the tragedy in
Nisan.
Solaris' activities have
increased once again...
I wonder where they are
and what they're up to.

A man named Krelian was
the mastermind behind
the planting of the
Limiter in the Lambs.
He was originally a Lamb.
He learned molecular
engineering from the sage,
Melchior, personally.
But he misused it for
such a terrible act!
An unbelievable monster!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1526
----------------------------------------------------------------------

That is Lacan...
No, the dark one.
Grahf's second advent!
We must restrain and seal
him up otherwise we don't
know what may occur!

Zephyr
"Cease this at once!
May we at least wait for
Wiseman to return before
we make any resolutions?"

Although a tactician, why
do you place so much
importance on him?
I have been silent all this
time since Khan's death,
since he was directly
recruited by the Queen.
However, I question why you
would use such a person
whose principles lack any
understanding of sacrifice?

Zephyr
"Well, that is..."

You must look at reality!
The existence of that
power!

Bart
"Hold on, hold on.
What's this Grahf's
second advent?"

The Day of the Collapse
was brought upon by Grahf.
Grahf manipulated Diabolos
into destroying this world.
And that power within Id is
far too similar to Grahf's.
We cannot allow such a
hazard to be set free.
We ought to immediately
freeze him in carbonite.
Otherwise, expect the
worst at any moment...

Elly
"No...!
But isn't the present
Fei the real Fei?
If that's the case,
then why..."

But he is still far too
dangerous! Think about it.
He single-handedly
annihilated the Solaris
capital!
We can't set him free!

Jessie
"Not only that.
In the past, there were
countless other cities
that were destroyed by Id.
I don't know their
intentions, but Grahf
and Krelian were always
involved somehow.
And one of those incidents
was Elru.
It was Dominia's homeland.
Solaris' purging of the
rebelling city of Elru was
done through the use of Id.
To test his capabilities.
As a result, not only was
Elru taken down, all the
Solaris units present
were wiped out..."

Bart
"He's responsible for
the Ygg's...and our..."

Rico
"So he was the one who
killed my subordinates
in the sewers..."

Elly
"What's wrong with you all?
Aren't we supposed to be
his friends!?"

Citan
"It appears everyone else
is in agreement... The
risks are just too great."

Elly
"Citan!?
No...
That is terrible!"

Zephyr
"..."

It's decided then.
He will be scheduled for
carbon freezing, tomorrow.

That which the Gazel Ministry
of Solaris desperately seeks...
is the 12 Anima Relics created
by god's wisdom.
The merging of an Anima Relic
and a Gear can produce an 
Omnigear...
But, the subjects must be in
suitable synchronization or
else the transformation will
not occur.
Some of the Anima Relics have
been discovered, but there are
still more left undiscovered,
sleeping deep in the earth.
Even we have been devoting
much to the search...
but, to no avail...

The power of the Omnigears
was so great that they could
even hold back Diabolos'
collapse 500 years ago.
If any more of these fall
into the hands of the
enemy...
Our future and even those
of the land dwellers will
be...!!
I implore you, land dwellers!
We require your assistance.
Shevat must collect the
remaining Anima Relics,
by any means necessary...!

Hmhmm...
So the Anima Relics were
created by god's wisdom.
I wonder if that is
truly the case...

All in all, that unit was
meant to merge with
something inorganic.
That would be the proper
assumption...

It is foolish of humans
chu try chu depend on
such things...

Oh my, I've said chu much.
Forget what I said.

Uh, and, yeah...the relic,
relic... I wonder where the
little Anima Relic went...

Bart
"Roni Fatima?
Isn't that my ancestor?
So you're saying my
ancestor, Roni, fought
alongside Queen Zephyr
against Solaris...?
Hmm..."

At one point, Solaris and
its Gazel Ministry made up
of 12 elders...
...dominated the world
with more military might
than they have presently.
The people on the land were
treated like slaves...
If any of them resisted,
they were quickly and
mercilessly dealt with.
They treated the people as
if they weren't living
beings.
Eventually, people on the
surface began to rebel from
all parts and ultimately...
...led to the Solaris-Shevat
War of 500 years ago.

The great war that unfolded
between Solaris and Shevat,
500 years ago...
It was a heroic battle,
with the freedom and
independence of the land
dwellers at stake...
The rebel army, which
centered around Shevat...
...was successful at
attacking the inner citadel
of Solaris, but only with
tremendous sacrifices...
However, before we almost
made it, the unthinkable
happened...
A new enemy appeared that
even Solaris had not
anticipated.
That was when the nightmare
began. The nightmare never
seen before.
A nightmare that we pray we
would never have to see
again...

Diabolos...
The sudden appearance of the
mysterious army put a full
stop to the battle between
the humans, 500 years ago.
Those angels of death,
utterly unrivaled, with no
fear or mercy...
Their only intention was to
eradicate all life on this
planet.
Even Solaris' proudest
Gear battalions were
mere flies to them.
Nothing stopped them as
they indiscriminately
slaughtered and trampled
upon countless lives.
At that time, people were
certain that the end of the
world was approaching...
Dominated by feelings of
constant fear and
hopelessness, it was a
dreadful life...

The reason mankind was able
to make it through and
survive certain death,
500 years ago...
...was because the power
of these giants created
through god's wisdom.
Roni Fatima and the other
young fighters piloted
these giants and destroyed
the heart of Diabolos.
Seeing an opportunity to
counterattack, mankind
desperately stood up
against Diabolos...
...and successfully
annihilated them.
Roni Fatima, Queen Zephyr
and the rest of the young
ones put their lives on the
line and won back...
...the future for this
world.

Those giants which fought
long ago to save us. An
existence which surpasses
all other Gears.
They are the legendary
'Omnigears'.
One of them is the treasure
of the Aveh royal family...
...which is currently
resting somewhere within
the continent of Ignas.
But, I can't guarantee
that.

After the war and the
collapse of Diabolos,
similarly to the land
dwellers...
...the heavily beaten
Solaris forces began to
pull back and return to
their home country...
...taking along with them
vast numbers of land
dwellers as slaves.
We couldn't stop them.
The only way for the war
torned land dwellers to
survive was to depend on
Solaris...
After the brief moment of
hope, Solaris once again
began to reign over our
lives...
A cold and harsh era had
begun.
500 years have past and
their reign still
continues...
No one knows how long
this is going to last...

Surviving through the great
war of 500 years ago and
the Diabolos Collapse...
...we and the rest of the
our comrades secluded
ourselves on Shevat.
At the time, Shevat was
being constructed at the
tip of Babel Tower...
...but we were able to
escape to the sky before
Solaris once again ascended
to power over the land.
Since then, we've been
wandering the skies, while
overlooking the activities
of the land below.

You're probably already
aware of this...
...but this Shevat is
protected by a special
gate made possible by
an ancient technology.
Even Solaris cannot break
this barrier. Because of
that, we were able to avoid
being invaded to this day.
But even with that, we
don't have the power to
attack Solaris either...
It's a stalemate.
Basically, we've just been
glaring at each other.

After the war, Solaris
used a gate, like ours,
to separate itself from
the surface.
And then, they erased all
memory of their existence
from the surface dwellers.
Due to this, the surface
dwellers are still not
aware that they've been
secretly dominated by
Solaris all along.
To be born into a false
reality, to grow up in it,
and to die in it...without
ever approaching the truth.
...That is the life of a
surface dweller.

Oh, and you are...?
I feel like I've met you
before...
Hmm...you resemble Kahn,
the one who taught us the
art of fighting.
Nobody knows his
whereabouts after he went
down to the surface on
the Queen's mission...
I doubt something bad
happened to him considering
his skills.
But, I wonder where he is?

You just arrived from
the surface, didn't
you?
I've heard about you.
They say you saved our
colleague captured by the
'Ethos'. Thank you very
much for that.

I wish they'd give me a
mission! 
I'd teach those
Solarians a lesson...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1532
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ahh...I see,
so you're the son of Kahn.
Have you met Queen Zephyr
yet?
She still can't forget
about the tragedy in Nisan
during the great war, 500
years ago. Even though
it's not her fault...
I assume she can't forgive
herself for betraying and
abandoning her fellow 
members though she had no
knowledge of what was
going on...

Oh, I may have said too
much. I'm not supposed to
know anything. Anyhow,
keep up the good work in
overthrowing Solaris,
young man!

Keep it up the good work
in overthrowing Solaris.
I'm counting on you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maria's father, Doctor
Nikolai, was captured by
Solaris and nothing has
been heard from him since.
In any case, I'm sure he's
being forced to do research
on Gears...
If they develop 
Seibzehn further into
a new Gear weapon, and start
mass-producing them...
Well, to say the least,
it would be more than we
could ever handle...

Balthasar brought Maria to
Shevat about 5 years ago,
along with that
Seibzehn.
Balthasar said he sneaked
into Solaris by himself
and tried to save
Dr. Nicola and Maria.
He laughed as he told me
that he managed to escape
with Maria, and take that
Seibzehn as a
souvenir.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1536
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Long ago, humans were with
god in a paradise in the
sky called Mahanon. The
place was protected by the
power of god. Humans were
never exposed to the fear
or danger of death.
However, one day, humans
entered god's forbidden
garden and ate a fruit
which bestowed upon them
tremendous intelligence
and power.
God found out about the
incident and the humans
were banished from the
paradise. The prosperous
times were over, an era of
sorrow and hatred began...

That was the first part
of the legend of genesis
that was passed on from
long ago. They say a
legend such as this
contains some truth to
it...

Humans banished from the
paradise were foolish
enough to revolt against
god.
In order to resist the
power of god, they
created twelve Anima
Relics, and called
themselves gods...
For 10 days, 10 nights,
the world shed its blood,
Mahanon was enveloped in 
flames.
But human strength was no
match for god and the
arrogant humans were
destroyed by god's anger.
Only a few righteous men
were left on the land.
However, god was also
tired and wounded.
He decided to rest in the
deepest depths of the
earth.
God's rest was long.
But eternity is only
a moment to god.
Since then, the righteous
men who didn't revolt
against god had to live
in the harsh nature by
themselves, being in
constant fear of death...

The legend also says the
following:
When the righteous men's
children are born again,
god will awaken from his
long rest and give a
helping hand to them.
If the legend is true,
what will the awakening
god bring to the people?
What kind of existence is
god?

It is not known how much of
the genesis legend is true
...
However, the 'Anima Relics'
made through god's wisdom,
do exist.
Solaris' Gazel Ministry is
desperate to find the
'Anima Relic' and Mahanon,
a place known to be god's
resting place.
If Solaris attains that
power, no one will be able
to stop them.
What will happen to the
world then...?

Margie
"Heh heh, I came here,
too!
The inside of the Yggdrasil
smells like a men's locker
room.
I can't stand it anymore."

Margie
"This country is gentle
and quiet...but I can
sense the sorrow within.
A sad echo from long ago
...way out there...
What happened here 500
years ago?"

Margie
"So, what do you need?"
    Change party
    Nothing

Margie
"O.K.
Well, be careful!"

Want to rest in the bed?
    Sure!
    No thanks

Fei
"I heard about it from
doc.
Id...
...Who would've ever
thought within me, lies
another me..."

Fei
"They say I'm the second
advent of Grahf.
The one who destroyed all
of this world...
It seems Grahf used to be
a land dweller named
Lacan..."

Fei
"Grahf called me the one
who would destroy god
In a way, I can
understand what he means
now.
Though my Id power isn't
good enough, if it has
the same quality as
Grahf's...I..."

Fei
"If you did that, 
you'd be..."

Fei
"Thanks Elly, but no.
Even if I left the
battle field, there's
no guarantee that Id'll
never appear again.
Besides...
I tried to kill you...
You're still okay with
that?"

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"But you're the same Fei
I've always known.
You returned to your old
self. Please don't be
obsessed with it."

Elly
"They're not thinking
about what they're
saying!
They're just confused by
your powers!"

Elly
"Let's escape.
If Grahf, or the war
brings out Id, let's
go to a place where
no wars exist."

Elly
"That's alright...
I don't have a place to
go back, either..."

Elly
"Then you could've killed
me if you really wanted
to, right?
The other you, Id's power
is nothing like that.
But you still didn't go
through with it.
You knew when it was
enough. Isn't that
because your will was in
effect?"

Elly
"If you're to be controlled
by Id and all those around
you became your enemies...
I'd still be by your side.
...Because...
Because...I know it's
lonely to be by yourself."

Elly
"I'll open it now.
Let's go, Fei."

This is where we keep the
criminals in their cells.
It's been said that
soldiers from Solaris were
locked up in here long ago.
I've heard we've even done
many atrocious things at
that time. 
War is like that. It
abolishes good and bad.
One betrays friends,
neighbors, even his own
flesh and blood...
War turns even good, kind
humans into crazed monsters.

This is a Carbonite Cage
that petrifies humans
alive. Regardless of
whether it was only used
on criminals, it is still
heinous.
No matter how you look at
it, they've sure thought
of cruel things.

By the way, you land
dwellers know about the
Nisan tragedy during
the great war?
Did you hear anything
from the higher ups?
    Yes
    No

I'm surprised they told
you. So, you know what it
is, don't you?
Don't believe everything
those old men say.
Nothing good will come
of it.

I doubt they told you.
Those old men politely
avoid talking about it.
Do they think the truth
will disappear if they
turn away from the past?
Bunch of fools!

Be careful, land dweller.
You'll have a terrible time
if you open up your heart 
to those old men.
Just like they did in
Nisan, 500 years ago...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a machine created
to put brutal criminals
and dangerous monsters to
sleep.
It isn't expected to be
used again but it is ready
anytime just in case.
Anyone who has no business
here should leave.
Get out, right now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

That day, 500 years ago,
that woman was definitely
here...There was no other
alternative but to be a
captive...
We could've won, at the
cost of many sacrifices!
Only if that traitor
hadn't disappeared with
the woman!!
The escaped woman freed the
beast. The beast sucked
human blood and ate their
flesh...
And tore the world apart...!

Excuse me...Miss...
You resemble the girl who
was like an angel, and
was sacrificed in the
great war...
I can picture Zephyr and
the followers' confusion.
They were the ones who
were actually responsible
for the death of Sophia.
In actuality, we are still
being punished for that
crime, 500 years ago!
It feels almost
ridiculous, hahah...!

Since then, people have
found themselves groping
in the dark.
They've been atoning for a
crime for 500 years...
I want to you to be
careful, young one. Don't
follow the same path as
the traitor...drowning in
hatred and love...

Fei
"...!?
Yui!?
W...why,
are you here...!?"

Fei
"I see..."

Fei
"I'm sorry for putting so
much trouble on you."

Fei
"Yes...
but..."

Fei
"Oh, you've never met her
before. This is doc's
wife, Yui."

Fei
"Okay!
Then I'll see you later."

Citan
"Oh, it is nice to be back.
Thanks for your trouble."

Elly
"..."

Bart
"Excuse me...but...
who's this lady?"

Bart
"The wife of Citan!?"

Bart
"Y...yes!
H...how do you do!"

We're still running around
in the sky because of the
war that broke out 500
years ago. It doesn't make
any sense!
Why do we have to suffer
for what our ancestors
did? What do you think?
I can't even get fresh
ingredients for meals!
I've had it!

Yui
"Fei...
Be careful...
No matter what happens,
never give up..."

Yui
"Oh, welcome.
You look good, Fei.
The meal will be ready
soon. Please join us and
eat to your heart's
content."

Yui
"Oh? Didn't I tell you
before? I was born here.
After you left the village,
I decided to return to
Shevat along with the
survivors of the village.
Because the soldiers from
Aveh and Kislev were
showing up around there
..."

Yui
"Welcome back."

Yui
"What are you saying?
It's not your fault.
There's nothing to worry
about.
The people from the village
understood after they came
here and heard the story.
They couldn't blame only you
for that incident because
Solaris was behind it."

Yui
"Aha, I take it...
you are Bart, the Orca of
the Desert, right?
I've heard a lot about you.
You've been quite busy.
It's nice to meet you."

Yui
"Have you met the Queen?
If you haven't, go say
hello to her as soon as
possible."

Yui
"There is an intruder
in Shevat? Is it one of
Solaris'...?"

Yui
"Have you met the Queen?
If you haven't, go say hello
to her as soon as possible."

Midori
"...
Chu-chu...
My friend..."

Midori really talks a
lot! It's amazing how
much stuff you have
chu talk about.

We can have a conversation
without talking. Have you
forgotten already?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1548
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We've been flying up in
the sky, right?
It isn't easy getting
supplies. We can't just
go and get all our own
supplies either.
We made it this far
somehow, but if the
situation continues like
this...Hmm...we'd better
do something...

Hmm...this month is going
to be very tight too. We
must cut down on rations
a little to make it...
But everyone will
probably gripe about
that...
What am I gonna do...?

Billy
"This one's no good
either...!!"

Rico
"Is this his doing?"

Citan
"Then, could this
be...?"

Fei
"At this rate, I can't
do anything!
Are you saying we have
to sit here and take it?"

Citan
"That is not what I mean.
Maybe...
Maria could..."

Fei
"Got it!
We've come this far, we're
not gonna get beaten now!"

Fei
"Crap!!
At this rate, I can't
do anything!"

Fei
"Queen Zephyr, we will
also fight to bring
down Solaris.
To begin with, where
is Solaris?
How do you get there?"

Fei
"I see.
I can't leave Nisan
to its fate.
Okay, first let's
head to Nisan!"

Fei
"I got it.
Let's go together,
Maria.
We're friends from
now on, 
you and...
you and Seibzehn too."

Fei
"I got it."

Fei
"Okay, let's go
everyone!"

Chu-Chu
"I'm going."

Chu-Chu
"So...
please let me go along."

Chu-Chu
"No problem.
The gods will
look after us.
Let's go."

Maria
"Th, this is..."

Maria
"Achtzehn...!?"

Maria
"Achtzehn...
is the 2nd Gear my father
designed...
Seibzehn's
sister Gear.
But Achtzehn wasn't
completed...!
Other than Seibzehn
father didn't make anymore,
he was supposed to have
burned the plans...!
So...
Why...!?"

Maria
"That voice...
No...
Father!?"

Maria
"Why that...!!
Why is father...!?"

Maria
"But...!!
But... 
Father's voice...!?"

Maria
"...!!
But..."

Maria
"...
Okay...
I understand."

Maria
"..."

Maria
"Stop it...!!"

Maria
"Why...?
Why this...?"

Maria
"Waghhh!"

Maria
"...!!"

Maria
"Stop it!!
You wouldn't
know!!"

Maria
"Even though, it may be,
I...
to me..."

Maria
"...
I'm sorry..."

Maria
"...!?
What are you saying
Chu-Chu!?"

Maria
"Chu-Chu...!?"

Maria
"...
..."

Maria
"...
Yes."

Maria
"Umm...
Can you take me along
with you?"
I hate just sitting here,
waiting patiently.
I want to do something...
Take me and Seibzehn!"

Maria
"Yes."

People of Shevat!
Hear me!

Nikolai
"I'd heard some interesting
rats had run into there...
Just in time to test
out Achtzehn.
I can take you and Shevat
out all at once!
Hello, little rats,
come on out.
Come on my cute little
guinea pigs."

Nikolai
"So you can be test
subjects for this guy."

Nikolai
"Achtzehn's new weapon...
the anti-Gear Psycho
Jammer!"

Nikolai
"That much time is enough
to erase you from the face
of the earth."

Nikolai
"Humans are an imperfect,
foolish life form...
I will show the greatness
of a perfect life form!
Achtzehn, the combination
of human wisdom and the
strength of steel."

Zephyr
"Calm down, Maria!!
It doesn't mean that
Dr. Nikolai is inside!"

Zephyr
"Maria!!
Get a hold of yourself!
You intend to lose even
before you fight...?
Against the very people
who made you suffer?"

Zephyr
"Maria...
You, wait here."

Zephyr
"Everyone, please.
Be careful."

Zephyr
"...
Listen, Maria...
If the other Gears become
immoblie, you and
Seibzehn are the
only hope.
You're full of spirit...
You can decide what to
do yourself."

Zephyr
"Thank you, everyone.
The generator is repaired
and the gate is developing
as usual.
And Maria...
You did very well.
It is very regretful
about Dr. Nikolai...
Solaris put the doctor
through all of that.
We must defeat them as
soon as possible and
restore freedom!"

Zephyr
"Solaris is hidden from
human eyes by three
gates.
One of the gates is under
the 'Ethos' H.Q. but...
It is unreachable, even
with Gears.
I don't know where the
other two are yet.
Until we destroy the 3
gates, the path to Solaris
will not open.
In addition we've received
some disturbing news.
Aveh has invaded Nisan."

Zephyr
"Their target is probably
somewhere in the earth.
The secret royal
treasure of Aveh.
An Omnigear, sealed up
by Roni Fatima!"

Zephyr
"Your ship has been
equipped with an
aerial module.
Originally it was the
ship used by Bart's
ancestor Roni.
Make free use of it."

Zephyr
"I have one request.
Fei, take Maria along
with you.
This child, since her youth
has been destined with no
choice but to fight.
Until she settles her own
fights, she will not be
able move on with her life.
Go Maria, 
and find your purpose in
life...on your own."

Zephyr
"One of the sages,
Gaspar, has returned.
Gaspar is the one who
taught martial arts to
Kahn and Wiseman.
I'm sure he will be able
to teach you new techniques
that will be of help to
you on your journey.
I've already told Gaspar.
Before you leave you should
learn from him."

Jessie
"Okay, it's ready.
So, the last one is...
this."

Jessie
"What's Achtzehn gonna
do next?

Jessie
"Shevat's Gear
forces...!!"

Jessie
"Beat it!
This isn't an opponent
for you!!"

Jessie
"Damn it...!
I'm gonna mess you up!"

Jessie
"Umph...!!"

Jessie
"This is not good..."

Jessie
"The Gears' response
circuits are acting strange
because of a strong shock.
Don't worry, it's
only momentary."

Jessie
"Achtzehn and its sister
Gear Seibzehn...
So, it's normal there is
an anti-jamming shield..."

Jessie
"More than that...
I don't wanna say
it but...
Your father is no
longer in there..."

Jessie
"I see...oh well...
Might as well expect
the worst then."

Elly
"Shall we change?"

Bart
"You wanna change?"

Bart
"What's with that
creepy Gear...?
Do you know anything
Maria?"

Bart
"What the...?
Shakhan?"

Bart
"Damn!!
This is no place
to hesitate!
I'm going to Nisan!
We can't let Shakhan
have his way!"

Billy
"Shall we change?"

Rico
"You wanna change?"

Citan
"Shall we change?"

Citan
"Well that is fine.
Let us consider our
next move!"

Citan
"We must repulse the Gear
forces and protect the
generator."

Citan
"To do that let us split
into four teams, and
intercept the enemy.
The four of us will attack
independently and defend
each generator to the death.
The other two, wait here.
It is dangerous...but we
cannot turn back now.
If even one generator falls
it is a defeat for us."

Citan
"...
Please Maria."

Citan
"Next, the formation of
the enemy Gear forces.
At Generator 1, there
are two small Gears and
a complement of Solaris
troops...
If you do not hit them
fast and hard you will
get bogged down in a
firefight.
At Generator 2, there
are 3 White Knights.
They are very fast
and maneuverable.
At Generator 3 there
is a large Gear and a
White Knight.
Be careful, the large
Gear has some kind of
special attack.
At Generator 4, there
is a large Gear and a
White Knight.
The large Gear seems to
be a power Gear."

Fei
(She probably couldn't
keep calm just staying
inside the ship.)

Elly
(What's more, I can't
see any civilians!)

Elly
(I heard there is a hidden
shelter. But do you think
they're alright in there?)

Elly
(I'm sure she was in no
state to be able to just
sit still.)

Elly
(I hope it goes OK.)

Elly
"Do we have to
walk that far?"

Elly
"...Haven't you yourself
been inside of it before?"

Citan
(There are no townspeople
in sight, but Shakhan's
guards are everywhere...)

Citan
(It was said that there
is a hidden shelter
facility in the town...
But whether it was safe
in there or not is
another problem...!)

Citan
(It is understandable.
After hearing Shakhan
has his hands on Nisan,
there is no way she would
just sit and do nothing.)

Citan
(Let us just pray
for success.)

Bart
(And I don't see any
of the townspeople.)

Bart
(They're probably in
the hidden shelter.)

Billy
(I don't see any sign of
the residents either.)

Billy
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but I wonder if
it was safe in there?)

Billy
(Margie's the Great Mother
of this sect, isn't she?
After hearing that Nisan
may have fallen into the
hands of these villains...
...there's no way she
would just stand by
and watch it happen.)

Billy
(I hope it works out.)

Billy
"About how far is it?"

Billy
"What? You haven't been
inside there yourself?"

Rico
(Where'd all the
townsfolk go to?)

Rico
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but do you
think it was safe?)

Rico
(Well, what would you do?
Whether you're the Great
Mother or not...
...if your own home's
gettin' trashed, you're
not gonna just stand by
and watch it happen.)

Rico
(Hope it works out.)

Rico
"Is it far?"

Rico
"What you mean...?"

townspeople go chu?)

Chu-Chu
(It's going chu be alright!
There's a secret hole.
That's what I heard chu.)

Chu-Chu

Margie's chu kind a girl
chu just sit there and
do nothing.)

it all go well.)

any civilians.)

Maria
(I've been informed that
there was an emergency
shelter facility.
Do you suppose they
took refuge there?)

Maria
(How can you blame her?
I kind of know what Margie
may be going through.
She probably can't stand
to just sit around.)

works out.)

Maria
"How long does it take
to get over there?"

sealed up. Even I haven't
been far inside of it."

Margie
"Alright then, I'm going
to go on ahead and wait
for you at the entrance."

Margie
"Okay!"

Hang in there, young one!

Yo! Pres.!!

Bart
"Damn, you're funny..."

So the young one's gonna
be our president...

I wish the children
would return soon...
A sign of a good town
is one with smiling,
happy children.

It doesn't look too good
now, but the townsfolk
will eventually return.
Everything will be back
the way it was...
I just know it.

I certainly hope the world
will change for the better.

 Studio 

Fei
"We can't just leave now!"

Fei
(The city's awfully quiet
for some reason...)

Bart
(I dunno, but I'd like
to think that everything
is still okay.)

Fei
(Yeah, I think I heard Bart
say something about that.
So you think the townsfolk
went there?)

Bart
(How was it over
on your side?)

Sigurd
(Everywhere along the
roads was also just as
quiet.)

Bart
(... What's your
take on this, Sig?)

Sigurd
(From what little I've
seen, there isn't anything
much I can say.)

Bart
(Either they haven't 
found what they are
looking for yet...
Or they've already found
what they were looking for
but have just left behind
some guards...
Either way, we still need
to check on the safety
of the residents before we
even think of pulling out.
Hey, by the way, how is
Margie holding up?)

Sigurd
(From the looks of it, she
doesn't seem much different
from her usual self...
But how she feels on the
inside... well, who's to
know...)

Bart
(Really... Thanks for
looking after her, Sig.)

Sigurd
(No problem.
Anyway I shall go and
command the other unit.)

Bart
(Alright. Be careful!)

Bart
(Margie...
I thought I told her to
stay put in our ship.)

Bart
(Yeah, I know but...
Well, she's come this far,
so we can't stop her now.)

Bart
(Alright then...
Let's get movin'.)

Fei
(How was it on your side?)

Sigurd
(The side roads are also
similarly quiet.)

Fei
(I see.
So, what now...?)

Sigurd
(Hmm, just from what little
I've seen I can't tell what
their next move might be.
But, we can't just leave...
considering the residents
were placed in danger
because of our treasure.)

Fei
(Okay, agreed.
But by the way, is
Margie doing alright?)

Sigurd
(Well, about that...
The young master is quite
concerned that Marguerite
has tagged along.)

Sigurd
(Yes, but you know him...)

Sigurd
(Well, I should get going.
We'll coordinate our
moves according to yours
and try to break through
the rear path.)

Fei
(Yeah.)

Citan
(But now that we have heard
and seen so many things up
until now...
We should realize that
Shakhan's existence is
no longer just the young
one's problem.
If we do not stop Shakhan
and his men here, the next
time it may be us who face
such a misfortune.
Let us brace ourselves and
help these people out!)

Fei
(But now that we have heard
and seen so many things up
until now...
We should realize that
Shakhan's existence is
no longer just Bart's
problem.
If we do not stop Shakhan
and his men here, the next
time it may be us who face
a similar crisis.
Let us brace ourselves and
go help our friends out!)

Fei
(Okay then, let's go!)

 ! 

Fei
"Good! Looks like we
cleaned up all the soldiers
who were in the town."

Sigurd
"There are no signs of
residents... yet."

Fei
"Well, let's get goin'.
Where's this mausoleum?"

Bart
"There's an entrance at
the rear of the cathedral.
So first of all, we have to
get on the road that runs
around this town and go in
through the back way."

Bart
"The distance to the
mausoleum isn't that
much...
But, I don't know
how much more there
is to go from there."

Fei
"You haven't been inside
there yourself Bart?"

Bart
"Yeah...
This is my first time to go
beyond the mausoleum too."

Bart
"So neither Margie nor
I know much about it.
Sig and them have already
taken off, so we won't be
able to return to the ship
for a while.
For now, we're just gonna
have to work this out on
our own."

Bart
"We'll come once we
finish our preparations.
So could you wait for
us at the entrance
until then?"

Bart
"Alright...
let's get prepped."

Fei
"But, by the looks of it,
I don't think we'll be able
to find the tool lady."

Bart
"Hmm... Why don't we just
leave the necessary money
behind then?
Sure it might not be good
manners, but I'm sure they
will forgive me..."

"Chasing Shakhan from the
world map to the Gate."

Fei
"I didn't know there was
a hidden path behind the
cathedral."

Bart
"Yeah.
It's usually closed off."

Fei
"So the mausoleum's in
there?"

Bart
"Oh yeah.
If the city's ever in
danger, the people are
supposed to take refuge
in here."

It's just a bit more."

There's something that

Move it?
    Move it
    Forget it

This is it!"

Bart
"We're here."

Bart

Bart
"Hey, lay off and
shut up!"

Bart
"... It's been a while,
so don't blame me.
... Crap,
I really forgot."

    NO! I'm gonna remember!

Laddie!?

...!

Yes, somehow...

Oh yes, Shakhan?
No, I haven't seen him...
The only people that came
here were those soldiers
that threatened me to
stay quiet...
I'm sorry laddie.
If only I'd been braver.

The town's OK now.
Let's go back up!

Collect all your
belongings!

Laddie,
be careful out there!
I know you'll make it ok.
And when you do...
you have to promise that
you'll come out and
announce who you are.
I want to see you stand
on the terrace of Castle
Fatima, proudly!

You gotta win lad.
You've got my support!

Hey, everyone!
It's OK!

Bartholomew,
you're indeed powerful.
I've seen you come and go
from time to time and I
didn't think much of it.
Exactly who are you?

You're going to defeat
Shakhan!?
The...late
king...?

Then you're...

Where did he go!?"

It's OK to go back!"

Bart
"Everyone, I need your
attention! My..."

Bart
"...My friends are
currently headed for
Bledavik.
They're on a mission to
take down Shakhan from
his seat of power."

Bart
"There is a need to
rebuild this country from
scratch again.
I've, I've
inherited that task from
our late king."

Bart
"If all goes well, we'll
soon be able to make
it a reality.
Please, believe me,
and wait for me."

told them that you were
the prince."

Bart
"No, I can't do that yet.
I need to fulfill my
father's last request."

"...I guess there
is no light."

Citan
"Hmm, no ventilation.
That explains the moldy
smell."

Billy
"...Sure is dark."

why it smells like mold..."

Bart
"Oh, they probably have
the power shutdown
because no one's here."

Margie
"We use this lower area
as a mausoleum...
So it always has minimal
power available for use.
But, not even the sisters
are allowed in there."

Bart
"That's obvious.
Practically no one's
been in there."

Bart
"Let's move on!
We gotta get to the
treasure before Shakhan
gets here."

over there?"

Emeralda

Emeralda
"What's up ahead?"

Bart
"So this is the door that
connects to the great
royal treasure."

Bart
"It's time for
the Fatima Jasper...
to do its thing...
Oh yeah, one of mine's
closed."

Margie
"I'm here."

Bart
"Yeah.
That punk, Shakhan
mistook that for the
royal pendant."

Bart
"But that made it
easier for us, so I kept
my mouth shut."

Margie
"Up ahead will be the
central core of the
fortress."

Margie
"It's been said that if
we shine that mysterious
light across our eyes,
the fortress will rise
to the surface.
They say this was built
before the country of
Aveh was founded.
So, you ready to go?"

What the heck did you
just do?"

heading was?"

"So, what're you
doing here!?"

Yeah well, when I
returned to town, I
heard you were deep
in the mausoleum...
I thought to myself...
'Something's going on!'.
I couldn't just stand
there...so I came here.

"It's dangerous, you
better go back."

Oh no, I've come this

I'm gonna stay and help you.

Bart

tank in one of the rooms
we didn't come down in?"

giant tank-thing layin'
'round the other area?"

Chu-Chu
"There was a big round
thing left in there."

Maria
"There was a large tank-
like object in the center
of the other room."

Bart
"...that means there's
only 3 shots left."

Rico
"...Meaning we've
got 3 shots."

Billy

3 tanks...3 shots."

That's 3 shots left!"

yourself?"

Nothing happens.

Bart
"...Not moving."

Bart
"Hmm..."

Margie
"Want to go check out the
great treasure first?"

Bart
"Hmmm...
From the looks of it,
Shakhan hasn't found the
great treasure either."

Fei
"Yeah...
When we were leaving 
Nisan, Bart and them said
they've never been here.
Well, first of all let's
go locate the great
treasure."

Bart
"Yeah...
I know for sure that the
great treasure is
somewhere inside the
mausoleum. I can't
pinpoint the location
though.
So, let's go find it
then we can decide what
to do next."

Bart
"Well then...
Let's do it!"

Bart
"There sure are a lot
of gauges and meters in
here."

Margie
"I wonder which is more
impressive? The pilot
room on your ship or the
one in here?"

Bart
"My ship of course..."

Bart
"Uhh, well... since they
are our ancestors, I
guess this one's better."

Bart
"And you, quit asking
mean questions like that.
Anyway, it's not called
a pilot room. It's the
bridge, got it?"

Margie
"Does it really matter?"

Bart
"All right.
I know I can do it!"

Bart
"............"

Bart
"Yesss!
This is the way!!"

 
"Oh REALLY!?"
                                   

Bart
"Wha?
What're you talking
about?"

Fei
"Quit foolin'!
What the heck did you
just press!?"

Bart
"...Ohhh...
Well, I wouldn't say it
was a complete success...
but it'll do for now."

Bart
"Don't worry!
I've  never fouled things
up yet, have I?
Well have I!?"

Bart
"How 'bout... Ladies and
gentlemen, behold!"

Bart
"Tis that not Babel Tower
...over yonder?"

Bart
"Well?
Isn't it way coooool!?
It floats from the Fatima
Jasper...
I call it Ft. Jasper, and
you'll be able see it from 
far off.
I'm sure that last beam
cannon could reach it!"

Bart
"Well, I guess I wanted to
show you all its greatness.
Have you ever seen such a
cannon? And don't mix it
up with Vanderkaum's pea-
shooter. This one's many 
times more powerful and
many times more refined.
After all, that's why my
ancestors used it for
generations to guard the
treasure.
Yeah, this is the real
thing. And don't you
forget it.
Now as I was saying,
I haven't fouled up yet."

Bart
"So, let's go get this
treasure and go home!
But first, we have to
open that door in the
dome!
I don't think the switch
on this control panel
will do it though."

Bart
"Over there!"

...

Fei
(Didn't you say you hit
the wrong button earlier?)

Bart
"Hey, they all look alike.
Ah well, let's start
hitting some buttons."

Fei
"Whoa whoa!
Is that safe!?"

Bart
"Alright, let's
hurry up and get the
treasure outside."

Well done, Prince
Bartholomew.
Thank you for unlocking
the seal.

Bart
"That voice,
Shakhan!"

Bart
"Damn you!
This was all a setup!?"

Shakhan
"Of course."

Shakhan
"You don't really believe
that the door would open
up for just anyone?
I simply leaked the
information and merely
awaited for your arrival."

Bart
"Crap, so that's why I
haven't noticed your
stench for a while!"

Shakhan
"Knowing your impulsive
nature, I knew you would
come...
But I never thought you'd
go so far as breaking the
seal for me."

Bart
"Son of a...
Makin' a fool outta me!"

Shakhan
"My soldiers have already
secured this area.
If you don't like it,
come here and get some!
Hah hah hah!"

Billy
"Let us begin our
preparations."

Billy
"What is the status of
the charge?"

Billy
"Argh! We're so close
to launching!"

Billy
"I have to do it!"

Billy
"Let me handle it!"

Billy
"Fire!"

Billy
"Missed!"

Billy
"GO!"

Pretty stupid."

Drop ratio in the

Tolone's Gear 'Skyghene'
will surely crush you!"

you'd even think of such a
stupid plan."

Dominia and Kelvena should
have taken over Babel Tower
by now.
You get outta here now!"

"Tolone, Tolone!!
Oh, oh, there you are!!"

Seraphita
"Inverted pull-ups are

But, I can do 300 pull-ups
you know."

Seraphita
"Oh yeah, yeah!
That's it! I remember!
It's tofu soup, right?"

Aren't you the ones who are

There's still energy left."

Next open the sky dome."

"...Huh?"

Bart
"What?"

Bart
"Huh? No,
it's already moving."

Bart
"No.
That's not why."

Ft. Jasper's already up.
You'd better go to Babel
and check the systems.

Don't these guys give up?"

Shakhan
"Most impressive, Prince
Bartholomew.
But you'll go no further."

Bart
"The central area's gone.
What can you do now?
How about killing yourself
honorably?
What a fitting death
for a clergyman."

Shakhan
"There's much more to
the 'Ethos' than you
would know.
We're not a single unit.
We each have an agenda.
We have no need to admit
defeat just because the
central area's gone.
I have my own motives.
And it is for them, that
I used Aveh and Gebler.
Now, the treasure's mine.
I suggest you retreat now."

"...Crap!"

Shakhan
"Hmph...
You're actually trying
to protect the Omnigear?
What do you think one
little girl can do?
As they say, out of the
frying pan and into the
fire...idiot!"

Shakhan
"I'm going to take care
of this once and for all!
That detestable girl has
made a fool of me for the

and everything with her
to the depths of hell."

Get the hell outta

You've gone far enough.

I was worried about you
so I returned here."

it's only a matter of
time until Bledavik
returns to us.
At this point, you have
nowhere to go."

Shakhan
"Errrgh...
It's not over yet!
I've still got Margie.
For now, she'll once
again be my hostage
until I get that
Omnigear."

"Damn, it won't open!
It's locked on the inside."

Can this structure move?"

Citan
"We should all go!"

Citan
"Yes!"

Billy
"...This!"

Billy
"But... it looks
like Bart's Gear."

Billy
"So it's sealed..."

Billy
"I must get this thing
out. What am I
going to do?"

"You...said it would
show itself above if it
read the eyes...
You think this structure
can move?"

Billy
"We should go!"

Billy
"Yeah!"

Rico
"...Incredible!"

Rico
"Hey... doesn't
this look a lot like
yours?"

Rico
"Yeah, the drive unit's
locked..."

Rico
"How am I gonna get this
sucker out?"

Rico
"Didn't you...say that
it would show itself above
if it read the eyes...
You think this structure
can move?"

Rico
"Hey, we're going!"

Rico
"Yeah!"

Maria
"...What an impressive
machine!"

Maria
"It kinda feels like your
machine, Bart."

Maria
"Is there anything else
we should do?"

Maria
"We're going to let him
out, right?"

Maria
""Earlier... you
said that it would appear
above if it read the eyes...
You think this structure
might be able to move?"

Maria
"Let's go!"

Maria
"We're going!"

Chu-Chu
"Waaahaaaooow!
This is chu impressive!"

Chu-Chu
"It sure looks like
Bart's Gear!"

Chu-Chu
"The ancestors haven't
given us permission chu!"

Chu-Chu
"Now, chu let chu out."

Chu-Chu
"You said before...
'it shall appear above 
if it reads the eyes'...
Are you thinking that
this structure can move?"

Chu-Chu
"We're going chu!"

Chu-Chu
"Go!"

Emeralda
"...!"

Emeralda
"It looks like Bart's Gear."

Emeralda
"There're still some
active locks..."

Emeralda
"Next, I guess it's going
out."

Emeralda
"Doesn't this fly?"

Emeralda
"Let's go!"

Emeralda
"Uh huh!"

Bart
"Huh?
Oh yeah...
Now that you mention it...
Well, if you trace my
Brigandier's history, it
was a Gear originaly made
in Aveh, that I customized.
It wouldn't surprise me if
there was some connection."

Bart
"Yeah well...
Looks like there's no power
drawn here except for the
emergency lights."

Fei
"This Gear too...
No power in the lights."

Bart
"Hmm.
The control panels down
there didn't do much...
Meaning there's probably
something around here."

Bart
"Hmm.
There might be something
around here."

Bart
"All right, this should
work."

Margie
"Now, how am I going to
get this out?"

Bart
"Yeah."

Bart
"Okay, let's go back
downstairs and try it."

Bart
"OK, this should work."

Bart
"No. That last room
looked like a bridge.
Let's check it out!"

Bart
"No.
There's gotta be some sorta
control room here.
Let's find it!"

Bart
"Father, looks like we're
gonna have to move this.
Sorry, but I'll have to
borrow it."

Bart
"Margie!?
Is that you...
moving it?"

Bart
"...Crap!"

Bart
"You okay!?"

Margie
"My leg...got shot.
Heh...looks like I'm
causing you trouble again."

Bart
"Stupid!
Why'd you put yourself
in danger like that!?"

Margie
"I...it wasn't much,
I just thought this is the
least I could do for you."

Bart
"...Dumb...
Stupid!
You're the
biggest fool!"

Margie
"...heh, heh."

Bart
"...Can you move?"

Margie
"Uh huh...I guess."

Shakhan
"Minor damage can be
repaired.
Aim for the cockpit!"

Bart
"Dammit!"

Bart
"It's too dangerous to go
outside now.
Can you hold on?"

Margie
"Don't worry
about me."

Bart
"...Damn!"

Bart
"Wha, what the!?
There's no control stick!
How am I gonna move this?"

"Are you okay,
young master!?"

Bart
"...Sig!?
Ya know how to operate
this thing?"

Sigurd
"...What do you mean!?"

Bart
"There are no controls!
What am I gonna do?"

Bart
"Uuuaaaaahh!"

Shakhan
"Impudent little..."

Bart
"H, how!?
How'd it move!?"

"I got it!
Young one, you must think!"

Bart
"That voice... Citan!?"

Citan
"Apparently, the Omnigear
does not function by
mechanical controls, but
mental ones.
Remember how Elly and the
Omnigear in Shevat
responded?"

Bart
"...But..."

Citan
"Margie probably moved it
through the same means.
Young one, try and
envision the Gear moving.
Then the Gear should react
to the image in your head."

Bart
"Now that I know...
...here goes!"

Shakhan
"Damn you, boy!"

Citan
"Fortunately, the bullet
passed through. I will
apply some first aid.
Later, when we return to
the city, we should have
it looked over thoroughly."

Bart
"Good...I'm glad.
When she passed out I
thought the worst."

Margie
"...Bart."

Bart
"...How ya feelin'?"

Margie
"...Okay.
You know, when I
passed out, I still heard
your voice.
For some strange reason...
your cries reached me.
That's why I thought I had
to help you..."

Bart
"...Oh.
We were fighting together
weren't we? You 
protected me."

Bart
"But, is this
really the legendary Gear
in the scroll of our
founding nation?"

Bart
"The way it handles,
it feels just like my
Brigandier...
...Except maybe it's
a little more powerful."

Citan
"Perhaps...
The controls, output and
weapons are similar and
adjust to the strength of
the pilot's mental waves."

Citan
"If so, the pilot must be
skilled at mentally merging
with the Gear to gain its
true power.
Marguerite was able to move
the Gear through her strong
desire to help you.
It was her strength
that moved it."

Bart
"Meaning, I'd have to get
used to it?"

Citan
"That would be the case."

Bart
"Ergh. I already
went through a lot of
trouble getting it..."

Citan
"Do not be discouraged.
We now know that these
Omnigears were used in the
battle between the land
and Solaris.
Even now, the 'Ethos' and
Solaris are seeking the
Omnigears.
At least, this one did not
fall into their hands.
Eventually, you will be
able to unleash its power.
Let us hope you use it
for the right reasons."

 
     "Peace to all those
        who come here.
   Fearing great calamity,
    we sealed this legacy,
 entrusting its fate to you." 
 

Bart
"...?"

Bart
"Something's written here."

Bart
"Does anyone have a light?"

Bart
"This...
There's an inscription.
It's in old Fatima.
......It's my
ancestors'."

Margie
"What does it say?"

 
     "Peace to all those
        who come here.
   Fearing great calamity,
    we sealed this legacy,
 entrusting its fate to you."

Solaris - 1592
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To the next scene

When Fei and the others arrived
at the deepest part of Mahanon,
I was looking after the newly
mutating people in Nisan...

People mutating, one
after the other...

Like some eternal nightmare
that made me wonder just
how long we would have
to keep on nursing them.

Margie
"Are you okay?"

Margie
"You haven't had
any rest have you?
I can handle things
on my own for a while.
Why don't you go out
for a walk?"

Elly
"Thank you.
But I'll be alright.
I'd rather keep busy
so that I won't worry
about things too much."

Margie
"Is that it?"

Margie
"Hey!
Elly, what's that?"

Elly
"This?"

Margie
"Can I see it?"

Margie
"Just as I thought...
It's the Pendant of Nisan.
But, why do you have it,
Elly?"

Elly
"It's Fei's. I'm holding
on to it for him...
But...
It feels as if I have
always worn it..."

Margie
"Hmm..."

Margie
"When you wear that,
you look even more
like Sophia!"

Elly
"Really? Hmm...
Flattery won't get you
anything, you know?
Anyway, we need to hurry up
and test the new mutation
suppressant assembler on
those other people there.
We can't afford to have
them change any further."

Elly
"Ah!"

Elly
"Oh-no...
Something has happened
to Fei and the others!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1594
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"I wonder if we'd come
first if we'd have stepped
on it?"

Citan
"Could it be a trap?"

Billy
"Maybe they're trying to
bait us."

Rico
"I don't know, but it
seems pretty fishy to me."

Maria
"Could it be a trap?"

Chu-Chu
"It's chu suspicious!"

Emeralda
"I sense something very
suspicious."

Bart
"What the!?
That hole wasn't there
last time."

Fei
"They're survivors from
the last battle!"

Fei
"Those guys, it seemed
like they were waiting
for us."

Bart
"Regardless, we gotta go
on! It's going to be an
eternal embarrassment if
we let'em get away!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1596
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"Hold on!
Isn't this the barrier
generator we heard about
in Shevat!?"

Elly
"??
Something's not right."

Elly
"It's falling apart.
We need to get out!!"

Citan
"Could this be the barrier
generator we heard about
in Shevat!?"

Citan
"Something is not quite
right."

Citan
"It is collapsing.
We must leave at once!!"

Billy
"Could this possibly be
the machine that makes
the barrier we heard
about in Shevat!?"

Billy
"Don't you think
something's wrong?"

Billy
"It's coming down.
We must escape!!"

Rico
"Hey, isn't this the
machine that generated
the barrier we heard
about in Shevat!?"

Rico
"What the!?"

Rico
"Not good!
We better bail out
now!!"

Chu-Chu
"Isn't that the whachama-
callit machine the people in
Shevat were talking about!?"

Chu-Chu
"Is something wrong?"

Chu-Chu
"We have chu run!!"

Emeralda
"This...Isn't this the
gate?"

Emeralda
"Something... wrong?"

Emeralda
"Let's go back!!"

Maria
"Might this be the
barrier generator
Zephyr was talking
about!?"

Maria
"???"

Shakhan
"This can't be!?
This is ridiculous!?
It should be able to pull
an adequate amount of
energy from the gate!
There shouldn't have been
any problems in the design.
Why!?
Why doesn't it move?"

Shakhan
"Wha, Who!"

Shakhan
"Power?
What kind of power!?
I have the power of the
gate! As long as I get
this machine to move!!"

Shakhan
"What are you saying?
Superficial power?"

Shakhan
"Ghunnnuuuaaaaaahh..."

Grahf
"My fist is the divine
breath!"

Grahf
"Blossom, o fallen seed,
and draw upon thy hidden
powers!!"

Grahf
"Grant unto thee the
power of the glorious
'Mother of Destruction'!"

Grahf
"I am Grahf, the seeker
of power. Doth
thou desire the power?"

Grahf
"Your powers are merely
superficial. The tools
in which you produced
with your immature
intellect... Now, do you
think you can win?"

Grahf
"The meager efforts of
you land dwellers are
insignificant next to the
true and only power."

Grahf
"I shall endow you with
my true powers!"

Fei
"This is... the
gate generator!?"

Bart
"Punk...
Not only was he sitting
on the Aveh throne, he
also controlled this."

Shakhan
"Exactly."

Shakhan
"To think you knew about
the existence of the
gate...very interesting."

Shakhan
"The gate which divided
Solaris from the earth was
under the supervision of...
the 'Ethos'."

Shakhan
"In the beginning, it was
supervised without any true
knowledge of what it did.
However, over the years,
the 'Ethos' did their own
experiments to reveal its
true nature."

Shakhan
"They learned how to use
it."

Shakhan
"For the sake of
freeing ourselves from
Solaris, we discovered
a new way of using it!"

Bart
"You!
This was your original
intention."

Fei
"He probably entered
through this cavern!
He just wanted the energy
from the gate generator!"

Shakhan
"This can't be!?
This is ridiculous!?
This thing should be able
to pull an adequate
amount of energy from the
gate!"

Shakhan
"There shouldn't
have been any problems
in the design!
Why?"

Shakhan
"Why doesn't it move?"

Bart
"What, did you mess up?
If my father knew I was set
up by a jerk like this, 
he'd turn in his grave."

Shakhan
"I didn't need this anyway!
I'll take you myself!"

Shakhan
"How...
This can't be!"

Bart
"Shakhan!!
12 years ago, if you
weren't so hungry for
power, Margie would
still have her family...
...and wouldn't have had
to live out in the desert!"

Shakhan
"What would you know, you
throne born brat!?"

Bart
"Throne? You can have it!
A king's gotta carry the
heaviest responsibilities
of all!
It's a tough racket!
Something you'd never
understand, punk!!"

Shakhan
"Uwwaaaaaaaahhh!!"

Fei
"The gate's on fire...!"

     Do you not desire the power?

Bart
"Him again!?"

Fei
"How'd he get in
here!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1616
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Is this, 
the 3rd gate......
......?"

Fei
"Who are you?"

I will...
kill you.

Mysterious Gear
"How do you do?
I am a Rattan, one of the
followers of Krelian.
Please excuse me, I'd like
to show you my face but as
a result of the
human-machine fusion..."

Elly
"A follower of Krelian!?
Not Ramsus or the
Elements!?"

Citan
"You are the ones who left
Kahr for the surface...
You must have a good
reason."

Bart
"A follower of Krelian?
I thought you were working
for the shiny gold dude."

Billy
"It's not Ramsus?
But...I get an even more
ominous feeling from this
Gear..."

Rico
"Who the hell are you!?
You don't look like one
of Ramsus' lackeys."

Chu-Chu
"You're Gebler, aren't chu?
Where's the usual cute
one?"

Maria
"I knew it wasn't Ramsus.
Yes...that Gear is an
evolved version of
Seibzehn and Achtzehn!"

Rattan
"Our current task is
totally about inspection
of the evidence.
It'll ruin everything if
someone as dead to the
world as he appeared here.
A person who's calm and
cool like myself would be
perfect for the job.
Oh, but don't worry.
I'll just be inspecting
here. Emeralda here, will
take care of you."

Emeralda
"......Kill...you."

Emeralda
"Ki......m...?
Ah, ah-a-a, I..."

Rattan
"...I see...
Reckless...now that...
You should view it as a
release of...memory,
or maybe a recording.
It turned out just as
Krelian said...
It is a manifestation of
the imprinting.
At any rate, it is proven.
With that, excuse me.
I must report the results.
Oh yes, go ahead and take
the girl.
Use her anyway you like.
After all, she is your
'daughter'..."

Ah, a
aha-a-a-a-a!!

Elly
"Where am I...?"

Elly
"K, Krelian...Commander?"

Elly
"Please, stop!"

Elly
"...?"

Elly
"My other self...?"

Elly
"Where's Fei? Where is
everyone...?"

Elly
"You're planning on sending
them to the same fate as...
...those people in that
research facility!
Doing all this for your
own selfish ambitions...
Do you know what you're
doing!?
People playing with other
people's lives. That's
deplorable!"

Elly
"What do you think of
accomplishing by using that
molecular machine?
What connection do I have
with it?"

Elly
"Mother...?"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"Commander!?"

Elly
"What're you!?"

Elly
"What?"

Elly
"Th, that hurts!
P, please!
Please stop!"

Elly
"Who're you referring to
when you say that man...
Are you talking about Fei?"

Elly
"R, Ramsus...that drug...
A mental stabilizer...?
Why are you so shook up
like that? What's forcing
you to go through all this?
What happened between you
and Fei..."

Elly
"Ramsus..."

Krelian
"I've looked into your
records."

Krelian
"Elhaym Van Houten.
That incident at the Jugend
one year ago...
Case 102. The release of
your latent powers from
that systematic...
...administration of mental
enhancment drugs.
In that instant, your Ether
value had increased beyond
400.
And in that moment, 2
were critically wounded
and 3 required recycling.
Am I right?"

Krelian
"But, this record is wrong.
This wasn't the usual
uncontrollable mental
side effects."

Krelian
"This was caused by the
'awakening of your other
inner self'."

Krelian
"They will be used as an
offering for the...
...resurrection of the
Gazel Ministry.
The same fate awaits that
girl, the artificial
organism.
I've already taken enough
samples from her.
I'm already well into the
fourth stage of my plan.
All I need now is the
final factor.
Hence, your friends are
no longer of any use to
me. They're worthless.
But, you are different."

Krelian
"I see...
So you've seen the
research facility.
Presently, the Solaris
researchers are working
on genetic engineering
down there.
It's just a nest for fools
who've learned the
despicable pleasure of...
...playing with their own
organic creations. They
seek only serendipity and
inhumanity.
That is not my place.
I specialize in
molecular engineering...
Nanotechnology."

Krelian
"Do you know what this is?
A nanomachine...a molecular
machine.
This is the assembler,
which is one of those
nanomachine machines.
It can break down molecules
and atoms and reconstruct
it into anything.
Each of these spheres are
equivalent to an atom.
Until recently, we were
only able to produce...
...materials which were
several times the
size of this.
Thanks to that girl, the
one we obtained from the
ruins of the Zeboim
civilization,
we are now able to make it
this compact and elaborate.
To think that such a
mechanism was created 4000
years ago. It's quite
astonishing.
Up until we discovered
this, the work was rather
crude.
The best we could possibly
do until now was to apply
amino acid solutions to
wounded areas for...
...amelioration or to seal
up any peculiar abilities.
I'm sure you've had some
exposure to genetics when
you were in the Jugend.
Each type of those enzymes
inside the DNA...are also
molecular machines that
were created by nature.
That is, if we are indeed
the progeny of the very
first organism."

Krelian
"Although the nanomachines
up until now could
recombine DNA...
...they couldn't uncover
any information in the
intron which are located
in the replacements...
...of the double helix.
However, the newer
nanomachines easily
discovered this data.
Data that originally
'should not have existed'.
And we are about to see the
results of that."

Krelian
"Hmm, according to the
tranferred record, it
depicts...
...a similar wave
frequency as expected."

Krelian
"And...yes, the Urobolus
Ring...!
That is it, isn't it...?
Miang, and Lacan's
actions...
This explains everything."

Krelian
"Elhaym...
You were the 'mother'..."

Krelian
"Yes.
This is what your genetic
exon looked like before
replacement...
This is the conceptualized
form of the intron which
carries information that
isn't supposed to exist.
Observe. This is the
Urobulos Ring which
contains 'intron
information' which only...
...exists in 'certain
people'. Urobolus...if
we were to anatomize such
a thing...
Wouldn't you be interested
in what type of information
it would have to offer us?"

Krelian
"Elhaym, you are beautiful.
When I look at you, I
appreciate the artistic
aspect of the human form,
its elaborateness...
I can't help but feel the
importance of that.
As if my molecular machine
is unworthy of you.
You haven't changed
'since then'.
Just like the 'other one',
Lacan..."

Ramsus
"Wh...re...?"

Ramsus
"Where...?
I'm asking you
where!!"

Ramsus
"Where is he!?
Where!?
I know you know!
Take me to him!"

Ramsus
"Fei, Fei, Fei...
Fei this...Fei that..."

Ramsus
"Fei...!
In what way is he more
superior than I!?
I will not accept it.
I will not!!"

Ramsus
"Errrrg..."

Ramsus
"Dammit Fei...
I'll show you...
I..."

We are the seed that came
from it, so of course we 
are the best.

The Dedication Ceremony 
was amazing!!

Whaddya think of these
Pogoshoes? 
They were made from
the newest technology.
They don't put stress
on your spine, they're
the best.
The Imperial model is a
super cool ultra rare
item.

'The dedication ends 
with huge fanfare'... 
It was great.

The Dedication is 
starting soon.

'Success of the Imperial
Gate Removal Plan'...
It was the will of 
the Emperor.

'Solaris Defense Field
Destroyed'...
Those savages are really
in trouble now.

Hmm, the newest model 
anti-grav car, 'Roach'. 
The design needs a little
work.

Did you hear the Emperor
and Krelian's broadcast? 
It was magnificent...
But that Ramsus is 
unforgiveable.
Always at the Emperor's
feet!

There seems to be a big 
struggle on the surface.
But it has absolutely 
nothing to do with us.
As long as the Emperor is
with us, we can live in
peace. 
Jumping out of a frying
pan just might land you
in the fire...
That stupid Ramsus hasn't
learned that yet.

Long live the Emperor!!

You can get whatever
you want here.
Look, I should have lost
this arm in an accident,
but with Solaris' biosampling
Look, no scar.
There are none of the 
crimes, disasters or wars
like on earth.
Science makes everything
possible for us.

Whenever I look up I see
Solaris' battleships...
It makes me feel safe
just seeing them.

Just looking down and
seeing the earth I think...
Those poor souls can't
live in this fine city.
Even if they destroy the
gate, it's all a waste
of effort...
Futile resistance from 
those who will never
reach our paradise.

Did you hear the Emperor's 
magnificent speech?
It brings me to tears just 
hearing his deep baritone. 
You too?

The Emperor will give 
the speech himself.
He can't stand to see our 
confusion anymore so he 
went out of the way to 
make an appearance.
We should be thankful.

The Emperor is great
but this is the DK1200!

Yaay! The Emperor!

The Dk1200 is so cool!
They improved it, so it
dances and sings
perfectly.
I can't wait to download
the newest songs.

Two strange people were
just being chased by 
Security Cubes...
I wonder if they were the
ones Krelian mentioned?
You're a 3rd Class citizen
but you wouldn't do that,
right?

You have a ticket? 
You'd better hurry to 
make it on time!

Up ahead is Arbot Plaza. 
The Dedication ceremony 
is about to start but you 
don't have a ticket so...

...
You look rather odd.
3rd Class citizens should
dress more appropriate.

The Dedication is 
starting. 
The whole city will 
be lively.

...
You look rather odd.
3rd Class citizens should
dress more appropriate.

Danger ahead.

There will be traffic
during the Dedication.

Are you Etrenstrolling? 
What? Etrenstrolling
is walking along the 
Etrenank. 
You need to download the
Etren Guide to do it.
Central Control always
has fun things.
It's their job to keep 
the citizens happy.

"Elly, 
they're here!"

Elly
"Dedication ceremony...
Solaris is probably not 
doing so well now."

Fei
"Huh? 
Why do we have to watch
this? 
We decided to meet
everyone. We don't have
time to go this
festival."

Elly
"This is no ordinary 
festival.
The people are disturbed
by the gate's
disappearance.
The dedication is probably
to quell the masses.
We must check Solaris'
stance against land 
dwellers.
Fei, 
we need to get tickets."

Fei
"Yeah? 
I guess we have to get 
some info on the enemy..."

Elly
"Hurry up. 
There's not much time 
till the Dedication."

It was just so sudden."

!!

I'm gonna destroy it!!"

No!

Waah!!

Elly
"It's useless to do that.
You won't be able to get
through without either a
1st Class citizen ID or 
a military ID..."

Fei
"Then what're we going
to do...?"

Elly
"Well we can't just stand
here...
I guess it's going to have
to be all or nothing."

Fei
"If it doesn't work out,
we'll worry about it
later...is what you're
saying? Isn't that kinda
sounding like Bart?"

"Huh? Uh well... 
I've done so much, I'm
surprised they haven't
labeled me as a
traitor yet..."

Fei
"You think it's because
they haven't reported it?
To the Gebler, it would
be like admitting failure
and all."

Elly
"I hope so..."

Fei
"Anyway, let's go!!"

Elly
"Okay. Oh, stay very
close to me.
That way,
it shouldn't pick up

...A purge!

Ramsus
"You...
If you didn't exist...
I...
That's why...
I must...
get rid...
of you...
Only then will I be
able to beat him..."

Ramsus
"Uuuuaaaahhhhh!!"

Krelian
"Of course he can.
He was made to be
able to do so."

Krelian
"Oh, really now...
I don't care about a group
of old geezers who are so
obsessed with clinging onto
their dear little lives...
...that they had to resort
to turning themselves into
data on the SOL-9000 in
order to survive.
That's not why...
Your existence obstructs
me from reaching my goal.
That's all..."

Krelian
"Yes, that's right.
I try to lead the
people in 'my own way'.
That hasn't changed
in the least."

Krelian
"Kill him,
'Ramses'!"

Citan
"Yes.
Twice...no...three
times to be exact."

Citan
"His whereabouts have not
been verified."

Citan
"May I ask you this...?
Why would he be moved to
a place like this...?
Was it the elders?"

Citan
"Then..."

Citan
"It would be hasty to
dispose of him now.
I do not think it is
too late to wait
until we find out
his purpose..."

Citan
"Your will is my
will, your Majesty.
Well then, allow
me to..."

Citan
"Yes...?"

Citan
"...What is it, then...?"

Citan
"Yes, your Majesty.
This is the answer
that I chose myself."

Citan
"Yes.
Humans have the
potential. Managers
are no longer needed."

Citan
"Yes, as you say your
Majesty, if Fei is..."

Emperor
"Has he awoken...?"

Emperor
"I see."

Emperor
"Over here..."

Emperor
"Nay.
They're hoping for a
more immediate disposal.
I don't blame them.
They have a deeply
etched fear of him."

Emperor
"Yes. 
Probably..."

Emperor
"If that is your
judgment, then,
so be it."

Emperor
"Wait a moment..."

"Their judgement...
has been handed down..."

"This is your 
conclusion...?"

Emperor
"Anonelbe...
You think you can do it?"

I atone for my crime
by doing so..."

Ramsus...?"

Emperor Cain
"What do you think
you're doing?
Ramsus...!?"

"That's absurd!
Do you think you can
neutralize my power!?"

Emperor Cain
"Krelian...!?
Surely you're not on
their side now!?"

Emperor Cain
"Haven't you been working
for humanity's future...
for humans to live longer?

you..."

"That's Krelian. 
He's the real leader
of Solaris.
He doesn't appear
in public very
often.
That's all I know."

Fei
"He's...
the leader
of Solaris?
What...
Why do I feel...
Something seems
familiar."

Krelian
"...The gate we control
was removed by will of
the Emperor. 
However, there are 
foolish beasts here 
defiling our holy land 
with their feet.
These beasts destroyed
the gate and want to remove
the Emperor from the throne
in the confusion.
This is a grave matter,
the Emperor's throne
has been polluted.
We cannot rest yet.
Those imbeciles have
been caught and shackled
like the dogs they are!"

     My beloved children, you
     can be at ease. The Gazel
     Ministry and I planned
     the destruction of the
     gate long ago.
     The people chosen by god...
     we, the Gazel, will return
     to god's paradise. To the
     sleeping mother god...
     The time for our
     immortality has come.
     We have opened the the door
     to 'Mahanon'...the place
     where god rests, the source
     of wisdom and power. The
     surface dwellers will no
     doubt use this opportunity
     to seize its power.
     However, there is no need
     to be concerned...
     As long as Solaris has
     this power...

Do as you're told
and get promoted.
What is there to be
discontented about?

All our fates are tied
together...  It's
malcontents like him that
get us all punished.
It kills me to think that
all our work to raise our
block's rank is ruined.

I want to move up a rank
to 2nd Class citizen.
Then I can finally live with
the 2nd Class.

K block...
They're all bein' 
'rearranged'.
Poor guys...and they
worked so hard too.

Even if we think so,
that doesn't mean the
Administration does...

It's best to follow the
Administration. It could
affect your rank, y'know.

A lot of people have
tried to change their IDs
and escape lately...
They usually get caught
and 'rearranged', or 
re-educated.
Don't you even think
of trying to escape.

This is the dust chute. 
3rd Class citizens have
nothing to do with this. 
Go back where you came from.

(...hey...
It's me...me. 
Ready to go?

You've got no business at
the watchtower. Beat it.

What are you doing!?
You were ordered to return!!

Return to your 'shell'
immediately!

Return to your 'shell'

afterall.
Here, take this."

...What is it?

Samson
"A 2nd Class citizen work
permit, just like mine.
With that, you can move
about more freely without
arousing suspicion.
Well, if she's with you,
there shouldn't be any
problems.
Well, I'll be at the

Received a work permit.

somewhere around here.
Find him and get back."

She still oughta be around
here somewhere.
You oughta look for her."

"Yeah?
Well, I won't force you,
it is pretty risky.
But if you change your
mind, come talk to me."

But hey, I know you!

Fei
"H, how do you know me?
Who are you...?"

Samson
"From the Tournament...
Unfortunately, I lost in
the 1st round.
I passed out on
the way home..."

And...?

Samson
"When I came to, I found
myself here.
Everyone else got what they
call 'rearranged'. It's a
cross between brainwashing
and amnesia.
But they messed up on me
and I can still remember."

Fei
"Then what about that
last person...?"

Samson
"Yep, him too.
Died in vain......
One of my few friends, too.
I'm not goin' out like that.
Ya know that guard tower
near us?
I'm gonna go through it
past the 2nd Class block,
sneak into the naval port
and kiss Solaris goodbye."

Fei
"Can you do that?"

Samson
"Yeah, 'cause I got a pass.
They got me working at the
naval port.
I'm only supposed to leave
when it's my shift, but I
'solved' that little snag.
Hey, why don't
you come along?
With your power,
we'd be set!"
    Yeah, sure
    Nah, better not

That's the spirit!

"Fei, you're so careless.
If you're trying to
infiltrate the base,
you have to be subtle.

Fei
"Sorry...
Well, where are we?"

Elly
"We're in the 'Solaris 3rd
Class F block'.
There's around 20 blocks
each with land dwellers
living in them.
We Solarians are privy
to all personal info...
Everyone's DNA structure
is inscribed on a molecular
level.
And even their class...
You know what these
citizens are called?"

No...

Elly
"'Worker Bees'.
It came from the shape of
their housing blocks.
These people provide the
manual labor vital to the
support of Solaris' core.
I took a field trip here
once long ago. I remember
thinking that their lives
had nothing to do with me.
I never thought I would
end up here like this..."

"Which means, you should
know your way around here,
Elly."

Elly
"Vaguely.
We need to escape first..."

Fei
"Oh yeah, where's doc?"

Elly

looking for you...
He may have ended
up in a different block."

"Damn...
We're all spread out."

Citan. He knows this
city better than I do."

is rescued and that will
settle it."

Fei
"But..."

Elly
"Let's go.
Something might happen
to them while we're
just talking here."

Citan
"I am worried for Elly's
family, but...
Her father risked his
life to get us this card.
We must go on!"

Yeah!

Citan
"But in this filthy place?
Spare me.
What I would not give
for my old bath-tub now!
Do you not agree, Fei?"

?

Fei
"OK, let's go!"

Solaris - 1658
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Let's take care of this
and move on!"

What are you doing!?
You are ordered to
withdraw!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1660
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"What're you going to do
to me...?"

As I suspected.
You know nothing...!

Fei
"Doc!! Citan,
why are you here!?"

Citan
"I saw Bart's image on
the Birdvision in the
dedication."

Fei
"You saw that too, doc?"

Citan
"Yes. But I did not
see either of you.
Soon after, I heard
there was an intruder
at the 2nd floor of
the Arebato Grounds.
I suspected
it was probably you
so I waited here.
After that,
I did not hear anything
about the capture of
any intruders."

Fei
"How did you know I was
going to be here?"

Citan
"The best possible way to
sneak into the Palace
is through the dust chute.
And to get back to
the 3rd floor, one must
pass through this
observation tower.
I have always
been thinking...
Do you think you could
possibly be a little more
subtle?
When infiltrating
enemy ground, the most
basic thing to do is to
be stealthy.
With the amount of
activity you have stirred
up, you could even wake
up the dead."

Fei
"Well, I was actually
trying to be subtle..."

Citan
"By the way, what
happened to Elly?
Was she not with you?"

Fei
"Elly... She went back
home.
She really shouldn't have
any relation with us land
dwellers.
She already has such
wonderful parents..."

Citan
"I see...
Yes. It may have been
better for her that
way. Let us head for
the dust chute then."

Yeah!

Citan
"Now Fei, stay very close
to me.
That way it does not pick
up on your presence."

??

Fei
"Doc, hold on. 
How can you get 
past here?
According to Elly, only
1st Class citizens
and military personnel
can pass through...?"

Citan
"Uh!? Well...that is...
P, probably they have not
deleted my ID from the days
I was in the military 
and it is still stored
in the data bank."

My, how the Solaris
monitors are sloppy...
Hahaha...

Fei
"...??"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1662
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, you!! 
Aren't you the one 
from the dedication...?

...

You're under arrest!
Get in that door!!

Hey! Why are you coming
out of there!? Come over
here!

Elly
"I'm an Imperial Special
Forces lieutenant,
Elhaym Van Houten.
I have just completed
the collection of the
special levy of the 3rd
Class level.
I am now in the process
of taking this surface
dweller back to HQ.
Any problems with that?"

(G, Gebler!?)

N, no, no problems...
Please, go on.

Please, go on.

WOMAN

WOMAN2

WOMAN3

WOMAN4

WOMAN5

!%#?&+!

Returning to the
3rd class level? 
Good job. 
It must be hard work."

Working hard?

You've got a lot of guts
going into an area full
of those barbarians... 
Only a Gebler could 
do that.

Yes, yes... Oh, there's
a mistake here. Please
try it one more time.

Not again. This is why
I hate government
offices...

!%#?&+!

This is the problem
with government offices
...grumble...grumble...

!%#?&+!

So the destruction of
the gate was the
Emperor's will. 
I'm relieved.

Working hard?

The one behind you 
is the Gebler? 
I heard the Lambs destroyed
the gate...
Is everything okay?
    It's okay
    It's questionable

Whew, what a relief.

Wha? Now now,
quit jokin'. 
That's impossible!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris - 1664

Fei
"Elly...?
Hey, Elly!"

Elly
"Sorry...
Did you say something?"

Fei
"'Did I say something?'?
Are you okay?
You're zoning. 
Your mind's not here."

Elly
"S,sorry.
I was just thinking.
And this crowd's noisy."

??

Elly
"...Fei, Fei?
What's wrong with you?"

Fei
"Uh, it's...nothing...
But that guy, Krelian...
I feel like...
I've met him before..."

Elly
"Do you understand?
Shall I translate?"

Fei
"Yeah, please."

!?

                              
 
           B, Bart !          
 

Ughh!

Elly
(Don't yell!
What if they find out
you're a land dweller?)

Fei
(Sorry,
couldn't help it.
They've been caught!
Damn...
Let's go!
We gotta help them......)

Elly
(Wait!
He's still talking...)

Elly
('To revive
our progenitors,
the Gazel of old...
The day after tomorrow, 
these land dwellers
will be disposed of in
the Soylent System'.)

Fei
(Revive Gazel?
Soylent System?
What's that?)

Elly
('Gazel' are purebreed
Solaris people... the word
means 1st Class citizens.
...But, in this case,
it probably means 
'the Gazel Ministry'.
Long ago the members of the
Gazel Ministry lost their
fleshly bodies in order to
protect the Solaris people.
I've heard the Soylent
System is an important
support system for Solaris,
but I don't know much else.
Anyway, it's probably a
cover for some kind of
experiment...)

Fei
"Don't tell me what to do!
I'm going! 
Those guys won't stop me."

Elly
"That's why I said wait!
We don't know what's
going on over there.
If we just run out there
brazenly, we might just
fall into the same trap!
The palace is on alert so
we need to investigate... 
We don't even know where
they were taken prisoners.
We still have 2 days,
I'm sure there's a way
to help them. 
We must find it."

Fei
"How do you know we
have two whole days?
What if they change 
their mind and then
tomorrow...
I mean, it is possible
isn't it?"

Elly
"Maybe...But there's
nothing we can do, right?
Citan wasn't there, which
means he's probably
watching the broadcast
somewhere right now.
First we must find him.
He knows the layout of
the central core of the
city better than I do.
So let's not do anything
careless, okay?"

Fei
"Where is he?
We need him!"

Elly
"How should I know?"

Fei
"Don't be a snot.
You haven't thought
anything out at all!"

Elly
"I'm just saying, 
we have to be careful!"

But!

What!

Hey, what's going on?

Fei
"Look!
We've been discovered!"

Elly
"It's because you keep 
raising your voice!"

Elly
"This way!!"

!!

...city alert!! 
...two suspects located! 
...Send the Security
Cubes immediately!!

I'm so indecisive, 
I don't know what to buy. 
Don't bother me.

What? They don't have any
Imperial model pogoshoes?
I want them so badly too!

Sir, I'm sorry. We just
sold the last pair.

Waagghh!!

Wow, the Imperial model...

I want the Imperial 
model too!!

Service in Solaris is 
great, no matter how big
something is, it's always
there when you get home.

This 'Imperial model' is
pretty nice!

Fei
"Doesn't that say 
'Impaired Model'?"

Huh?
Wow, it does! 
It must be a fake!

There's so many Imperial
models out now.
It's a limited edition, 
so I gotta buy it!"

Wow, you got me that
Battling Alloy!! 
When I grow up I'm gonna
join Gebler too!

Yay, with this I can 
mash the Lambs!!

My son bugged me so 
much I just had to get
him a Hybrid Alloy.
I'll be so proud if joins
Gebler when he grows up.

    How about that one?

You think so? 
But you like weird

How was the Dedication? 
It must have been a lot
better from the VIP seats.

Huh? You're the kids
I gave the tickets to!
You're still here? You're
gonna miss the Dedication!

I came to see the Emperor,
and strained my back...
They can cure almost
anything but a bad back.
And after putting up with
all that to get tickets...

Hey, you kids.
Need tickets to the Dedication?
Kids like you really should
go see it!
    Please
    No thanks

Received Dedication tickets.

Forget the money. Just
hurry or you'll miss it.
I'm going to watch it
on Homevision. 

Weird kids...
Better take them before
I change my mind.
You can't get them at

Sorry!!"

Citan
"Maria..."

Maria
"Yes,
what is it?"

Citan
"The disorder Seibzehn
caused when breaking the
gate has almost cleared up.
You and everyone else
must leave before the
enemy detection system
activates again.
We will take care of
the rest."

Maria
"Okay, 
be careful."

Fei
"Seems like the world's
upside down, it's creepy."

Elly
"Solaris' gravity is the
opposite that of the land.
We don't have time to
explain, you'll get used
to it.
It's uncomfortable for us
on the surface at first."

Fei
"Hey, what's this?"

Elly
"It looks like some kind
of storage or distribution
center. I'm not sure but...
...it's probably used to
ship off extra supplies,
materials and fuel
gathered from the surface.
These are the technology
and products you land
dwellers receive from
the 'Ethos'..."

Citan
"For now, shall we gather 
some information..."

Fei
"Is this a container from
the transport system Elly
was talking about?"

Elly
"Well...I'm not sure. 
But I think I've seen 
this before..."

Fei
"Shall we... 
...take a look?"

Elly
"What are you saying? 
We don't have time
for that.
We have to get out
of here quickly."

Fei
"Didn't you say we had 
to gather information?
We could probably sneak 
in using this thing."

Wha!!

Fei!!

I'm glad...
you're okay..."

Medena
"The military told me you 
were missing in action..."

Elly
"No, mother,
that's not true.
See, I'm alive!"

Elly
"Mother,
where is father?"

Medena
"He's still at the 
palace. I think he'll 
be back soon..."

Elly
"I see..."

Medena
"Elly, who's this?"

Elly
"What? Ah...
Um, he's from the
Special Forces,
the same as me.
He was only recently
promoted from 3rd Class
citizen.
It's because of him
I was able to return."

Right, Fei?

Fei
"What? Um...no...I mean..."

Medena
"I see. That must be why
he's dressed like a land
dweller.
But, why isn't
he wearing a Special
Forces uniform
like you, Elly?"

Elly
"S, sorry mother. There's 
a report I must turn in 
right away, so..."

Elly
"Fei, come with me."

Erich
"Elly...
Take this..."

Received Army Cardkey.

Elly
"...Father?"

Erich
"To be human is to be 
able to pick your own 
path in life..."

Elly
"...Father."

Erich
"It looks like the
military police are
here..."

Erich
"The Imperial Guard?
Why are you here instead
of the military police...?"

What?

Erich
"What are you doing?
The intruder fled.
My daughter has nothing
to do with this!"

I can't, Lord Erich.
Turn your daughter 
over to us.
Lord Krelian's orders.

Erich
"Lord Krelian? What does
he want with my daughter...
What?
You mean...Gazel's...!"

You do not need to know.

Take her!

Erich
"Leave my daughter alone!
Or else!"

Elly
"Father!?"

W, what!?
Lord Erich! Have you lost 
your mind?

Erich
"I'm perfectly fine!
Leave her alone!"

Lord Krelian's orders are
the Emperor's orders.
You realize what'll
happen to your rank
if you disobey this order?
You'll be demoted to
3rd Class citizen!

Erich
"I know.
But even if it's Lord
Krelian's order I will
not allow my daughter to
be Gazel's test subject.
Elly, go!
I'll take care of this!"

Elly
"But..."

Erich
"Don't worry about me.
Go help Fei."

Elly
"Father..."

Elly,
Where are you going?

Go ahead and shoot me!"

You're staying here!

Elly!!"

Elly
"No!"

......

Erich
"You know how traitors're 
punished even if they're 
1st Class citizens!
You'll be safe if we kill 
the intruders who know 
about us. I'm worried 
about your safety..."

Elly
"You're lying!
You just hate being in any
postion that endangers you.
Isn't that why you didn't 
want me to join Jugend?
You just didn't want 
everyone to see your 
own daughter!"

Elly

"Haven't you noticed yet?"

Fei
"What do you mean?"

Elly
"The color of my skin,
hair, and eyes are...
different from normal
Solarians..."

Fei
"I've never paid 
attention to it so...
Really?"

Elly
"A long time ago, when I
was small, I had a nanny.
She was so nice to me.
But she was a land dweller.
And First Class citizens
rarely associate with them.
But the nanny lived in 
our house and took care 
of me.
She lost her child when 
she was in the 3rd Class 
area...
My dad felt sorry for her 
and kept her under his 
protection. But he never 
told anyone about her..."

Fei
"Why?"

Elly
"My father was worried 
about my appearance...
He had a reason for it.
She was probably my
real..."

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"I'd better not...
I'm sure you don't want 
to hear about this...
Sorry."

Fei
"That's alright..."

Elly
"Now, it's your turn!"

Fei
"No thanks.
I don't have time for
that."

Elly
"You need to relax.
You don't get a chance 
like this very often.
Please?"

Fei
"Alright, if you insist!"

Elly
"You should've listened 
to me in the first place."

...!!

Wa---a-a-a!!

Elly
"You're fine.
Just relax."

Fei
"Wow...feels good.
There's a world of
difference between this
and doc's old bath tub!"

!!

Fei
"S, stop it!
Stop staring at me!"

Elly
"Don't worry, I'm not
looking.
I'm just adjusting it.
How's the temperature?"

Fei
"Hey,
I'm fine.
Go away, NOW!!"

Elly
"Aha, ha...
Fei's got a cute side
to him."

...??

Fei
"I feel refreshed...
Now what am I gonna do...
There's no time to relax."

Elly
"Yes, I really 
don't want to...
but, there's no other 
choice..."

Fei
"You have any good 
ideas?"

Elly
"The network terminal
in my father's room.
He got angry with me
for touching it once.
There is numerous
information only a handful 
of people have access to."

Fei
"So we can find out where
Bart and the others are
located from that?"

Elly
"I...hope so."

Elly...

...

Medena
"Elly, 
I think you should live
your life the way you wish.
If your loved ones are in
a crisis, you can't desert
them..."

Elly
"Mother...I'm sorry,
for what I said earlier..."

Medena
"...I know.
But there's no doubt that
you're my child...
No matter what happens,
you're my sweetheart..."

Elly
"Mom..."

Medena
"Now...
You'd better hurry..."

Elly
"Yes...
Take care mom..."

Medena
"Hurry..."

This is where the
Solaris people called
Gazel live.
Follow me."

Fei
"W...wait.
The guard robot may get 
you again if you go in 
there..."

Elly
"Don't worry.
This is my house."

Fei
"Well then,
let's go!"

Elly
"You're right...
We don't know what'll
happen, so we shouldn't
ask too much."

Elly
"Don't be ridiculous!
My father'd never take
part in such a thing!"

Elly
My father...
did that...
No, it can't be true..."

Citan
"Soylent System.
The organism experiment
lab and its disposal
facility in Solaris."

Citan
"And the production facility
for food and medicine to
maintain the Limiter seal.
Aquvy's Wels Reapers
were also made here."

Citan
"Elly, do you remember
Dominia's words during our
infiltration of Shevat?
Here is the answer.
People of her native
country served as one of
the origins for Wels...
the M plan.
They were used that
way because of their
peculiar abilites.
She is the last survivor.
Elly, your father, Erich
used to be the
superintendent of this
facility.
He was involved
in the research with
Maria's father.

Citan
"Naturally, Erich always
had pangs of guilt.
So he kept as many land
dwellers as possible under
his protection as 3rd
Class citizens.
Then he resigned.
That's why he is on the
administrative staff of
the Special Forces now."

Citan
"Now, get up, Fei.
Get up and look it over..."

Citan
"..This is reality."

Fei
"Huh?
This one won't
open either."

Fei
"What's this facility for?"

Fei
"The origin of time?"

Fei
"It's the data on the
memory bank?"

Fei
"That means we were
living for those elderly
people of Gazel?"

Fei
"You mean those mutants
getting disassembled at
that factory were too?"

Fei
"That's horrid...
How could they..."

Fei
"What?"

Fei
"Doc, didn't you also
find out..."

Fei
"Hey wait a minute.
It could've been luck."

Fei
"Elly, uh, uhmm..."

Fei
"Wh, what...!"

Fei
"Hey, you okay?
Elly. Elly...?"

Fei
"Elly!"

Fei
"Doc... Citan!"

Fei
"Damn!
Got us!"

Fei
"Elly! Citan!
Where are you!"

Fei
"Damn! No good!
It won't open."

Elly
(Why...is the
deactivation code for the
door lock known?)

Elly
"How could a human...
live 10,000 years...?"

Elly
"They're transferring
and taking living data
via memory cubes to the
Ministry so they can use
them to resurrect their
bodies!?"

Elly
"Citan, 
how would you know that?
Not even the government
or the army know such
things!"

Elly
"Come to think of it, it
seems like we took the long
way here on purpose.
There must've been a faster
way to Bart and them.
Also, the route to get to
this block can't even be
downloaded on the map.
So how did we know what
streets we were on?"

Elly
"That's impossible.
First of all, that
partition we took to get
into this block.
That panel was displayed
to be a P4 facility.
Even a high ranking
officer of Solaris
can't get in here.
You think they'd
leave a facility like
that unlocked and open?"

Elly
"And you could open it?
Who exactly are you?"

Elly
"Something's wrong!
You were able to get into
Solaris under martial law,
sneak into the palace, get
through a P4 level door,
and even learn the purpose
of the P4 facility...
How is that possible?"

Elly
"Even father. I'm sure it
was possible you were in
Solaris then."

Elly
"Even Jessie, who was also
in Solaris then,
didn't know the motive
behind the M Project.
So Citan, why do you know?
You know even more details
than Maria...something's
not right...I know it."

Elly
"I'm not done!"

Elly
"I should've noticed
sooner. Citan...
Who are you?"

Citan
"This way."

Citan
"This place was not meant
to be seen since the
origin of time.
This facility centers
around the Emperor and
the Ministry's longevity
experiments."

Citan
"Yes...10,000 years ago.
Beings called humans were
born here.
The first were the Emperor
and the Ministry's elders.

Citan
"Now only the Emperor is
left. His destiny is to
never die.
However, the Ministry is
different.
Once, during the
Diabolos Invasion...
the Ministry elders died
losing their bodies.
Now, the Solaris governing
Ministry exists as data in
memory banks.
Each of their personalities
are bits of data."

Citan
"Having neither flesh nor
souls they are just binary
numbers.
They both exist and do not
exist at the same time..."

Citan
"After the Fall, wanting
to resurrect their bodies,
and create a worthy vessel,
they transferred a research
facility that was once the
Soylent System on the land
to Etrenank.
Eventually the facility was
no longer only for the
Emperor's life and the
Ministry's resurrection,
but it began producing food
and drugs with additives
that controlled the public.
The memory cube Fei and
them were using was meant
for obtaining living data.
Of course, the 'Ethos' also
sent various data to help."

Citan
"Yes."

Citan
"Yes."

Citan
"Basically, they wish to
reuse the useless dregs."

Fei
"Doc, wait..."

Elly
"Hold on, Fei!
Something's not right!"

Elly
"No...
Look! The surface of the
armor isn't segmented...
It's the same as Bart's
Gear Andvari and the
Gear we saw in Shevat...
It's an Omnigear!"

Elly
"Yes. It's got to be
around 3 times as
powerful as our Gears."

Citan
"So...This is Solaris'
Omnigear."

Solaris'
power to dominate
the world?"

"What're you gonna do to
me? To Bart and them?
Where is Elly?"

Fei
"Damnit...
This...
What was I..."

Fei
"Godammit!
We weren't born to be used
by them!
We didn't come all the way
to Solaris for that!
I, we, everyone...we just
want to make a place where
we can belong...
That's what we were
fighting for...
But now..."

Fei
"I... I..."

Fei
"Stop! Please!"

Citan
"Are you conscious?"

Citan
"It is impossible to move.
This machine has physically
cut your nerve signals.
You will not be able to
lift a finger regardless
of what your minds says."

Citan
"Do not worry...
They have their roles...
you have yours.
I simply investigate."

Citan
"So the battle has been
fought...you say?
That was discussed earlier
by the Ministry..."

Citan
"It is much easier to be
given a place to belong
than to make one yourself.
You do not even
understand a simple
concept like that?"

Citan
"Childish ideals pale when
placed before reality.
But actually many are
satisfied with that.
Being given one's place,
frees one from any risks.
Misfortunes may be blamed
on others.
Do you know why people can
not exist alone but only
under some bigger concept
such as a group or country?
People need a place to go
to be themselves...
The more stable it is the
more effective it is."

Citan
"The Ministry gives them
such a place.
Under total surveilance,
there is no need to bear
the risk of maintaining 
one's own individuality.
They simply live under the
delusion of being an
'individual'. What could
be easier?
Facts are facts so let's
just accept them. It will
be easier for all of us.
Resistance is futile. It
only makes things painful."

Citan
"Do you still intend to
do something about it?
Look at yourself...
What do you think you could
possibly do at this stage?
You cannot move.
You could not even protect
your friends who fought
with you, when they needed
you.
You could not even protect
the most important person
in your life, Elly."

Citan
"You can do nothing."

Fei
"Elly..."

Fei
"Doc...
You there?"

You brought about this
spectacle.

That voice is the one
which haunts you...

Cursed, untouchable one...

Oh god's beloved child,
those who prevent our
prayers...

Get...

Destroy...

Burn with god's fire...

solitude along with god."

Elder
"We humans were not born
on this planet.
Long ago, we came here from
another heavenly body. We
are beings from an alien
planet."

Elder
"This is true.
You have seen the various
regions of this world.
Why do you think there are
no records of humans 
before 10,000 years ago..."

Elder
"This is the will of god.
The god's revival has been 
fated since before the 
time before genesis..."

Elder
"We will be one with god.
Attaining a new 'Animus'...
We will once again return
to the starry skies..."

Elder
"That is the meaning
of our existence."

Elder
"That is our supreme
objective."

Elder
"Of course.
What meaning is there in
having control of a planet
as insignificant as this?
God has given us the right
to rule over the universe."

Elder
"Yes.
Only we, who do not carry
impure blood, have the right
to a pardon..."

Elder
"So, we will resurrect god."

Elder
"It's been an eternity
since our exile from
paradise.
If the time of god's 
revival does not come,
we will have to
follow the path to
destruction. But..."

Elder
"Having attained 'Animus',
our resurrection is near...
Next is god's resurrection"

Fei
"Krelian!?"

Krelian
"This one only waits for
the awakening..."

Fei
"Elly!!?"

Fei
"Doc...
Th, this...!?"

Fei
"Only the true...!"

Fei
"Quit... it..."

Citan
"Now, we may take our
time and talk... Id..."

Citan
"...There is nothing
you can do."

Id
"You understand well.
Just as I expected, Citan,
...or was it 'doc'?"

Citan
"I have been wanting to
meet you, Id. I wanted to
talk with you.
I guess it is all due to
this machine which cuts the
nerve connections.
Anyway, what is Fei doing
as of now?"

Id
"Fei?
Which Fei do you mean?"

Citan
"There is more than one?"

Id
"..."

Citan
"Id?"

Id
"The one you call Fei is
asleep."

Citan
"Sleeping?"

Id
"When I am awake, he sleeps.
That is why he has no
memory of what I do."

Citan
"Why does he not know?"

Id
"It's obvious.
He is my subordinate.
He cannot peer into my
memories. He should not,
in actuality, even exist.
That man forcibly created
his personality.
Fei is a tenant in the
room of cowardice..."

Citan
"That man?"

Id
"Our father, Khan.
He sealed up my personality
in the deepest recesses of
my consciousness.
Through some inexplicable
reason, that is when the
present Fei was born."

Citan
"When you said cowardice,
what did you mean?"

Id
"...
Why ask about him?
You think you can do
something?"

Citan
"It is rare to be able to
talk a real schizophrenic.
As a scholar, I am extremely
intrigued."

Id
"With friends like you...
eh, doctor?
I like you, Citan.
But, he is insignificant.
After all, he is just a
failure. A coward like
him does not deserve to
be 'Fei's existence'.
A pathetic one who has
always fled from reality.
He never did one thing
against me when I control
him.
A coward who refused to
live.
He should've been erased.
But he continues to exist!
Why won't he disappear?
Dammit...it makes my skin
crawl just being in the
same body as him."

Citan
"Let us change the subject.
I would like to know how
and why your personalities
were split.
Since you are the one in
control, I would assume
you would know the story.
Normally, personalities do
not split as they did with
you.
Unless there was some sort
of past trauma."

Id
"You want me to talk about
my memories? Don't 
misunderstand.
I haven't given you the
right to question me.
Just because I'm held down
by this machine, don't
push your luck.
If I really wanted to, I
could break the restraints
and crush you.
Don't you forget it."

Citan
"Then why not do it?"

Id
"..."

Citan
"Shall I tell you why?
You do not have complete
control over Fei do you?
Your control of him is
incomplete.
To break those bonds would
require a tremendous amount
of mental energy.
Having used up your energy,
Fei would return again.
Basically, you would have
to leave the stage.
Obviously, the day you
would be able to return
is indeterminate.
Hence, you will not do it.
Am I mistaken?"

Id
"So you know me too well.
I don't have complete..."

Citan
"What is wrong, Id?"

Id
"You forced me on stage.
He's waking. Under normal
circumstances, I would've
been able to hold on.
But I can't. This is all
that woman's fault.
Her existence makes Fei
resistant."

Citan
"You mean Elly?"

Id
"That woman...the same.
Everyone. Must...
eliminate..."

Citan
"I do not understand.
I do not understand, Id."

Id
"You don't need to
understand.
But when the time comes,
just take it as it comes.
Reality and death..."

Id
"I'll eventually get to
you...Be seein' ya."
ou...Be seein' ya."

Fei, hang in there!

Fei
"............
Y...you traitor!!"

Fei
"Don't stop, Bart!!
He betrayed us!
He betrayed us and Elly!"

Fei
"Let go!
Lemme go!"

Fei
"Billy!?..."

Fei
"What...
But doc was just...
Is that true?"

Fei
"Doc?"

Fei
"I see how it is..."

Fei
"For sure?"

Fei
"...?"

Fei
"Wait!
What happened to Elly?
Weren't you with her?"

Fei
"Why only Elly...?"

Fei
"Is that why...Elly...?"

Fei
"What about doc...?"

Fei
"Doc!
A sword...?"

Fei
"...I see...
...But..."

Fei
"You're always so
mischievous, doc..."

Bart
"Fei, you're conscious?
Now! Let's go!"

Bart
"S, stop!  Fei!"

Bart
"Stop! Fei!
It's your mistake!"

Bart
"Hmph...
If Billy says it you 
listen..."

Bart
"Listen very carefully!
That Limiter is implanted
in our bodies.
Right now,
this research facility
is the only place where
we can get them removed!
Citan misled Krelian and
the other guys and brought
us in here to remove the
Limiter!"

Bart
"Yeah!"

Bart
"By the way, Citan.
You did remove Fei's
Limiter, didn't you?"

Bart
"Alright then. 
Let's get out of here!"

Bart
"I don't care what the
reason is! For now,
let's help Elly and
get out of here fast!"

Bart
"Yo! Citan!
Let me handle Fei and
Elly's situation!
Now that the Limiter is
removed, Solaris doesn't
stand a chance!"

Bart
"A...are you serious...?"

Billy
"Calm down, Fei! 
Bart isn't lying,
Citan is the one
who helped us!"

Billy
"There's no Limiter?
Isn't that because Elly is 
from Solaris?"

Billy
"You're right.
If we mess up here,
I put those guys who went
to help Elly's parents in
danger."

Billy
"Citan, we're going to
Krelian's private
research lab as planned.
We'll meet up at
the rendezvous point."

Citan
"That is not the only
reason why I brought
you here.
Those who want to
become independent
from Solaris
must know the actual
situation and
its true form.
Who is doing what and why."

Citan
"Ostensibly,
I received a covert
order from the Emperor
to contact the body
wanted by the Ministry
and send the data...
and if possible bring
the body back.
That was my duty.
As a result, I had no
choice but to deceive you.
Please forgive me."

Citan
"Besides,
I myself had
a matter that had be
verified in this
facility..."

Citan
"I'll tell you that after
we escape from here.
It is something you must
know."

Citan
"...What?"
Y...yes, of course...
That is..."

Citan
"Elly was taken to
Krelian's research lab.
It could not be stopped.
I am sorry."

Citan
"I do not know...
But one thing bothers
me...When Krelian took
Elly,
I had a chance to acquire
Elly's cellular
information.
I analyzed it and found
something very interesting
...Excuse me, I mean...
unusual.
There is no 
Limiter implanted in her."

Citan
"Even Solaris citizens
have a Limiter implanted
when they are born.
There are exceptions for
certain people like myself
and Ramsus,
whose Limiters can be
removed later on through
the treatment such as the
one I did for Bart.
But you must
have permission from the
Ministry to do so."

Citan
"There must be more to it
than that. I don't know
the reason,
but Krelian is so
absorbed by her data."

Citan
"There is still something
left to be done. I will go
destroy the last gate."

Citan
"Oh, yes! By the way, young
one, about the effects of
removing the Limiter...
The results will not show
up that quickly. Already
your physical Limiters have
been removed naturally.
The part I have removed is
the psychological section.
That is...the subconscious
fear and veneration for the
Ministry and the emperor
have been removed.
Basically, you will be able
to battle against them
without any fears or
hesitations.
It is not that you have
suddenly become more
powerful."

Citan
"...Yes.
Yui gave it to me as
I was leaving.
I used to use it before
I met her. For a long time
I vowed not to use it for
killing though.
But now is not the time to
contemplate morals. It is
not fair for me to be the
only 'innocent' one."

Citan
"Yes?"

Citan
"It is in my nature.
I am sorry, forgive me."

You too...are on his
side...I'll never forgive
you! NEVER!"

Ramsus

I've got to get him with

here easily!"

Citan
"Listen everyone, we have 
no time to waste."

Citan
"So that we do not stand
out, we should split up
into two groups.
Fei, you have done a lot,
but I would like to have
you move on ahead and take
two more members with you.
Move along southwest of
here and cross two mobile
contact bridges.
There you will find a
hangar that will lead to
the outside.
We will meet at the
footbridge near there.
If you talk to the blue
memory cubes you will be
able to make contact with
the other party members.
You can thus change which
members you wish to have
in your current party."

Citan
"...Okay.
Please do not overdo it."

we can!"

beforehand, and arrange
a ride for us.
Solaris is in confusion
now, so if I go alone I 
can pull some strings."

Erich

Erich
"Elly, Medena...
See you again."

"Elly!!"

Medena
"Dear...
Please be careful..."

Hammer
"H, h, hurry, run away...
Yeah, run away.
Yeah, that's right!"

Better make proper
preparations before
you flee, so...
Consider this Hammer's
last closing down sale!
     Items!
     Accessories!

Yes...exactly..."

But I can't stop it.
I'm a 'normal' mother.

"There he was..."

Krelian
"What's so amusing?"

Krelian
"Hmph, dont' be stupid.
By the way...
what about Ramsus?"

Krelian
"I really want to say
it's a waste of time...
but, I guess it's alright.
He probably made it easier
to control it...
Nevertheless..."

Krelian
"How can you continue
to fight without a chance
of winning..."

Krelian
"What her true intentions
are...I don't even know."

Krelian
"We're going.
This place will
soon be gone."

Ramsus
Come on, come on, come on!
You devil...I'll be sure
to kill you this time!!

Ramsus
That's it, that's it...
Heh heh...
He came all this way,
just to be killed...
ugha-a-a-a-a-a-!!

Bart
"Yeah, we were saved when
we were thrown out into
the sky.
The rest of my crew were
aleady picked up and
they're in the Yggdrasil
right now."

Bart
"I'm not lying...
We saw it with our own
eyes. The very sight of
him turning into Id..."

Elly
"...
...Citan...Maria...?"

Elly
"Oh...
...
...Fei...?
What about Fei?
...
Is he on the Yggdrasil
too?"

Elly
"Solaris!!
...That red Gear!?
What is going on,
Citan?
What's happened to Fei?"

Elly
"We'd better help him!!
Fei's still there, isn't
he!? We must hurry!!"

Elly
"So he's already in the
Yggdrasil, right...
Maria?"

Elly
"What!!"

Elly
"!?
You're kidding!?
I don't believe that!"

Elly
"Fei...is...Id...
Don't be ridiculous!"

Elly!
Are you OK? Elly!

Citan
"Elly?
Have you come to
your senses yet?"

Citan
"Calm down, Elly.
Fei...is alright."

Citan
"Calm down, Elly. Listen!
Fei is riding in that Gear.
That Gear is actually
Weltall in its true
form after transformation."

Citan
"Another Fei within him
has awakened.
Fei and Id are the
same person..."

Bart
"We're gonna get
caught up in it!?
Yggdrasil!!
Get moving!!"

Bart
"............
...Phew...!
We made it...
...somehow...!?"

Bart
"Wha, what the?"

Bart
"Damn!
We're spotted!!"

Bart
"Citan!
What now?
What should we do?"

Bart
"What!?"

Citan
"Quick!
Take cover!
The Solarian based energy
descending from the upper
atmosphere is equivalent
to a reactive weapon!"

Citan
"...Elly?
...!"

Citan
"Huh?
What... You are asking
me what to do?"

Franz
"It's that red Gear...!!
It's coming this way!!!!"

Franz
"There's someone
on the deck...
It's... Elly!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"Damn... The bleeding...
The bleeding won't stop...
If things don't change...
At this rate Elly's not
gonna make it...!"

Elly
"...Uh..."

Fei
"Elly! Hang in there!
Elly! I'll save you,
I promise!
Elly...!!"

Fei
"This is incredible!"

Ol' man Bal
"We meet again!"

Ol' man Bal
"The host for the spirit
of the slayer of god...
I didn't think I would
ever work on it again...!"

Fei
"But why are you both
helping me...?"

Taura
"There are some things you
just can't explain with
the word...fate.
You're just going to have
to see it with your own
eyes."

Emeralda
"Fei...
Going?"

Fei
"Yeah, I'd better hurry!"

Fei
"Hey! Where are
you going?"

Shevat Emissary
"Fei,
please hurry!!"

Fei
"A, alright."

Elly
"They're catching up with
us!!"

Elly
"!!"

Ramsus
"Slow, too slow!"

Ramsus
"Your performance is sad!"

Ramsus
"Elhaym...?"

Krelian
"Yes. This is the place.
I want you to
bring her here.
She is an important woman
to me."

Ramsus
"Don't be ridiculous.
Why do I have to
listen to you?
If you need her,
go get her yourself!"

Krelian
"You're quite right.
But, can you say
the same thing
after looking at this?"

Ramsus
"Th, this is..."

Krelian
"Your Gear and the
Anima Relic have been
aligned...
This is the Omnigear.
Now, she is
with Fei now."

Ramsus
"What!?"

Krelian
"Losing those battles
against Fei again and
again...
I believe it's because of
the difference
in the performance
of the Gears.
I think you'll be
able to use 100% of it's
abilities.
So how about it?
However, if you still fail
with this,
you are truly 'trash'."

Ramsus
"..."

Krelian
"Ramsus, will you go?"

Miang
"Kahr, are you going?"

Ramsus
"Yes.
I must get rid of him
with my own hands."

Miang
"Be careful.
I believe in you
no matter what others say."

'Fei'!
What a loathsome name.
I worked my way up on
my own.
But he ruined it again...

Ramsus
"!?
That signal...!
It's him!
I'm not trash!
I'm not worthless!!"

Fei
"What kinda...Gear is 
that...?"

!!

Elly
"Omnigear!!
And according to the
readings...
It's clearly different from 
the one Bart's using or
the one in Shevat...
...You think it's the!?
Perfect Gear!?"

Perfect Gear...?

Elly
"Remember what Citan said?
He said that
the Omnigears are controlled
by mental waves.
The power...the potential
varies depending on the
rate of synchronism.
The numbers indicate
complete synchronization."

Ramsus
"Hmph...
I knew you'd be there."

Fei
"Ramsus!?"

Ramsus
"Turn Lt. Elhaym
over to me, Fei!"

Fei
"What!? Why do we have to
turn Elly over to
you...!?
Oh, I get it, it's
Krelian's idea, isn't it?
I don't think so!
You can't expect me
to comply!"

Ramsus
"I can take her by force,
if you wish.
But then,
don't ever expect to be
able to hold her in your
arms ever again!"

Fei!!

Fei
"Don't worry.
I'll protect you."

Ramsus
"Impressive words.
Fei, I intend to
take everything away
from you!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
file37
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ramsus
"This is your final
warning. Hand over
Lt. Elhaym, now!"

Ramsus
"Are you sure you
want to refuse me?
It'll be too late
for you to change
your mind later!"

Ramsus
"Humm... Well then,
I'll have to show you
if I'm boasting or not!
So be it.
No holding back!
And no holds barred!"

Ramsus
"Come on, come on!
What poor form!
What's wrong, Fei!?
In the presence of
my 'Vendetta', your
Weltall is but
only a infant!"

Ramsus
"Incredible!
This undeniable
difference in power!
Miang!
Are you watching this!?"

Ramsus
"At this rate...
And with this power,
I can defeat him!"

Ramsus
"Hm Hm Hm Hm Hmm...
Wah hah hah hah hah!"

Ramsus
"Hyah hah hah hah hah!
Win! I can win! I am
not the worthless one!!"

Ramsus
"It's over for you!
Fei Fong Wong!"

Ramsus
"Nuah hah hah hah! I am
not the worthless one!
Hah! Uha, haah... haah
... Huh?"

Ramsus
"!!
I've even taken out
the lieutenant too...
Damn,
I forgot my orders...
Hmph...
Oh well...
To hell with
Krelian's orders..."

Fei
"I refuse to!"

Fei
"Stop your stupid
boasting!"

Fei
"What are you saying!?
If you do that..."

Fei
"Ramsus...!?
Can't you
hear us...?"

Elly
"...
Ramsus, listen!
I surrender!!
So please stop
attacking us
this instant!"

Elly
"It is me he wants!
I can't drag you into
danger just over me!"

Elly
"Stop attacking!
Ramsus!
If I'm what you want,
then just take me!"

Elly
"Eeeeyaaah!"

Elly
"He's lost himself in
the overwhelming power
of that gear of his...
Fei, we had
better run!"

Fei
"Uuaaaaaahhhhhh!!"
Elly
"Eeeeyyyaaahhhh!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1834
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"I knew it was you..."

Elly
"Fei...?"

Fei
"When you came in the
room just then...
I was afraid you may have
forgotten about me and
everything else..."

Elly
"What do you mean...?"

Fei
"I mean...because...
Elly, you seemed a little
different than before..."

Elly
"Has my face...changed?"

Fei
"No, that's not it...
It's more like..."

Fei
"I mean your atmosphere or
impression is different...
just a little..."

Fei
"But, I felt something
familiar...
I felt the same way when
I met you for the first
time...
Some peculiar feeling
like we've met before,
somewhere..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"Yes?"

Elly
"I don't remember much
what happened after we
were shot down..."

Fei
"It's better that way."

Elly
"But I heard someone
calling my name...
I felt I was covered with
something very warm...
I remember that clearly..."

Fei
"..."

Elly
"Thank you, Fei."

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Taura
"Hey, it's almost time
for you to come back.
There's something
important we need to
talk to you about."

...

Fei
"A, alright,
we're coming!"

Fei
"Well, Elly,
shall we go
see what's up?"

Elly
"S, sure..."

Citan
"Are you sure you want to
go through with this?
You wanted to live quietly
away from the battle
field, did you not?"

Elly
"I noticed myself running
away from reality...
At first, I thought
my situation was
similar to his.
I thought Fei would
understand my feelings...
I didn't know if my love
for him was real...
I might have been desperate
after losing my mother and
father..."

Citan
"Elly..."

Elly
"Despite all that...
I may still love him...
That's why, I want to
see what Fei can do
and what I can do.
I want us to be apart
and think about
ourselves again."

Elly
"I want to see...
how I really feel..."

...

Citan
"You have changed a lot,
Elly.
What happened to you
in the past three weeks?"

Elly
"Really?
I don't think
I've changed..."

Citan
"Yes, you have.
I should say...
you have matured...
...Like a mother..."

Elly
"Excuse me!
I'm only 18 years old.
I'm nowhere near the
age of being your
mother!"

Citan
"Sorry.
You gave me that
impression. That is all."

Elly
"Anyway Citan,
I'm going now."

Citan
"Alright.
I will follow you as soon
as I finish off here..."

Emeralda
"I, I go, too."

What?

I go!

Elly
"Emeralda, I can't take
anyone else along with me
for something like this.
I'll be fine on my own."

Emeralda
"If Elly go, I go too.
Emeralda have to go
with you."

Elly
"Emeralda...?"

Emeralda
"No!
Emeralda go too!"

Citan
"Why not let her go?
I am sure Solaris has a
hunch about the Limiter.
They may interfere, so
you may feel uneasy going
it alone. I think Emeralda
is cut out for this job."

Citan
(...Besides, she is going
to want to go no matter
what.
Take care of her until I
can join you, please?)

Elly
"Okay, you win.
Let's help each other, 
alright?"

Emeralda
"I can do it alone.
You just watch."

Elly
"Fei, where are you going?
Taura is calling you!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1836
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taura...

Citan
"Fei!!"

Fei
"Doc!!"

Citan
"I heard from Taura and
hurried right over here!
Boy, was that lucky.
You were fortunate to have
come down near Taura's
research facility..."

Taura
"Hm... This is no
research facility. 
It is 'a man's hideaway'!"

Taura
"Citan told me about you.
I was shocked to see a
couple lying down with
blood all over them."

A couple...

Citan
"At any rate,
you had a narrow
escape.
Fei, make sure
you thank Taura!"

Fei
"Taura,
thank you very much...
for helping Elly..."

Fei
"Both Elly and I were
hurt so badly...
What is that machine...?"

Taura
"It's called a Nanoreactor.
It is a device that can
rebuild substances at
the molecular level.
Not only can it just heal
humans, but theoretically
it should also be able to
create many substances."

Fei
"Is that the same thing
as that guy in Solaris...?
I mean...
Is that the same thing
as Krelian is studying?"

Taura
"Yes, that's right."

Taura
"I was the one who taught
Nanotechnology to him..."

Fei
"You did?"

Taura
"We shouldn't waste time
talking about such an
unimportant subject.
Looks like her treatment
is done."

Taura
"Oh, you don't
need to come.
Just wait there."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Fei..."

Fei
"Elly!!"

Elly
"Fei...
I..."

Taura
"Ahem! Now, why don't you
two go get some fresh air
outside?
It ought to ease the
shock of the change."

Shevat Emissary
"Fei...!
We've got problems!!"

Shevat Emissary
"Today, a peace settlement
between Aveh and Kislev
is being held at Shevat...
But, Solaris' mobile
weapons are approaching
Shevat as we speak!
Please, help us!"

Taura
"That has nothing to do
with this young man!!"

Shevat Emissary
"Taura!!"

Taura
"You're getting on my
nerves for being so
selfish.
Citan told me about you.
You showed up after
finding out that Id is
now controllable...
Aren't you ashamed? You
haven't changed since
then. You only care
about yourselves."

Taura
"Fei! You don't need to
listen to these guys who
once tried to kill you!!"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"..."

Elly
"Please go.
I'll go to the
Mass-driver..."

Fei
"Elly?"

Elly
"No matter what happened
before, Shevat needs your
help now.
Although you may be saving
some selfish people...
there is still the world
and its countries with
many more innocent people.
Please,
don't forget that."

Elly
"Bart and his people are
fighting to protect those
same lives, aren't they?
So, please go help them!"

Fei
"Are you sure?
What about you?"

Elly
"Don't worry about me.
I'll manage somehow."

Fei
"But, all by yourself..."

Citan
"I will accompany Elly.
You do not need to worry.
I have brought along my
own Omnigear."

Fei
"Your own Omnigear...?"

Citan
"Yes my Omnigear,
'Fenrir'.
It is the same one I
brought from Solaris.
I left it with Gaspar
in case of emergencies."

Fei
"Doc...
Alright. Please take
care of her for me."

Fei
"Elly, be careful."

Elly
"I will."

Shevat Emissary
"We are truly grateful
for your kindness, Fei!!"

Taura
"Hmph!
Suit yourselves."

Fei
"Ignas, right?"

Shevat Emissary
"Yes.
The goal of the enemy is to
destroy the cities in Ignas.
They have already destroyed
half of Bledavik and will
probably reach Nisan in 
about four hours.
Shevat will try to drive
them back with all the
power it has!"

Fei
"Four hours...
That's cutting it close!"

Taura
"No need to worry.
Balthasar and I fixed your
Gear with the nanomachines.
It's much more powerful
than it ever was before.
Why, you should get there
in half the time."

Fei
"What?
Is old man Bal here?"

Citan
"Emeralda is here as well."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1838
----------------------------------------------------------------------

!!

Citan
"Fei, it is alright."

Taura
"The fate of the world is
in your hands.
We're counting on you...!
In the mean time, I will
just watch from here..."

Taura
"Thanks for visiting.
You're looking mighty
healthy.
I want to help you more...
but this body can't survive
unless it breathes the air
here...
Looks like I'm just about
ready to meet my maker,
huh...
Ho, hoh, hoh!"

Oh, Taura...

Taura
"Don't worry, I'll stop my
moaning. Besides, I have a
nice present for you."
 
 Received Manly Mantle!!
 
 Received Goddess Robe!!

Taura
"Was that a visitor
I heard?"

Mysterious old man
"Hmm... He's
finally awake..."

Here you go...

Mmm...

Hmm...hmm...

Fei
"I'm...healed..."

Mysterious old man
"You've been sleeping
in this Nanoreactor
for three weeks."

Fei
"Nanoreactor?
Who are you...?"

Mysterious old man
"Me...?"

Mysterious old man
"I forgot my name...
Some people call me
Taura..."

Taura
"You seemed to have
recovered completely.
Those were terrible wounds,
but maybe your youth and
strength helped..."

Taura
"But your friend's wounds
are more serious and may
take a while longer..."

Fei
"My friend...?"

Elly!!

Fei
"Elly..."

Taura
"Hey!
Quit staring at the naked
girl and come over here!"

Fei
"Elly...?"

Taura
"How do you feel now?
The fresh forest air
should have refreshed
you somewhat, heh?"

Taura
"Anyway...
It's about the removal
of the seal...
I found out it can be
released by using the
Nanotechnology that
regenerated you two."

Taura
"The Nanoassemblers are
enclosed in this pod."

Citan
"If only we could scatter
them all over the world..."

Taura
"There's an ancient
military installation
nearby...
We might be able to use the
'Mass-driver' located in
there to launch this pod
into the upper atmosphere.
Once the Nanoassemblers
are released up there, the
convection currents should
spread 'em over the world!"

Taura
"I wish I could go do it...
but I am getting much too
old for that type of thing.
Then again, it's for your
future. An old man should
not butt in. You young ones
must do it for yourselves!"

Taura
"Here."

Taura
"And, of course,
I'm not asking you
to do it for free.
Try this wrist band
on."

?

Citan
"What is that?"

Taura
"This is an 'Emotion
Control Device' in which
nanotechnology is applied.
From this machine shaped as
a wrist band, nanomachines
are infused through your
epidermis into your brain.
There they refine the SSRI
intracerebral substances,
such as Serotonin, that
control emotions."

??

Taura
"Well, I suppose it's
rather difficult for
you to understand...
But in short, it means
that the manifestation of
your second personality,
'Id', can be suppressed."

Fei
"Id..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Taura
"Well, it's all theoretical
though... Oh, and I did one
more thing as well...!
I installed the same
control device in your
Gear..."

Citan
"You mean, it can
release Id at will...?"

Taura
"Yes.
I called it 'System Id'.
But of course it should
not be over-used.
Use it only as a last
resort."

Fei
"Elly, doc,
I..."

Citan
"Fei, there was nothing
you could do...
It will never happen again
with Taura's technology
though. He is one of the
three Shevat sages."

Taura
"Whether you believe it
or not, it's up to you."

Fei
"..."

Taura
"Oh?
It sounds like
we have a guest!"

!!

Taura
"I thought so..."

Taura
"So, you were the one who
brought Fei and his girl
to me...
I realized it the minute
I saw the two of them.
Why, how could I help but
notice...
They looked the spitting
image of you and her.
Yes, just as you yourselves
looked way back then..."

Taura
"Right, Lacan...?"

Krelian
"Lacan, look at this.
I finally completed it.
This will save people's
lives."

Krelian
"Isn't that right,
Melchior? With this even
Sophia will..."

1840

Dreaming...
 
I was dreaming...
Perhaps it may have been
but a long forgotten memory...
 
A dream...
A memory...

 
Things remembered
when one is asleep...
Things forgotten
when one is awake...
 
Where the deepest layers
of memories
Become the outmost layers
of one's dreams...
 
Which are reality?
Which are illusions?
One cannot tell until
one awakes...
 
Or perhaps they are,
At the same time, both
Truth and fiction...

A vast nebulous...
With no boundaries...
 
An emptiness equivalent
To my own existence...
 
I dreamt such a dream...
 
A long...
Never-ending,
Dream...

'Elly'...
 
It was a time when she
went by such a name.
A time when we had met
up with one another...
A time when nothing
mattered between us...
 
It was better that way...
Just two people,
together...
 
It was better to have
left it that way...

Dreams...
 
A life of a man named
Lacan...
And the lives of countless
other men...
 
All but dreams...

Now that I am awake,
those countless numbers of
long, heartrending dreams
are almost impossible to
remember at all...
 
In those dreams,
I loved one woman...
No matter the day,
No matter the era...
That did not change...
 
Nor did her name...

That dream changed me...
That dream was the catalyst
for me to resolve what my
purpose was.
 
I think I know now...
What I have to do...
 
That long, long memory
of a dream...
Perhaps it was
the memory of my soul...

A dream...
 
I was dreaming a dream...
Or perhaps it was a memory
From a distant past...
 
A dream...
A memory...

Those words I was
unable to convey...
That day...
That time...
 
Those thoughts I was
unable to carry out...
Words and thoughts...
The connection between
the two...
 
Without words,
Thoughts cannot be conveyed...
Without thoughts,
There are no words...
They are both as vital
as each other...
They can never be
divided...
Like the wings of angels...
Like a man and a woman...

An unchangeable destiny...
Feelings one wishes
one could change...
 
Meeting with the person
who would change me...
And watching myself change...
 
I dreamt such a dream...
 
A long...
Never-ending,
Dream...

'Elhaym'...
 
I've always liked that name...
Because, when I first met him,
that is what he called me...
 
That is my true name...

Dreams...
 
A life of a woman named
Sophia...
And the lives of countless
other women...
 
All but dreams...

Now that I am awake,
those countless numbers of
long, heartrending dreams
are almost impossible to
remember at all...
 
In those dreams,
I loved one man...
No matter the day,
No matter the era...
That did not change...
 
Only his name...

That dream changed me...
That dream was the catalyst
for me to resolve what my
purpose was.
 
I think I know now...
What I have to do...
 
That long, long memory
of a dream...
That perhaps was
the memory of my soul...

In order to disperse the nano-
machines, Emeralda and I headed
for one of the ruins of the
Zeboim civilization...
the Mass-driver facility.

Fortunately, the facility was
still active which allowed us
to proceed on to the central
control room with little
difficulty.

Along the way we saw various
missiles and giant rockets
that were created during the
Zeboim era...
They stood like tombstones
of that ancient civilization.
 
It was a graveyard for a race
of people who destroyed each
other over pride and arrogance.

Once arriving at the
central control room,
we met up with Citan
who helped us activate
the Mass-driver.
 
We succeeded in launching
the capsule containing the
nanomachines which would
release the seal -Limiter-.

The nanomachines that were
scattered into the upper
atmosphere began to multiply
and spread throughout the
whole of the world.
 
The nanomachines glittered
in the sunlight.
Flowing like a large river
in the sky...
 
That glitter would remove
the 'bonds' restraining
everyone.
 
It was to be our light of
hope for regaining back
our true freedom...

While Fei and the others
searched for the resting
place of the last known
Anima Relic, I temporarily
returned to Nisan.
 
I don't know why I went back.
Just...I had this stirring
within my heart...that some
danger was awaiting the
people there...

All the people accepted
into Nisan were on the road
to recovery.
There were still those who
were not able to completely
recover, but Taura's
nanomachines continued to
evolve from day to day.
Thanks to the nanomachines,
the treatments were becoming
more and more successful and
the day when everyone would
regain their original bodily
form was approaching.

  A trembling...
 
There was a sudden explosion
in the city of Nisan.
Within the burning fire...
stood a gold Omnigear...
 
  It was Ramsus.
  He assaulted Nisan so that
  he could defeat Fei.
 
  His purpose of existing
  was at stake...

The Nisan and Shevat militia,
even Renk and friends from
Solaris who now served to
protect Nisan, could not
thwart the assault.
The people were evacuated
into the cathedral.
Continuing to search for
Fei, Ramsus put the militia
to rout and pressed on
toward the cathedral...
 
He was...ruined...
He had his mind set solely
on getting at Fei...
 
  I stood before him.

Ramsus
"Where! Where is he!?
I know it! He's here!
Why does he not come out!?"

Elly
"Ramsus!
The Fei you seek is
not here!
So please, stop this
meaningless violence!"

Ramsus
"You...
Yes...
You will do..."

Ramsus
"Come out! Fei!
If you will not come out,
I will crush Elhaym!"

Elly
"Uuhg...!"

Margie
"Elly!"

Renk
"Boss..."

Elly
"Keep back..."

Ramsus
"Not coming out, eh...
Have it your way.
Then from tonight on you
will be crying with this
woman's dead body in your
arms!"

Elly
"Uuuaaahhh!"

Ramsus
"H, how the!?
What happened!?
Why can't I move!?"

Margie
"Elly!"

Renk
"Are you okay!?"

Ramsus
"H, how could I...to
the likes of you...?"

Ramsus
"N, not only to him, but
I am also inferior to
you...!? Me!?"

Elly
"What happened to
you, Ramsus...?"

Elly
"Why are you caught up
with Fei so much...
Why are you so bothered by
who is more superior?"

Ramsus
"I was originally created
to be the intregation of
all human abilities...
...To be able to align
with all of the Anima
Relics...
I was created to have the
powers equivalent to those
of Emperor Cain.
You could say I was to be
the ideal form which all
people strive to become...
However...once he was born
...I was...rejected...
...I was given life in a
pile of trash...
...Born in the dark, cold
abyss of worthlessness..."

Ramsus
"But I was able to crawl
out of there! I was able to
survive on my own strength!
In order to get back at all
those who have forsaken me!
Despite all of that, I was
able to get this far!
I was able to provide
myself with the warmth
that I required to
continue living!"

Ramsus
"But, he had to come and
intervene in my life one
more time!
He tried to take that very
warmth away from me again!
As long as he exists...
I don't belong anywhere..."

Elly
"I think I now know why
you are so fixated with
Fei...
You do not really know
what you should be doing
with your life right now.
You're simply trying to
protect yourself by
attacking Fei...
By attacking others, you
are confirming your own
existence."

Elly
"That's why you strive to
be above everyone else...
Because, otherwise, you'd
be enveloped by a void...
Because you yourself will
disappear...
Because that emptiness
within your heart will
only grow...
Because you want to hang
on to love..."

Ramsus
"Silence!"

Ramsus
"Even you are trying to
take it away from me!?
...That warmth!
That very warmth I've
finally obtained!"

Elly
"Ramsus...
No one is attacking you.
No one is trying to take
away what is so precious
to you...
No one is threatening your
existence..."

Elly
"It's all in your mind.
So don't hide the feelings
that are in your heart...
Don't fear love..."

Ramsus
"Y, you...
Now you...
Aaarrrgghhh!"

Ramsus was in fear.
 
 He feared losing the
  place he belonged to...
   He feared that Fei was
    the one who would take
     it away from him...
 
He believed love was
 something you take...
  He craved love more
   than anyone else...

Suddenly the howling erupted.
Even the people who had not
mutated were being turned...
                   into Wels.
 
They howled out like war
cries, as if to call out
to something.

That was because Ramsus
had been manipulated into
assassinating the Emperor.
 
Now, with nothing else
holding them back, the
Ministry had put into
use the 'Gaetia Key'...
 
The effect of which was to
alter those people who had
been destined by god.

Those people destined by god,
regardless of whether they
were surface dwellers or
Solarians, began to change
shape, one after the other...
 
The howling was the people,
who had filled the earth,
calling out to god.
"Once humans have filled the
  earth, god will awaken from
   his long sleep...
 And the awakening of Mahanon,
  the paradise in the sky,
   will soon follow..."
 
The true meaning of what the
Ministry had spoken, the true
nature of that legend, was at
last beginning to be realized.

This is what they meant when
they said "once humans have
filled the earth"...
 
Eventually, 'Mahanon',
the resting place of god,
woke from its long slumber
and began to rise...
...almost as if responding
to the call of the people.
 
It appeared before us in
all its magestic glory...

Solaris - Gazel Ministry sent
a massive force there to
obtain "god and his wisdom".
 
...But, by now, neither the
nation of Solaris, nor the
organization known as Gebler,
existed anymore.
 
The only thing that was left
there was an innumerable
accumulation of weapons.

Almost all of the Solarians
had been transfigured into
weapons...
 
The Gazel Ministry now
reigned over them as
their commanders.

There was no way we could
allow god or god's wisdom
to fall into the hands of
the ministry.
 
We decided to assemble
all the forces we could
and head toward Mahanon.
It was a perilous battle.
There was no guarantee
that we would make it
back alive.
 
We were to carry out the
plan at dawn. Hence, I
had to stiffen my resolve
concerning 'her'...

Overcome by indescribable
fear, I decided ascend to
Shevat which was stationed
in the skies above Nisan.
Awaiting me there was a
transmission from Krelian...
 
He told me that if I
wanted to save Fei and
the others, I would have
to come to Golgoda.
 
Krelian wanted me.

In order to save Fei and my
other friends, I departed
in the last Omnigear left
remaining in Shevat.
 
My previous fear of riding in
this machine was surmounted
by my desire to rescue the
people dear to me.

Renk
"Are you serious about
going it alone!?"

Elly
"Krelian told me to
come by myself."

Elly
"I can't afford to break
the agreement.
So please, stay behind and
protect everyone here."

Helmholz
"But, it's a trap!"

Elly
"I know."

Stratski
"Then why!?"

Elly
"If I do not go, Fei and
them will be executed for
sure...
Krelian isn't concerned
with anyone else but me."

Renk
"So what makes you think
he's going to hold his
part of the bargain?
Do you have any way of
knowing that you will
definitely save your
friends by doing this?"

Elly
"No..."

Vance
"Then it's suicide!"

Elly
"It might be."

Elly
"But, I've made it this
far because of Fei and
the others...
Because they accepted me
as their friend."

Renk
"If you go away...
what about us...?
What about all the people
who have assembled in Nisan
that you leave behind?
Everyone's depending on
you for their spiritual
support."

Elly
"The people in Nisan will
be fine.
They can stand on their own
feet without any support
from me... This is also
true of you all, right?"

Broyer
"But why do you do
so much for him...?"

Elly
"I don't know...
I guess it's a woman's
prerogative to be selfish
...perhaps."

Helmholz
"A woman's prerogative...?"

Elly
"I'm not a holy woman of
any sort.
I'm just a regular woman.
I get angry...
I cry...
I laugh...
Although at times I can
resent others, I also
know how to love others.
Loving whole masses of
people at times...and
loving just one person
the rest of the time...
I am in supreme bliss
when I am embraced by
the man that I love."

Elly
"Giving what I have to him,
and receiving what he gives
me, we become one flesh...
That is the moment when I
am most at peace."

Elly
"It is my prerogative as
a woman to simply want to
save the man that I love!"

Vance
"Boss..."

Elly
"I'm sorry...for saying
such selfish things."

Elly
"I'll go and do all that
I can do for my friends.
So I want you all to do
whatever it is you can do
for our friends here."

Renk
"..."

Elly
"Well, I had better
get going now..."

1842
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Solaris' 'Mobile Surface
Supremacy Weapon' invaded
the area with great force...
Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no
match against it.
 
It was only a matter of
time before the Solaris
Mobile Weapon arrived in
Nisan.
After we pushed back the
Solarian Gear units, we
headed for Nortune...
to the Kislev capital's
administrative district.
 
We went there to obtain
our one and only means
of standing up against
the Mobile Weapon.

 Super Dimensional Gear
      Yggdrasil IV
	  
Bart
"Aaaalriiight!
Transformation
complete!
C'mon monster,
let's go!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Solaris Mobile Weapon
was destroyed...which
brought a sigh of relief
to the continent of Ignas.
 
Peace was signed and after
some 500 years of division,
the land of Ignas once
again became united.

Excitement spread throughout
Aveh, Nisan, Kislev, Shevat...

The sky shimmered as if to
celebrate. By the hands of
Elly, Citan, Taura and
Emeralda, the nanomachines
had been dispersed into
the atmosphere.

That was when disaster struck.
...Our songs of victory were
replaced by the sounds of
total pandemonium...

In the beginning we had no
idea what had transpired.
We...witnessed unexplicable
phenomena.
People from all parts of
the globe began to mutate
into abnormal forms.

It seemed to be triggered
when the nanomachines
removed the -Limiter- seal
that was placed on humankind
by Krelian in the past...
 
...The 'human' form with its
innate abilities released.

That's when I remembered
what Hammer had said back
in Solaris.
 
His words were...
 "What becomes of the
 normal humans...?"

After that, we went from place
to place, destroying all the
Soylent System facilities
located on the surface of the
earth and freed the people
held at each of the locations.
 
All the people that had been
mutated were taken in by Nisan
where they received treatment.

Those who had mutated only
mildly were treated with
Taura's nanomachines,
which reconstructed and
revived them.
 
They were able to return
back to their normal
bodies.
 
Unfortunately, there were some
that had such accelerated
symptoms that their treatment
was not as promising...

Trying to bring them back
to a form that resembled
a human was the best that
could be done.
 
However, mysteriously,
they no longer fought each
other for survival as they
did when they were held by
the Soylent System.

Of course, their recovery
from the physical pain of
the mutation may have
played a factor, but it
wasn't only that...
 
The majority of the people
received by Nisan were those
that had been admonished by
Elly and had regained their
humanity.

Between her work in destroying
the Soylent System facilities,
Elly also went around and
nursed the people in Nisan.
 
She aided the bodies of the
mutated and lent an ear to
those who had no other place
to go for help...

She was the very image of the
woman who created Nisan...
 
  'Mother Sophia'...
 
It became rumored that Elly
was a reincarnation or a
second advent of Sophia.

Go to Nisan and you will
receive salvation...
 
The news seemed to spread
further about and people
came from all over to be
saved, both physically
and spiritually.
 
Free from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers began to unite
in one place.

Although the initial impact
of being released from the
-Limiter- seal caused some
momentary chaos, everything
slowly began to settle down.
We then began to search for
the 'Anima Relics'...
the catalyst to transform
Gears into Omnigears.
 
In the past, ten Relics had
been recovered...
It is said that about half
of those are in the hands
of the Ministry.

According to Zephyr, there
should be several more
Relics hidden in the land.
 
We knew then that Solaris
would most certainly be
searching for them.
 
There was no way we could
allow Solaris to have them.
We visited the place where,
using archaic records, Zephyr
and her people had been able
to get clues on the where-
abouts of the Relics.
 
Following the information
we obtained from there, we
headed towards the ruins of
what seemed to be an ancient
civilization.

Having fled from the Elements,
who tried to take the Relic to
be used as a power to fulfill
Ramsus' desires...
 
we once again intiated our
search for information...
 
on the whereabouts of the
last known Relic...

Having completed the alignment
of the first Anima Relic with
Billy, there was a remarkable
change in the appearance and
structure of Billy's Gear.
They were units that merged
with the inorganic...
 
Of course we had no idea what
purpose these ancient Anima
Relics were created for.
But the fact that they played
some kind of role as weapons
was blatantly obvious.

Eventually their true
power will be released...
And we cannot allow this
power to fall into the
hands of evil.
 
In order to obtain the
final Relic, we headed for
a ruin that is believed to
be almost 10,000 years old.
...The remains of the first
civilization on our planet.

And...
 
a reunion with an old
'friend' awaited us...

Hammer disappeared into
the chasm with a look of
satisfaction...
 
Was he happy because he had
been able to attain it...?
'His brief moment of power'...
Hammer's smile...
Was that the look of joy from
attaining power...?
Or was it the look of relief
from the pain that was brought
upon him by his mutation...?

Ultimately, we had no other
choice but to defeat our
'friend', Hammer, for the
sake of our own survival...
 
Was there any other way
around it...?
I've never felt that fighting
was so futile, until now...

Elly cried continuously...
She hated herself for not
having the power to be able
to do anything to help him.
 
When I saw her like that,
I couldn't help thinking...
I can no longer allow her
to fight like this...
We returned to Ignas...
feeling that this had
become much more than
we could bear...

I was powerless...
 
All I could do was stand
by and watch as they took
Elly away from me...
 
I...am powerless...

Wiseman
"What are you
doing there?"

Fei
"Oh, it's you...
I...I wasn't able to beat
Grahf...
I didn't stand a chance
against him...
It was obvious from the
start."

Fei
"It was impossible to try
to defeat a monster machine
like that to begin with...
And...Elly...
Why was she so damn
foolish...?"

Fei
"I implicitly told her
not to come...
I told her to run away...
She had to have known it
was a trap."

Wiseman
"...Hmm..."

Wiseman
"Yes, you won't be able to
defeat him like that...
As long as you continue
fighting with that kind
of an attitude, that is."

Fei
"...?"

Wiseman
"The reason you lost and
that young lady was taken
was because of your pride.
Weren't you depending far
too much on the power of
your machine?
...Not to mention that new
'Id Power' you're now able
to control!
What is Grahf's source of
power? His machine? His
technique? His experience?
I do not think so...
It is his feelings.
His heart, his feelings,
are dominated by his
resentment and his hatred
of this world.
That hatred is his source
of power. Your feelings
weren't focused enough to
fight off Grahf.
That is why you could not
win. Your feelings must be
in the right place.
That is strength."

Wiseman
"I'm not surprised
you lost...
...seeing as you do
not understand the
true meaning of
strength..."

Fei
"Wiseman..."

Wiseman
"That young lady...
The only thing in her heart
was her desire to save you
all. She set aside her fear
and piloted that machine."

Wiseman
"It was because she had
such strong feelings that
you are all still alive...
That is what I think.
Of course you have been
defeated. However, that
doesn't mean it's over."

Wiseman
"How do you plan
on responding to
her feelings?
It is now your
turn to save her
...is it not?"

Fei
"..."

Wiseman
"Well, what are
you going to do?
...Fei..."

Fei
"I, errh...
I'm going to..."

In order to save Elly,
We began to search
desperately for her
whereabouts...
 
And two weeks later,
we found her.
Using the data obtained
from Razael and his own
nanomachine technology,
Krelian had begun the
construction of god's ark,
'Merkava'.
Its completion was imminent.
 
To prevent its activation,
and to rescue Elly...
we headed for Merkava!

Fei
"You again...?
Are you girls thinking
of going in there too?"

Dominia
"Don't get any wrong
ideas there. We are here
to help our Commander.
Miang and Krelian have been
manipulating his emotions
for the sole purpose of
eliminating the Emperor.
We simply want to free the
commander from those bonds
so that he may be saved!
It's neither for the sake
of the world...
nor for the sake of your
girlfriend, Elhaym!"

Dominia
"We have no intentions of
fighting on the same side
as you!"

Fei
"...Fine.
You have your own
battles to fight,
and we have ours...
Let's leave it at that."

Fei
"But...if things get out
of hand, you head back.
We'll handle it."

Dominia
"Hmph...
We'll make you eat those
words... You wait and see!"

We entered inside of Merkava
and, while fighting back
units of weapons that self-
regenerated through the use
of nanomachines, we headed
for the central core...
 
And then...
 
once again,
Ramsus appeared before us.

God...the inter-planetary
invasion weapon -Deus-...
had awakened and its ark,
 
Merkava
 
was activated.

Deus began to absorb,
one after the other,
the mutated people,
destined to be its parts...
 
While the non-mutated,
would eventually,
only become a threat to it.
To exterminate us
and our civilization...
 
it set into action.

The planet's surface
was devastated...
 
...by Merkava
and the weapons born
from out of it, called...
 
'the -Seraph- angels'.

While pursuing
the newly awakened Deus,
we chanced upon Fei,
whose whereabouts
had hitherto been lost...
 
Along with his Gear,
Weltall...
 
Discovered together
at the place where 'Merkava'
was originally located...

We were overjoyed by
Fei's return...but
it was short lived...
 
For some unknown reason...
Fei was found in a state of
suspended animation.
 
He did not regain
consciousness.

The people of Shevat,
and we ourselves,
feared a relapse of
Fei's, no...
Id's power...
and had no choice
but to put Fei into...
 
'Carbonite Freeze'.

Citan
"...Your Majesty.
Why do the people of
Shevat fear Fei so much?
Even if Grahf and Id's
power are comparable..."

Zephyr
"...
It is not that
we fear him."

Zephyr
"We fear the error we
ourselves committed.
And now we are simply
trying to put a lid
on it..."

Citan
"The error that you
yourselves committed?"

Zephyr
"Shevat instigated a battle
500 years ago to gain our
independence from Solaris.
However, we became overcome
with the lust for power...
Fearing the war-torn
people's will would no
longer be with Shevat, but
with the Nisan Mother...
and that the people would
assemble under Sophia...
...the Council of Elders
of Shevat back then, made
a deal with Solaris."

Citan
"A deal?"

Zephyr
"Yes..."

Zephyr
"At the time, Solaris...
or the Gazel Ministry to
be exact...
...were at odds with a
woman who held the real
power behind the scenes."

Citan
"...Would that happen
to have been Miang?"

Zephyr
"Most probably it was."

Fearing the increasing power
of the masses assembling in
Nisan, the Gazel Ministry
schemed to hand over to us
their antagonist, Miang, and
promised a division of the
rulership over the earth's
surface.
 
But in exchange...
 
We had to give them the rebel
army that had assembled in
Nisan and also their patron,
Sophia...

Zephyr
"The leaders of Shevat
accepted...
...and it was decided that
Nisan would be the location
of the final decisive
battle with Solaris."

Zephyr
"Shevat did not participate
in that battle...
Thwarted by the awesome
numbers of the Solarian
army, and with their path
of retreat cut off...
...the Nisan rebel army
ran out of options and
was destroyed...
Caught up in the middle
of all this was Lacan,
Bart's ancestor Roni,
myself... and 'Krelian'."

Citan
"You were also there?"

Zephyr
"Yes...
Surrounded on all sides...
we were prepared to die.
And then, the rebel
forces' flagship appeared
with Sophia on board.
She sacrificed herself
so as to create a path
for our retreat...
Sophia's ship headed
straight for the enemy's
main ship on a suicide
attack."

Zephyr
"Thanks to Sophia's
sacrifice, we were
able to survive.
However, her death
forever changed the
fate of two men..."

Krelian, who followed closely
under her as the leader of the
Nisan sect's militia, completely
lost faith after calling out to
a god that would not respond.
 
    "I will create god
    with my own hands!"
 
...were the last words he
uttered before he disappeared.

And Lacan...
 
He resented himself for
not having the power
to do anything while she
died in front of him...
 
...So he began to search
for the 'Legendary Power'.

Citan
"Legendary Power?"

Zephyr
"God's resting place, 
'Mahanon'... The source of
divine wisdom, 'Razael'...
And the 'Anima Relics'
which were created by
that very wisdom...
Besides these...
there is one more
legend."

Citan
"And that is?"

Zephyr
"'Zohar'..."

Citan
"Zohar!?
That has the same name as
the 'Zohar Modifier'...
...the power reactor that
Miang spoke of, saying it
was the infinite energy
source of god -Deus-...
What she claimed is also
the source of our Ether
powers and the driving
force of all our Gears."

Zephyr
"It would have to be one
and the same thing...
It is the place that
contains the ultimate
source of this world's
power.
It is said that only he
who has the correct
destiny would be able to
discover its location..."

Zephyr
"Losing all faith in
humanity, Lacan sought
after its power...
Lacan became Grahf...
and the world collapsed...
This tragedy happened
because of the people's
lust for power...
I must take part of the
responsibility for not
having been able to stop
it...
And now, Fei...
the one who has the same
power as Grahf...
We just wanted to seal
up that dreadful power
that arose from our own
sinful deeds..."

Grahf, the man once known
as Lacan, sought after
the 'Power of Zohar'...
 
  The one who has the same
  power as Grahf...Fei...
 
I had this premonition
that Fei too would awaken
and seek out that power.
 
And that presentiment
became reality.

He broke through his
carbonite encasing...
 
'Id'...Fei took his
Gear Weltall and went
in search of Zohar.
 
We followed Fei's trail.
 
Eventually, we arrived at
the location where Zohar
had fallen to earth...
so very long ago...

Nothing could have prepared
us for what we were about
to see there...

We set out to silence god's
ark, 'Merkava', which was
the epitome of offensive
and defensive power...
and then storm inside it...
 
We initiated the operation
to destroy 'Zohar'.

At that time, the earth
quaked and shook. And,
from the location where
the Merkava crashed, a
giant object appeared.
 
It was Deus' final form.
 
The Merkava was merely
its vessel.
Deus evolved through
the use of Krelian's
nanomachines into a
planetary scale weapon
and began terraforming.

It was attempting to
convert this entire
planet into a weapon...
 
We retreated back to the
base at the snow plains
to form a new strategy...
 
We decided to go back into
Deus. Time was running out
for us.

1844
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Driving back the Solarian
interceptor forces, we
took to the floating
continent, Mahanon.
 
It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
with a diameter of at
least 40 kelts.
 
Judging from the condition
of the hull, we estimated
the ship was thousands of
years old.

"Alien beings that came
to our planet from a far
off galaxy, aeons ago..."
 
Could it possibly have been
that our ancestors were the
passengers of this ship and
had crash landed here on
this planet...
 
It was determined, by
examining the inside
of the wreckage, that
some kind of accident
occured on this ship
about 10,000 years ago
...which forced it to
crash onto our planet.
 
Seeking god and his divine
wisdom...'Razael's Tree'...
which, it is said, lie here in
Mahanon, we proceeded further.

In the depths we saw
an alien form. It was
partially rotted and
petrified, a giant
grotesque being...
 
'It' gave off an
inexplicable air of
intimidation.
 
Perhaps it was more
than a gut reaction.
Perhaps it was the
fear of the 'Absolute'
that came from the
very depths of our
inherited instincts...
And then...
'It' attacked us.

The partially rotted
thing eventually
disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even
further leaving
that area behind...
 
We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.
In its center were two
gently glowing objects.

It was the source
of divine wisdom...
It was 'Razael's Tree'.
 
And the cavern itself
was the giant computer
called Razael.
 
The wisdom of god,
hidden within Razael...
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.

A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them...

These weapons were called,
'Yabeh', the inter-planetary
strategic weapon system.
 
The construction of god's
ark... The army with which
to reign over the vast
universe... The creation of
the angel 'Malakh'...
 
What the Gazel Ministry was
looking for was right here.

According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.

We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'
 
...the central neural circuit
and power source controlling
the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...
 
When suddenly, 'HE' appeared.

Grahf, Krelian...It was
obvious they were after
the data that was recorded
in Razael.
 
If this data fell into
their hands...
 
They had to be stopped...

Krelian
"The data hidden within
Razael's Tree. Could
you move out of the way?
That data is beyond your
abilities..."

Fei
"We have to protect this
with our lives! 
We can't let them have
the Razael Data!"

Citan
"You handle them!
I will try and extract as
much data as I am able to!"

Citan
"If something goes wrong,
I will destroy this place!"

Fei
"Ghu, gahh..."

Grahf
"It's over for you."

Grahf
"Regretful? But that is
to be expected. You are
incomplete."

Fei
"I, incomplete!?"

Grahf
"Yes. That which you
presently lack. Namely,
your lack of hatred.
It supresses your true
powers!"

Fei
"H, hatred...?"

Grahf
"The desire to destroy
another, the want to
annihilate and massacre.
That is hate. The source
of power!
One attains this desire
through the first
instance of destroying
another. A sublimation.
That sublimation is what
rekindles the hidden
power!
Clutching on to your
reasoning, holding back
your hatred, your desires.
Unleashing your true power
is but only a dream within
a dream for you..."

Grahf
"You know it to be true.
Did not that machine
respond when you held the
anger within your heart?
The one who draws out
that machine's power.
The soul of desire.
That is Id."

Grahf
"As you wished, you have
the mark of an assassin
by birth!"

Fei
"That's no true! That's
impossible!"

Fei
"I'm, I'm not Id!
I..."

Grahf
"It is time..."

Grahf
"I shall consume your soul
and bring out that power
to its utmost limit!"

Krelian
"Enough!"

Grahf
"Hm?
Why do you stop me?"

Krelian
"He is bait.
If you kill the bait the
little bird we wish to
catch will only escape.
My precious little bird,
the one 'who I cannot
fulfill my merciful prayer
without'.
...You understand, do you
not? 'Lacan'..."

Grahf
"...Do what you will."

Krelian
"We will crucify these
ones.
The place will be 
southwest of here,
on top of 
'Golgoda Hill'."

Krelian
"Bind the broken Gears!"

Citan
"Elly!?"

Fei
"You idiot!
Why did you come here!?"

Fei
"Krelian's after you!
Forget about us!
Run and save yourself!!"

Elly
"I came as I was told.
I'm the only one you
need...
They have nothing to
do with this.
So let Fei and the
others go!"

Krelian
"How gallant you are,
Elhaym.
It's as if 'that scene
from the past has been
brought back to life
in the present'.
So, you came in an
Omnigear.
That too is...
'her Gear'.
Hmmm...
Allow me to confirm
something."

Krelian
"I'll consider what kind of
treatment your friends will
receive...on one condition.
...That you first defeat
these two men here with
that Gear you came in...
How about it, Elhaym?"

Fei
"Forget it, Elly!
He's up to something!
Don't accept it!"

Citan
"Fei is right!
Krelian is not a man
of his word...
And he always has
ulterior motives when
he sweet talks someone!
What is more, those men
are fighting machines
created by Krelian.
Their combat skills are
immeasurable! They are
not opponents you can
handle by yourself!
Do not take him up
on his offer!
Escape while you can!!"

Krelian
"My my...
Such harsh criticism.
I am not that brutal.
So, what will it be Elhaym?
Even if you were to try to
flee now, it is not likely
you would be able to...
You see...
I have this whole area
surrounded by my guards!"

Krelian
"Wouldn't it be logical to
take the choice where you
may still stand a chance...
...No matter how slight it
may be?"

Fei
"Don't do it, Elly!"

Elly
"Alright then...
I'll do what you say"

Krelian
"Good.
You are indeed my
precious little bird.
Now, get on with it!"

Elly
"If it gives Fei and
them even the slightest
chance of escape...
Then I will fight!
I don't care if it even
costs me my life!!"

Elly
"They're too fast!!"

Elly
"Outmatched...
Even in my Omnigear...
But...I can't just...
No...not like this..."

Elly
"I can't lose!!"

Elly
"M, must... somehow...
stop... movement..."

Elly
"Stopped!?
Now's my chance!
Haaaaaaaaaah!"

Elly
"Did I do it!?"

Elly
"H, how could that...!?
I thought it had some
sort of effect..."

Elly
"Gaah..."

Elly
"Guh...!
... Huff...
Huff..."

"Girl, that hurt!
I'll get you back!!"
"It was wrong of you
to underestimate
our power!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
file43
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elly
"Guh...!
... Huff... Huff..."

"Heh heh heh heh heeeh!
The final blow!!"

"Heh heh heh. Downed!"
"It's to be expected.
Multiple fractures,
and major blood loss...
I wouldn't be surprised
if the cockpit is a sea
of blood."
"At worst, death?
Geh hah hah hah!!"

"Heh??"

"!!!"

"H, how dare you!
You, you little...!!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Hmmm, I'm getting no
results. It can't be
helped, Mugwort.
It's about time to
finish the job."

"Gahahahah! 
Downed yet!?"
"It's to be expected.
Multiple fractures,
major blood loss...
I wouldn't be surprised
if the cockpit is a sea
of blood."
"At worst, death!
Geh hah hah hah!!"

"What the... !?
There's no way you could
stand after taking that
much damage..."

"M, Mugwort!!?"

"Why you! How dare you
do that to my partner!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fei
"No way...!
Elly...!"

Krelian
"Her true awakening...?
Or just merely...
'protecting her master'...?
Either way, it does not
alter the fact that she is
the -Mother- existence that
I have been searching for!"

Krelian
"Now men...
recover that machine.
Place priority on the
safety of the pilot.
Use whatever it takes
to preserve her life!"

Krelian
"Well then, I shall be
taking this girl with me!
As for the rest of you...
Why don't you just wallow
there pathetically while
you meditate on your own
lack of any real power."

Grahf
"Pitiful..."

Grahf
"You can't even protect
a single woman.
It is not even worth
the effort of putting a
spineless wretch like
you out of your misery!"

Elly was taken away...
And, as Krelian had told
her, we were left alive...
 
Was Krelian just keeping
his promise...
No, that can't be it...
 
There had to be another
'real' reason why he
allowed us to live...

And we had to find that out...

The people who mutated into
what were called Wels...or
the true form of humans...
gathered at these facilities.

Some of the humans turned
Wels were attacking healthy
humans and devouring their
flesh and blood.

That is because healthy
human flesh and blood
eased the pain of their
sudden molecular changes
and let them live longer.
 
Their lives were so short...

Soon after, severely mutated
beings started to seek the
flesh and blood of the less
mutated beings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1848
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Soylent System...
 
A group of facilities
formerly created by
Solaris.

These facilities existed all
over the earth.
It is said that, originally,
these were used for biological
experiments and brainwashing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1850
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There, humans fought
amongst themselves
greedily for limited
pardons to live.
It was an ugly battle
to keep on living.
Or so it may have seemed
to the casual passerby...
But to me they were
desperately trying to live.
It was each person's
'natural human form'.

There were the 'haves'
and the 'have-nots'...
And...among them...
were some of my former
friends from Solaris...

They wanted our flesh
and blood. They told us,
the 'haves' should share
with the 'have-nots'.
 
They asked if a 'have',
such as myself could
understand their pain...

I couldn't answer...
 
No matter what I said it
would have sounded like a
conceited 'have' speaking...
 
Even so, I wanted to
relieve their anguish...
And I decided to do so.

Just like the person in the
memory of my dreams...
in the distant past...

Then suddenly the System went
out of control!
The 'Sufal Mass', a monstrous
organism still in the process
of amalgamation, broke through
the barrier of the life-support
facilities and stood before us.

No longer of human form...
that which was once human
began eating the people
gathered there seeking
relief...
We had to fight it...
In order to save the people
and in order to save 'him'...
 
The eyes of that which was
once human looked at me,
pleading for...death...
to take away the agony.

Elly
"Citan...
please lend me
your sword."

Elly
"Please! Listen to me!
Stop fighting among your-
selves. We are all humans!"

Elly
"This facility was built
by the Solaris Ministry...
It was created to implement
their 'no waste' plan.
Such facilities were to
convert mutated humans
into weapons that serve as
tools for their ambitions.
Just one part of their
overall plan of racial
purification."

Sophia
"Of course, once you
enter their umbrella
of protection...
...you can avoid
absolute death.
But is that human life?
Even if you are the only
one left, if you're
devoid of a heart,
what does it all mean?"

Elly
"All of you, want to be
loved...needed by someone,
so we look to others...
By ourselves, we are
lonely, so we try to
draw close together to
live...
That's what it means to
be human...
That's how people live.
A single hand cannot
clap."

Sophia
"To relieve your pain,
I'll give however much
of my flesh you need.
Therefore...
don't throw away your
dignity as humans...
Don't let go of your
human heart..."

Fei
"Elly...!
Are you okay? 
What are you doing?"

Elly
"You think I am doing
something...foolish?"

Fei
"No..."

Elly
"I only did what I could.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
A well-to-do 'have'.
Maybe it's only pity for
the 'have nots'...
But if I can know the joy
of giving out a little of
the life within me...
Then maybe someday it may
just be possible that one
human can truly give love
to another...
People can do it...
I truly believe they can.
That's why..."

The Soylent System
divides and merges
those mutated bodies
on a molecular level...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1854
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A set of facilities that
recreate a more perfect
single lifeform to be
used as...a 'weapon'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1856
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Go to those facilities and
  you will be freed from the
  unbearable agony...
 
So people gathered, seeking a
fulfillment of this promise.
 
  There is salvation there...
 
The news spread...although
no one actually uttered it.

Their mutated blood
probably told such
people to 'gather'
there...

We went there to destroy
the Soylent System...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This was the truth behind the
Gazel Ministry's 'M Plan'.

Fei
"What meaning is there
in fighting again!?"

Elly
"Stop this useless
fighting!"

Elly
"Some things only the weak
can feel...
But weakness does not make
them servile.
It's because they are weak,
that they can develop
kindness...and never look
down on people.
That is where real human
interaction comes from.
Everyone has weaknesses.
Even you did at first.
Your weakness drew you to
each other...
And made you grow strong.
Never forget those feelings.
When you all lived together
side by side..."

Elly
"You've got us all wrong,
Dominia.
Our paths may be different,
but our goals are the same.
That's why I can't fight
you anymore. There's no
reason for me to...
That's all."

Dominia
"What took you!?"

Dominia
"Silence!
Now we have no choice
but to fight.
Now we will show you
the true power of the
Elements! Get ready...
because here we come!"

Elements in unison
"Elements' Formation!"

Dominia
"Wait!"

Dominia
"Are you trying to show
us mercy? Or are you just
trying to show off...?"

Dominia
"Hmph..."

Fei
"You girls again!?"

Fei
"You knew what Solaris
was doing to the surface
dwellers...
And you know what the
situation is like now
on the earth...
And yet you..."

Fei
"Power and ability have
nothing to do with it.
It was pure coincidence
that we didn't mutate."

Elly
"Dominia...
Do you truly believe that?"

Elly
"You were all once
surface dwellers.
Weren't you all forced
to live under the
oppression of Solaris?
I KNOW that you know
how it feels to be a
'have-not', so why do
you...?"

Elly
"That is just the
providence of those
who are the 'haves'!"

Billy
"Elements!"

Billy
"People are people.
Nothing more or less.
I admit that there are
the weak and powerless.
But that's no reason
for us to forsake them.
We are all the same
human beings!"

Gear that has been aligned
with an Anima Relic."

Dominia
"What the Gazel do or what-
ever happens to the Lambs,
are not my concerns.
Each of us have our own
obligations to fulfill.
We don't have time to deal
with affairs concerning you
weak and inferior people."

Dominia
"Yes.
Look at yourselves,
for instance...
You, the strong and the
superior, were the first
to preserve yourselves,
without any mutations.
Is that not right?"

Dominia
"So...
You wish to give a hand to
those who would be saved?"

Dominia
"Hmph.
So be it then, show me
this providence of yours
that wishes to save the
meager 'have-nots'!"

Dominia
"Here I come!"

Dominia
"Hah...
We may have fared poorly
when we fought in the
flesh, but we will finish
you off in our Gears!"

"Come!
Follow me!"

Kelvena
"You know that we should
have been the ones to have
it...
We need stronger powers in
order for Commander Ramsus
to realize his long-
cherished desires."

Kelvena
"How commendable.
But...is that really
what's best for mankind?"

Kelvena
"People must be able to
stand on their own in any
circumstances they are in.
Overprotection only stunts
the will to be independent.
This stunts the growth of
the people and the world.
We've experienced that
first hand.
Live by one's own strength,
stand on one's own feet!
It's sad but true that the
weak will be weeded out...
But we cannot look back.
That is the providence of
human existence."

Seraphita
"So, c'mon...
let us have it!"

Seraphita
"You're so ni~ce
and ki~nd!"

Tolone
"Yes, for the building of
our ideal country, we can't
allow you to take it."

Anyway, just leave that

Resistance is useless.

Driving back the Solarian
interceptor forces, we
took to the floating
continent, Mahanon.

It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
with a diameter of at
least 40 kelts.

Judging from the condition
of the hull, we estimated
the ship was thousands of
years old.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1912
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It was determined, by
examining the inside
of the wreckage, that
some kind of accident
occured on this ship
about 10,000 years ago
...which forced it to
crash onto our planet.

"Alien beings that came
to our planet from a far
off galaxy, aeons ago..."
 
Could it possibly have been
that our ancestors were the
passengers of this ship and
had crash landed here on
this planet...

Seeking god and his divine
wisdom...'Razael's Tree'...
which, it is said, lie here in
Mahanon, we proceeded further.

Do you wish to save?

In the depths we saw
an alien form. It was
partially rotted and
petrified...a giant,
grotesque being...
  'It' gave off an
  inexplicable air
  of intimidation.
 
Perhaps it was more
than a gut reaction.
Perhaps it was the
fear of the 'Absolute'
that came from the
very depths of our
inherited instincts...

Fei
"That...
was the ultimate power?"

The partially rotted thing
eventually self-disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even further...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1916

Bart
"Damn!
We were so close!"

Billy
"So near and yet...!"

Rico
"Dammit!
So close...!"

Emeralda
"Oh, so close...!"

Chu-Chu
"Chu bad!
We were so close...!"

Maria
"We were so close...!"

We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.

In its center were two
gently glowing objects.

It was the source
of divine wisdom...
It was 'Razael's Tree'.

And the cavern itself
was a giant computer
called Razael.

The wisdom of god,
hidden within Razael...
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.

A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them...

The creation of the
-Malakh- angel...
God's army to reign over
the vast universe with...
 
And the construction of a
divine ark...

These weapons were called,
'Yabeh', the inter-planetary
invasion weapon system.

What the Gazel Ministry was
pursuing was right here.

According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.

We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'       
...the central neural circuit
and power source controlling
the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...

When suddenly,
'HE' appeared.

Krelian
"Ah, the hidden data
from Razael's Tree...
Move away from there.
This matter is far
too weighty for the
likes of you."

Fei
"We must protect it with
our lives! We can't let
them have the Razael data!"

Citan
"You handle them!
I will try and extract as
much data as I am able to!
If anything goes wrong...
I will destroy this place!"

Fei
"Uhhhh..."

Grahf
"I guess that's all
you can take for now.
Are you frustrated?
But that is...
'only natural'.
After all, you are
imperfect."

Fei
"Imperfect!?"

Grahf
"Yes.
You are lacking now.
The absence of wrath
is an impediment to
you utilizing your
true strength!"

Fei
"W, wrath...?"

Grahf
"The drive to massacre and
annihilate, the compulsion
to destroy your opponent...
Such wrath is power for the
soul! By eliminating your
foe, you attain your first
sublimation of that drive.
It is this very sublimation
that draws out the hidden
powers within oneself!
But, clinging to reason...
...suppressing your wrath
and desire, makes releasing
your true power a dream
within a dream for you.
You already know this...
When wrath appeared in
your heart, the machine
responded, did it not?
What drew out such power
from your machine was
truly the drive of your
soul... It was your 'Id'.
The sign of the purpose
you've been seeking...
The mark of a natural
born assassin!"

Fei
"You're wrong!
That's absolutely
untrue!"

Fei
"I, I am not 'Id'!
I..."

Grahf
"The time has come...
I'll take your soul,
and draw its power
out to the limit!"

Krelian
"Enough!"

Grahf
"Huh?
What are you
stopping me for!?"

Krelian
"He is bait.
If you kill the bait,
the precious bird we
wish to capture will
fly away.
You know...a very
important bird...
'needed to fulfill my
earnest desire'...
You understand, don't
you, Lacan...?"

Grahf
"...
Suit yourself."

Krelian
"We shall crucify them.
In the land of Golgoda,
to the west of here.
Collect all the broken
Gears!"

Who...

This is...

Everyone...
My...memories.

Elly?

Mother?

Who are you?

I'm surprised.
That's pretty clever.

You are...
Id?

I misjudged you.
I didn't expect you,
the fake personality,
would create a fourth
persona.

Fourth persona?

He can't feel anything.
He's shut up inside your
ego.
The pressing facts and
truths you won't face.
You're afraid of them, so
you desired to completely
shut yourself off from
the outside world.

And so you formed
a fourth persona.
A fourth 'Fei'.
The name...doesn't matter.
He's the one on the stage.
He's the one who's in
control of our body.
But it is a useless
form of resistance.

Come with me!

Wait!
What are
you doing?

He has the key.
I merely want
to borrow it.
I've got to
go somewhere.

Are you...
coming too?

This is as far
as you can come.

From here on is my world.
You can't enter.

What do you mean?

You're a subordinate,
fake persona...
that's why.

A subordinate
fake persona?

Yes...
He has part of my
memories from back then...
He has sealed away
the very meaning of
my existence...
my drive...
my motivation...
my subconscious -Id-.
Because of that,
I became a basic,
blank persona.
And on top of that, I
constructed a new persona
based on my experiences
since then...
That is what you are now!

Him? 
You mean father?

You call him father?
He who never did
anything for you?

It was because of his
cowardly behavior...
If only he had been
able to protect me...

If he had done that...
mother wouldn't have died...

Didn't my mother die
right after I was born?
What really happened to
my mother? Tell me Id!

You don't need to know.
You'll only disappear soon.
Along with your basic
persona, the 'coward'.
I'll rule my being through
the power of the Existence.

??

Of course you don't know.
But it is etched in my
metempsychotic memory.
Your persona is fake, so
you'll never stand on the
'stage' of consciousness.
You'll never be able to
take charge of the memories
from our past lives.

I know the dreams and
hallucinations! I've
seen them many times!

Them...
I showed them to
you on purpose.
To break the seal,
I chose to weaken
the power of your
existence.
If your mental
energy is weakened,
I can become free
to do as I wish.

What?

There are still things
inside you which you
haven't been shown yet...

Huh?

Someone's coming!
It's probably your friends.
They must have followed me.

Where are you going?

I came to reestablish
contact with the
Existence.
To tie together all the
threads of your memories
since ancient times...
and then cut them off...
That is the fate of the
Contact... All is ready.
It's time for the true
awakening!
I will eliminate all
those who were full of
hypocrisy from the very
beginning.

Wait!
Wait for me, Id!

You just stay
here and observe!

Yes...
This is inside Id.
A world filled with
hatred and sadness.
That's all that's here...
Yes...
Now I understand, Id.
Why you hate the world.
Why there is nothing
inside you...
Nothing...
Nothing was given to you...
Deprived of...
all the happy memories...
And yet...
It feels pleasant...
It almost feels good...
Now I get it...!
There's no need to resist.
I was originally just an
existence that was created
as a cover to hide Id.
So it would be better to
return to that place...
Let's come together...
To wipe away
everything...
Including ourselves...

Remember!
Were you not going
to help Elly?

Think!
Aren't you going
to help Elly?

Remember...!?
It's for her...Elly!
Aren't you going to
help her!?

Think kid, think!
Aren't you going
to help Elly?

Remember!?
Elly still there...
Still waiting!"

You mustn't forget!
The one you love...
Elly!
You've gotchu help her!

Remember...
Elly needs
you now!

Remember!
Were you not going
to help Elly?

Elly?
That's right...!
Elly...!

I've got to save Elly!

Mother was Miang.

Our's was an ordinary family.

A strict but reliable father.

A kind and loving mother.

Up till then, it was
complete happiness.

But one day...

Mother suddenly changed.

She was like a
totally different
person.
From that day on...
'Fei' lost his home.

Father was away often.
He had some important work.

In front of father
she acted normally.

When Fei tried to tell father
about mother's strange conduct
and the experiments, father's
mind was taken up by his work
and he didn't really listen.

He thought it was just
childhood fantasies.

But he didn't have
to endure the pain
much longer...

'Fei's' subconscious
discovered a way to
escape from the trauma.

He formed a separate
persona to deal with
things he didn't like
or couldn't bear.

He removed himself from
out of harms way.
My role was to have all the
things he hated forced upon
me, the moment they arose.

From the time of my
division from him, I
was dominated by hatred.
That hatred naturally
turned into destructive
impulses.

I wanted to destroy
everything.

Mother, father, 
the entire world...

Finally father noticed
mother's odd behavior, but
it was already too late.
I had completely separated
from that coward...
my original self.

The puppets were broken
...and...
'Fei's' heart was too...

What would make mother
do such a thing...?

Mother repeated the
experiments to study
the power she knew
existed within me.
Yes, that woman...
mother, was Miang.

That's a lie!

No, it's true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1932
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mom, help me!

What are you doing!?

No!

Nooo!

It was a scene...
    from hell!

When father was away from
home, 'Fei' was taken to
a place with mysterious
machines.

Inside there were many 
strangely dressed people.

Many types of probes were
injected into 'Fei's' body,
as the start to some kind
of experiments.
The tests caused Fei much
pain.

Mother didn't come
to his assistance.
Young 'Fei' had no
way of resisting.
But he was able to endure.

Eventually,
the experiments 
became unbearable.

Many people gathered
around 'Fei'.
These people had a high
compatibility with the
Anima Relics.
This psychic contact
with Fei was to force
him to awaken.

But no one could make
contact with 'Fei'.
The power drawn out of
'Fei', regardless of his
will, destroyed them all.

This is unbelieveable!
Mother allowed this to
take place...?
Psychic contact?
What do you mean by
'awaken' me?

To awaken god, everything
had to be in perfect order,
with nothing lacking...
Things divided in the past
must become one complete
whole again...

Countless people died
before Fei's eyes.

Men, women,
the old, the young,
even demi-humans...
Suffering, grief,
fear, ecstasy...
A variety of emotions
and words lingered...
And tumbled about Fei 
like broken dolls...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stop it!

Hey, mom!
Why aren't you

Dad...
Dad's gonna die!

Grahf came seeking
the power that
exists within me.
To return to his
own body.
You understand now,
don't you...?
Grahf is...Lacan.

We, his descendants who
inherited his lingering
thoughts and memories
from him, know only too
well...
Divided 500 years ago...
He would became a part
of us both...
Lacan became Grahf.
He destroyed everything
on the face of the earth.
He then mastered how
to possess the bodies
of others by dwelling
in their minds.
He was probably enabled
to do this after his
contact with the
'Existence'.
The bodies died but
Lacan's spirit
continued living by
possessing others.
He had come that day
to return his soul, at
last, to the perfect
reincarnation of his
physical body...
The body of 'Fei'.

Father...
fought him.
But he couldn't
protect mother or I.
He pitifully fought
on while coughing
up his life blood.

Grahf made a mockery of
father and mother would
not even help him when
he needed her the most.
As for their son...
'He' couldn't take what
was happening any more...

He gave into his feelings
and released his power.
And as a result...

...Mother died.

Mom!

And 'he', off-loaded
the results of his
actions onto me.
To avoid taking the
responsibility for
killing mother, he
used me as a shield.

"I also killed mother."

Thanks.
Pass it back to me.
I'm playing with
mother.

This is not...
reality!!

It's all lies!

It's all fake!

It's all a trick!!

All of it!
All of it!
All of it...!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What's this place...?

...What's he done now!?
He only called you in
here for his own sake...

This is inside the shell
of your basic character,
the room of the 'coward'.
I'm sure you've been here
many times before.

I see... 
I remember now...
In my dreams...

Everything despised and
unwanted he pushed onto me,
while he shut himself up
in his own little shell...
the 'coward' Fei.

The basis for our
personalities.

Who are you?
...Ah, you're my...

Hey...let's watch this
together! This is my most
treasured possession...

Hah...! By repeatedly
replaying the times he
was full of happiness
he lives in his own
happy little world.

While I'm still alive only
because of what's in those
left over dregs.

Here! I'll show you...
'everything' about me.

He pushed all the bad
things onto me...
but kept all the memories
filled with happiness and
mother's love to himself.
And he shut himself away
with those memories
inside his own little
shell...forever.
This is the place.
What you see before you,
is what he made.
He just keeps hanging on
to those memories.

That's what this is...

Stop it!
Just stop it!
This...
These scenes...
Are these all
there is to us?

Enough already!
There is nothing here!
Just a world filled with
deception and pain...

It can't be helped.
This is our world...
This is 'everything'...

No!
Get out!
This is my room!
I thought you would 
always be with me!

Why won't you see
reality? 
Happiness... Sadness...
Aren't these all parts that
combined to make the whole?
Why won't you show him?
Why don't you also show
Id what you always watch!

No!
That's mine!
I don't want to show
it to the person who
killed mother!!

You should talk.
You're the one who
killed mother!

No I didn't, you did!
I did not kill her!
Mother didn't care
for you...
Father didn't notice
either...
That's why you
killed her!
I didn't kill her!
I didn't!
I didn't...!

Knock it off!!

...'We' killed mother.
It's no one's fault
but ours.
It's not because she
became Miang or because
father didn't notice.
Don't look outside for
the reason. Don't blame
anyone but yourself.
Yes, mother was Miang,
and I know that you
suffered. No one could
have endured it.
But you can't push it
onto Id alone.
We are all one person.
We must all become one.
Right? Fei...

Walk on your own two feet!
Face up to the reality that
you don't want to see!

Show them to Id.
Everything you took
for yourself...

Lies! That woman...
This scene...
All illusions he made up!
I, my consciousness, can
see through this trick.
I won't be swayed!
I...! 
I...!

Id...that's enough!
Doing that isn't going
to solve anything.
Mother saved us at
the last moment.
That is the truth.
Right?
The reality isn't
all grim, Id...

My power...
couldn't save anyone.
It only destroyed.
I thought that I could
only make a connection
with others through
destruction.
So I had to destroy
it all. People...
The world...
Even Elly...

No...
That's not the case.
We can save others
just as our mother,
despite being Miang,
saved us.
Our power...
can save people...
We can save Elly!

...That's a first. 
Mother being so warm...
To me...
she almost seems...
too warm...

Fei.
Take the memories
I have within me.
You must know what
it used to be like
up until now.
Know our identity...
about who we are.
Then figure out what
ought to be done.
Our integration is
not yet complete.

this is all my fault..."

"Fei...?
You've returned to
your own self...
You've become one..."

If all of you hadn't
called out to me..."

Khan
"Urgh!"

Fei
"Dad!"

Khan
"Don't worry...
This is good...
This is, after all...I..."

Fei
"Dad?"

Khan
"You and..."

Fei
"Huh!?
G, Grahf!?
What's going on...?"

Grahf
"Ha ha...
'I' reached the limit of
the body I possessed, on
that day 3 years ago...
'I' required a body that
would tide me over until
your true awakening.
That is why 'I' acquired
the body of your father.
Regardless of your
awakening, your merging,
and the inherited memories
you had acquired...
...there was no way for
you to know of this, since
you had lost your memory
at that point...
At the point in which 'I'
merged with your father."

Fei
"Impossible...!
What about Wiseman...?
What about father...?"

Grahf
"Of course they were just
parts of me... I couldn't
hold on to Khan totally.
His ego was far stronger
than I imagined. When my
control weakened he showed
himself to you as Wiseman."

Fei
"Arggh..."

Grahf
"You have awakened.
This body is now
useless to me.
Now I must return to
my original body...
the reincarnation of my
body that you inhabit."

Fei
"Stop it...!
Dad...!"

Grahf
"I hear you Fei...
You see, he and I are one.
I am Khan, Khan is me.
He has become one with me,
so you too should open
your heart and unite with
me.
Then we can go on to
eliminate everything!"

Fei
"No...I...can't
...allow...you...to
...control...me!"

Grahf
"Hmph.
Protecting your master?
Then so be it.
I'll merge with both you
and your machine then.
Now come, Fei!
Fight me!"

Fei
"It's no use!
I know you're Lacan, and
that you're a part of me.
But that doesn't change
you being my father.
I could never really
fight you!

Grahf
"You're so naive!
Why don't you understand
that your naivety is what
killed Sophia, what killed
your mother 'Karen'?

Fei
"I already know that!
That's why I swore never
to run away again...
...that I must rescue Elly.
So don't get in my way!
Wake up! Open your eyes,
father...-Lacan-!"

Grahf
"If that's the case
..then fight me!
Fight me!!!"

Fei
"I can't!"

Grahf
"I see...
Then there's
no choice."

Fei
"!?"

Grahf
"Since you are so unwilling
to fight, I believe I'll
have to use them as bait."

 ! 

Fei
"Stop it!
Don't we have the same
memories? Can't you also
remember that sadness
you felt way back then?
Why then...why must you
destroy everything?
If we stop Deus, won't
this all be over!?"

Grahf
"You still don't understand
...even after your contact
with the Existence?
I came to understand after
my contact with the
Existence that, even if
Deus was destroyed...
...as long as humans still
inhabit this land, Miang...
Elhaym, will be born time
and again.
Then all living things may
as well perish along with
Deus itself. That's the
only path to freedom.
The path to release us from
the eternal cycles of life,
the tragedies of history
and the spell of fate!
Once I awaken Deus as a
weapon, I'll obliterate
all living things...
Then I'll use your awakened
self and that machine to
return everything to
nothing...
That's what I concluded.
Miang and Elhaym...are not
just Deus' mouthpieces.
That 'woman' is its main
body!
Why can't you see that?"

Fei
"That's not true.
She gave her life for me
by shielding me from harm!
Her eyes weren't Miang's!
Mother came back at the
last moment!
Miang, mother...even Elly,
were all humans born on
this planet!
Deus doesn't matter!
You'll see...
I will bring Elly back!
Father...
No, Grahf -Lacan-! 
If you won't back down..."

Grahf
"Never!"

Fei
"Then I have
no choice...!"

The time has come
to truly become one!

Khan
"What happened
to Fei...
Id!?"

Id
"Too bad.
The new personality of Fei
that you gave birth to...
...and all that work that
your persona did to make
him one, perfect, unified
whole has been wasted.
He will be swallowed up
by me!"

Khan
"I won't permit it! 
I will destroy you first!"

Id
"As if you could...sissy!
Mother died because of
your cowardly behavior.
And as a result, he ran
away from that reality
by entering into his
memories!
And now I continue my
existence bearing all
that hatred.
You wouldn't be able to
imagine what it's like!"

Khan
"I wasn't simply working
to unify Fei's personality,
you know!?
All that you and I feel...
the sadness, the hatred...
Even though he also
experienced such things...
Fei needed to be encouraged
to build himself up in
order to be able to
comprehend all of this.
Fei should be able to
understand all of your
feelings now!
But now you want to erase
the one who understands you
...to kill Fei! What is it
that you want?"

Id
"Why ask me such a thing
now?
My purpose is the same as
his...total destruction!
That and that alone!"

Khan
"Is this world so bad a
place...that there is only
hatred inside of you?"

Id
"You're the ones who made
me this way... You and
that woman! Admit it!"

Khan
"Argh...!
Fei...!!
Can you hear me?
Please take this fist
full of memories I am
giving you...
Become one...
with yourself...
and with me!
Only you can stop Id!!
Fei, please!!"

Khan
"That's right...
Karen had become Miang."

Khan
"It's nothing special.
Miang does not have
only one host body.
Miang's roots are sealed
in the genes of all
women. Any one of them
could become Miang."

Id
"It just happened to be
mother's turn.
Only Elly was 'special'
originally!!"

Khan
"Nooooooooo!"

Khan
"Karen, -Miang-, noticed
that Fei's memory time axis
had increased 2 or 3 fold.
She then became convinced
that Fei was the
'Contact'!"


...Yes, I was the Contact.
That's why HE called out
to me...
And why the time had come...

Khan
"I was a fool.
It was all my fault.
I was so busy with my
duties in Shevat that
I didn't notice Karen
had changed.
I couldn't save you
when you needed my
help."

Id
"Save me? ...Hah!
Why bother saying
such nonsense now?
It's not going to
change anything!
The only thing you
can do now is die
by my hand!"

Khan
"Urrrggh!!
Even still...
I'll show...you...
that I can...save you...!"

Dad!!

Stop it! Id!
Father has done
nothing wrong!

I know. This one is
the real culprit.
Mother and father
had no choice.

Grahf
"Why don't you
finish me off?
If you don't get
rid of me, then
you cannot get
what you want."

Fei
"It's alright...dad.
I understand.
You are not Grahf.
You are my father.
You and Grahf are one.
Your will and purpose
never change.
I knew that once we fought.
But let's stop now.
Our objectives should be
the same. 
It is the same as our
becoming one.
We don't have to fight."

Fei
"Arrghh!
What...!?
My body...!?"

Grahf
"Zohar is after you!
The last piece to combine
with Deus' system.
It seeks to unify with
you...the first to have
been divided from it."

Fei
"What..!?"

Grahf
"This is what Lacan wanted
all along. After all, I'm
an imperfect existence.
It was inevitable that
it would come to this...
considering what had
happened in the past.
Lacan's imperfect
secondary contact with
the Wave Existence split
his personality into two.
Eventually his body died,
but the original Lacan
transmigrated...
Bringing the destiny of
becoming a Contact with
him, he was reborn as
your present body.
The remaining persona,
just his desires, lived on
seperately by possessing
the bodies of others.
That is Grahf...that is
me.
I may have inherited
Lacan's will, but I'm not
the same as the 'Contact
Lacan'.
It is impossible for me
to make real contact.
There would be no true
melding and release.
Even though our bodies
may be different, I am
still half of you.
That fact remains.
Although I'm imperfect, I
can merge temporarily with
Zohar, and thus may be
able to buy you some time.
This is the only way I
can be one with you."

Grahf
"This is all I can do.
Deus' system will start
to look for you again.
Before then, you have
to destroy the newly
perfected Deus and
this Zohar modifier.
You're the only one
that can destroy the
physical barrier that
encases god's body."

Fei
"Dad!"

Grahf
"As you said, that was
Karen.
Through many generations
Miang is beginning to break
free from her bounds.
Now that Elhaym has merged
with Deus, she has all of
her memories back.
All the memories from her
original birth as the
Contact's complement up to
her current transmigration.
That includes all of the
lives she has lived as
Miang, and her substitutes,
over the centuries.
And of course, that
includes your mother's
memories too."

Fei
"Mother's
memories...?"

Grahf
"Fei, cut away all the
binds on mankind...
You should be able to
do that now. Save her
and all the other women
bound with her!"

 ? 

Fei
"It's nothing...
I'm just talking
to myself.
I'm sorry, for all the
trouble I've caused
everyone.
Thank you all so much!
Anyway, let's get going!
There is little time
left now...for me...
and for our planet!"

...Fei
...Fei...

Who is it?
Who's calling me...?

I...am...Har...

What is this light...?

I...I reside in Zohar.
I am the beginning and
the end.
The first and the last.

...God?

God...
Some would refer to me as that.
From a certain point of view,
it is right to view me as such.
But at the same time, I am not.
I...am also a part of you.

A part of me?

I am defined by how people
observe me.
You are actually talking to
a virtual version of me that
you yourself create...
I am 'your perception' of me.

I don't understand what
you are talking about.
Who, or what, are you?

In one word...
...EXISTENCE.

Existence?

In actuality, I do not have
a physical form.
I am an 'Existence' of a
higher dimension.
A place you cannot perceive...
But in terms you understand, it
is a world where everything
acts as kinds of waves...
It is the source of this
four-dimensional universe...
The place where time and
space is controlled...
The fluctuating void...
The 'Wave Existence'.

What does such an 'Existence'...
have to do with me...?

Long ago, a 'modifier', or a
pseudo-perpetual, infinite-
energy engine was created.
That engine was named 'Zohar'.
That reactor was created by an
ancient people from another
planet to attain what is
considered to be the ultimate
energy possible within this
four-dimensional universe.
Eventually, those people used
that same engine to create
the ultimate inter-planetary
invasion weapon, 'Deus'...
Zohar was used as its primary
source of power.
But the unexpected happened...
During the connection tests of
Zohar with the newly completed
Deus, the engine started to
examine infinite potential
phenomena...
Requiring energy, the engine
connected this dimension to
the higher dimensional space.
As a result, that reactor
'merged' or 'synchronized'
with the wave existence in
that higher dimension...ME.
I 'descended' from the point
of contact created by the
machine through the 'Path
of Sephirot', or the domain
you are in right now, and
incarnated in the four-
dimensional world.
After I 'Advented' to the four-
dimensional world, in order to
stabalize myself here, I had
to exchange, or materialize,
my form and enter into the
'modifier' engine...
In other words, I became bound
in 'Zohar'... the 'cage of
fleshly existence'.
Since the time I was bound in
Zohar, I have always wanted to
return to my own dimension...
And I came to a conclusion.
I had to reverse the process
I went through to arrive here.
I must be released by the one
who instilled within me a
special feature of this
dimension - the 'will'...
That one is you.

Decided it was me?
A special feature??

Yes.
I was given a special attribute
of a human by you, the Contact,
when you observed me...
I was given...a mother's will.

A mother's will?

I'm sure you remember.
After my descent, you had
contact with the modifier
engine, 'Zohar'.

!!

As a contact, being but only a
child, you defined my existence
with your desire to return to
your mother. Thus I came to
prepare the mother's will...
That will is Elhaym.

Elly's disposition was
influenced by me?

Yes.
My will was incarnated through
a bio-computer which was vital
for Deus.
After combining with me, the
bio-computer evolved its
functions, and that bio-plant
generated a central element.
That is her.
I was split by your contact.
My physical form or flesh
stayed in Zohar, while my
will went into Elhaym and
my power went into you.
That's why I waited to
unite with you.
And now, it is fulfilled.
My only remaining desire
is to break this 'cage
of fleshly existence'...
In order to do that, I must
become perfect by combining
with Elhaym, as well as my
other split physical form,
'Deus'.
The only way to return to
my original dimension is to
destroy this physical body.
In the four-dimensional world,
Zohar is perfect, so in order
to destroy Zohar I need the
strength that was attributed
to you...
Zohar can only be destroyed
by the hands of the 'Contact'.

What about Elly?
If Zohar is destroyed,
what will become of Elly!?

Zohar and Deus are one.
She is bound to the system
by another's will to become
one with me.
In order to release her, it
is necessary to destroy that
very system that serves as
the Deus weapon...
However, having been created
as a weapon, the Deus system
seeks to unify itself with
all of you for a different
purpose than that of mine.
Originally, her release
should have been performed
by me, the one who desires
to return back to the higher
dimension...
But, I am also bound to the
system just as she is, so I
am unable to participate.
You are the only one who
can release her from the
spell.
Just as Deus and I are
inseparable, you and her
are also inseparable.

...Alright.
I'll destroy Deus and
the Zohar modifier.
And I'll save Elly.

You have experienced much loss
and deprivation in your life.
It is very tragic.
Our contact, and the resulting
transference of power and will
between you and I, most likely
played a factor in splitting
your personality.

I disagree.
I can't blame anything
or anyone besides myself.
Regardless of what may have
happened in the past, with
the passing of time the
cause becomes more remote.
It is a problem that comes
from within myself, that I
myself must deal with...

I see...
You have managed to accept
those tragedies, to tolerate
all things, to comprehend
and find where you stand in
this world.
If you have succeeded to
do all these things, I am
sure you will succeed in
what awaits you now.

To liberate all of us...
Use...the...Xe...no...gears
...des...troy...Zohar...

Wait!
There's more I need
to ask you...

The system...is awakening...
Ask...her...later...

Even with an ancient fate,
there's a limit to what

that this is...!?"

"Well, I don't understand

That just ain't human..."

dummy messege

Fei
"This is where it all
started.
This is our genesis!
We...no,
humans were born here."

Fei
"...Long ago, Deus crash-
landed on this planet in an
interplanetary colony ship.
In order to revive itself
someday, Deus detached
the Zohar Modifier's
core...
After this core unit came
down here, a single woman
awoke and arose from out
of it."

Fei
"She's the mother of all
humanity..."

Fei
"After she awoke, she
used all her power to
bear several beings.
These would become the
ancestors of the whole
of humanity."

Fei
"These were the
Emperor and the
Gazel Ministry."

Fei
"Finally, she gave birth
to replicas of herself to
be humanity's caretakers."

Fei
"Two selves... 
The -human- Mother
and the weapon...
The Subject and
the Complement."

Fei
"That is Elly
and...Miang."

Fei
"I, the sole survivor
from the colony ship,
met Elly and...
Everything started
from there..."

Fei
"The land of genesis,
-Kadomony-...
This is that place."

Fei
"Usually, human memories
cannot be passed down
through the generations.
Humans do not normally have
the ability to compress and
store memories in their
introns."

Fei
"But Elly and I...
and Miang...
are different."

Fei
"Due to our connection with
the 'Wave Existence'...
That is, due to Zohar's
ability to change possible
phenomena, we can clearly
store data in our introns.
In other words, we can
leave behind memories
to be inherited by our
descendants."

Fei
"Just as the Wave Existence 
is bound inside of Zohar...
the information is affixed
to me, so to speak, by some
of the power of the Wave 
Existence."

Fei
"This is the form from
when Elly and Miang
were still one being...
This is the first
woman of our world..."

...La...can...

"Lacan, what is wrong?"

"Lacan?"

In that dream,
I was called 'Lacan'...
 
I was an artist...
I had become recognized as a
talented artist and now was
painting the portrait of the
Nisan Mother, 'Sophia'...

Lacan
"Huh...no,
it is nothing."

"...Let us finish for today.
You look rather tired.
...Are you alright?"

Lacan
"I am fine, thank you...
But, now that you mention
it..."

Lacan
"Shall we stop for the day?
You must be the one who is
tired, 'Mother Sophia'?"

Sophia
"Enough of that, now."

Sophia
"When it is just the two of
us, would you stop calling
me that.
Just call me 'Elly'... As
you used to do in the old
days... And you don't have
to be so stiff and formal."

Lacan
"Oh, errh, alright.
Very wel...no, I mean...
Yes, let's do that 'Elly'!"

Lacan
"I think I might go back
home...
only for a week or so."

Elly
"Oh, really?
What is the matter?"

Lacan
"I ran out of paint.
So...I, errh, need to
go make some more."

Elly
"You're going all that
way...just to do that?"

Lacan
"If I don't go there,
I won't be able to get
the right pigments."

Elly
"Oh...
Then how about I have
one of my followers,
the -Kahal-, take you
in one of our Gears?"

Elly
"You'll arrive quicker
and you'll be much
more safe."

I lied...
I wasn't out of paint.
I just feared I would
finish the portrait.
I wanted to keep on
painting...forever.
So I wanted to buy
time...
She'd probably despise
me for that...
No,
she'd probably just
give me her usual smile.
She was that kind of
woman...

...La...can...

"Lacan, what is wrong?"

"Lacan?"

In that dream,
I was called 'Sophia'...
 
Mother Sophia...
A symbolic name...
Crowned upon the person who
would be the people's hope...
A name I was destined to have
Whether I wanted it or not...

Lacan
"Huh...no,
it is nothing."

"...Let us finish for today.
You look rather tired.
...Are you alright?"

Lacan
"I am fine, thank you...
But, now that you mention
it..."

Lacan
"Shall we stop for the day?
You must be the one who is
tired, 'Mother Sophia'?"

Sophia
"Enough of that, now."

Sophia
"When it is just the two of
us, would you stop calling
me that.
Just call me 'Elly'... As
you used to do in the old
days... And you don't have
to be so stiff and formal."

Lacan
"Oh, errh, alright.
Very wel...no, I mean...
Yes, let's do that 'Elly'!"

Lacan
"I think I might go back
home...
only for a week or so."

Elly
"Oh, really?
What is the matter?"

Lacan
"I ran out of paint.
So...I, errh, need to
go make some more."

Elly
"You're going all that

"If I don't go there,
I won't be able to get

Elly
"Oh...
Then how about I have
one of my followers,
the -Kahal-, take you
in one of our Gears?"

Elly
"You'll arrive quicker
and you'll be much
more safe."

I wonder when it started...
 
That he started refusing me...
The walls between us...
Our 'positions'...
Our 'circumstances'...
He refused to recognize these...
 
No...maybe it was me...

Therefore...
I didn't want them...
 
I wanted the two of us
to be ourselves...
 
That is what I wished for...
So,
I had him paint me...
 
The way I really am...

Elly
"What's wrong?
You don't look so good."

Elly
"Lately, you've seemed
melancholy almost everyday.
Has something happened?"

Lacan
"I don't know.
I just can't paint
right now.
Sorry, but do you
mind if we stop
here for today..."

Elly
"I see...
It is not good to push
yourself too hard...
Why don't you rest up
for a little while?
I'll have Krelian take
you..."

Krelian
"What are you
doing Lacan?"

Lacan
"Oh it's you, Krelian...
I was thinking...I'd stop
painting the portrait..."

Krelian
"Why stop now...?"

Lacan
"It's the circumstances.
I shouldn't be painting
her at a time like this."

Lacan
"Eventually she too must
stand at the front lines.
So..."

Krelian
"Is that really
the problem?"

Lacan
"..."

Krelian
"Lacan...?"

Lacan
"...
Her smile...
it's killing me.
The more she smiles at me,
the more I...I feel my
very being become
insignificant.
Inside my heart there is
this empty existence.
Other than painting,
I have no worth...
Yet, she continues to
accept my presence.
I feel like I'm getting
smaller and smaller."

Lacan
"I didn't have this
feeling in the beginning.
I just wanted to paint her
one more minute...
one more second longer...
I wanted to keep on
painting forever.
But, suddenly I couldn't.
As the picture neared
completion, the empty part
of me started to manifest
itself in my brush strokes.
I was meant to be painting
her as she really is...
but...this picture is...
my own self...
My empty self has begun to
appear within there.
That's why...
I've got to stop now."

Krelian
"Your own self...?"

Krelian
"You're just running away!
You can't bear it when
she smiles at you.
By painting her portrait,
you noticed the gap between
your own inner emptiness
and her inner abundance.
And you could not fill that
gap...
That's why you are quitting
your painting.
You are refusing her!
Even so, you still can't
bring yourself to leave
her, can you?
In spite of that...
why is it that she
continues to smile at you?
You who can't accept her
feelings...
You who won't accept her
feelings..."

Krelian
"Tell me why!?
If it was me...
who was receiving...
such feelings..."

Roni
"...Is this really
her true expression?"

Lacan
"Yeah...
To people who don't know
her that well...I guess..."

Roni
"Her smile...
I don't know...
The smile in this picture
is somehow different from
the one she usually shows
us.
I realize Lacan's feelings
are in there, but...
I don't think she has ever
opened herself up and shown
her inner self to others
like this before."

Roni
"You've been painting such
a beautiful expression of
Sophia...
I just can't see the reason
why you want to stop."

Lacan
"Beautiful...?
Forget it.
This picture...!?
It's anything but
beautiful..."

Roni
"Lacan, you say you're
empty. Then why do you
come along with us?
What we've been doing
up till now, are not
just acts of mercy...
It's a fight for freedom.
Time and again you've
been through life
threatening situations
with us..."

Roni
"A man who has nothing in
his heart couldn't do that
kind of thing...right?"

Lacan
"Roni, you're giving me
too much credit.
As long as you do some-
thing to keep yourself
occupied...you can ignore
the hollowness inside."

Lacan
"From the beginning, my
very existence itself
was an emptiness.
It wouldn't matter if I
were to die right now...
You live, you die...
That's all..."

Roni
"Pessimistic as usual,
Lacan...
And now you're lying."

Lacan
"..."

Roni
"It is just that you're not
good at expressing your own
feelings.
You're not empty.
She knows that.
That's why she shows only
you her true smile."

Lacan
"I don't deserve to
see her true smile.
She is the hope of the
people. Their support.
There is so much more
for her to do."

Lacan
"Why would she open her
heart to a mere artist
like me..."

Rene
"Bro! Bro~!"

Rene
"Hey, bro...
What are you
doing here?"

Roni
"What's up?"

Zephyr
"The Council of Elders of
Shevat issued a decision.
Tomorrow we will leave
for Soylent."

Roni
"Soylent?
That's in Solaris..."

Rene
"Yes.
And...Sophia will
be coming with us."

Krelian
"That's ridiculous!"

Krelian
"The refugees are still
increasing! We can't afford
to have Sophia leave Nisan!
And going to Soylent!
That's plain foolish!
It's too dangerous!
What are the elders
thinking?"

Zephyr
"No.
It wasn't the
council's wish."

Zephyr
"It was Sophia's will. It
appears that she expressed
this desire herself."

Krelian
"That can't be...
What is she thinking?"

Rene
"Originally, we 
talked about it
being just us..."

Krelian
"Just us...?"

Lacan
"..."

Sophia
"Faith in god...
Do not look for it on the
outside...
For it is something one must
build from within oneself..."

Krelian
"It's been a long 
time Lacan."

Lacan
"Krelian. 
You're back?"

Krelian
"I just got back 
last night.
You came back home 
to get paints, right?
Sophia told me.
Allow me to accompany
you."

Lacan
"Is that okay?"

Krelian
"Yeah.
I'll leave someone else
in command of my unit.
Because of Solaris,
things are a lot more
dangerous these days.
Anyway, wouldn't you feel
more secure if you were
with me?"

Lacan
"...Thanks."

1950
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lacan
"...What did you say?
What's the name of the 
teacher you're studying 
under?"

Krelian
"Melchior"

Lacan
"But still,
why are you studying?"

Krelian
"Sophia told me the best 
way to calm the heart is
to read a book...
It's a good opportunity.
And it has sparked my
interest in studying."

Krelian
"...Now,
I'm reading 3 books 
a day."

Lacan
"If it can change,
it will."

Lacan
"...The art of war,
that's all you think 
about......"

Krelian
"Hey, that's mean.
You know, I'm the best of
all of his students."

Lacan
"I see......
That's great,
it sounds like you found 
something to put your 
heart into......"

Krelian
"What do you mean?"

Krelian
"You have something.
Your pictures are 
splendid.
You should be 
thankful......"

Krelian
"Sophia first showed me
that books are the best
way to calm the heart...
...and now I'm hooked on
reading."

Krelian
"I'm not trying to brag...
but I've learned a lot of
things I never knew before.
Lately, I've been reading
this."

Lacan
"What is it?"

Krelian
"Something I borrowed 
from Melchior.
It's about a form of
molecular engineering...
nanotechnology.
I believe it's a book found
in the ancient ruins of the
Zeboim civilization.
It's a copy of someone's
research report, but it's
incomplete.
I think there were even
more wonderful things
written in it, but we'll
never know now..."

Margie
"Elly.
Are you okay
about this?
Don't you want
to be with him?"

Elly
"Yes...
But, it's because
I believe in him.
Just being close to a
person is not in itself
an indication of love,
is it?"

Margie
"But...
men are selfish...
When something big happens,
they say...
 'It's too dangerous...
  You can't come!'
They treat women like we
are weaklings."

Margie
"Although, it is true
I can't help Bart and
friends much anymore..."

Elly
"That's not true.
Everyone, wants someone 
special waiting for them.
Someone who will protect
a place they can return
to.
If you don't have that
peace of mind, then you
would not be able to get
anything done..."

Elly
"Men try to tough it out
as much as they can, and
then some...
They're cute the way they
do that, aren't they?"

Margie
"Yeah,
you're right..."

Elly
"Anyway, we have things
we have to do too, now.
And, while we do them,
let's pray that everyone
comes back safely."

Margie
"To god?"

Elly
"No...
To your own innermost
feelings that everyone
believes in..."

Elly
"What's wrong?"

Margie
"I knew it...
Yes, that must be it!"

Elly
"What?"

Margie
"Elly, it's like everyone
says! You must be a
reincarnation of Sophia!
You have no way of knowing
the Nisan Sect's teachings,
but what you say...
...well, it's exactly the
same as what Sophia always
said."

Elly
"Yes...
That might be it."

Elly
"The first time I
visited here I had the
most amazing feeling."

Elly
"Familiar...
Sad...
Like I had visited here
many times in my dreams..."

Elly
"I know where each room
is and what's in them.
I just know I must have
been here in the distant
past..."

Elly
"Before, if you had spoken
of this I'd have brushed
it off with a laugh.
But now..."

Now, I can more or
less believe it.

Elly
"The things I couldn't
do then...
I'm probably trying to
do now..."

Margie
"Things you couldn't
do...?"

Elly
"...Yes.
Things I couldn't do..."

Krelian
"Hmm...
'This time' your
body is young."

"...The previous
one got too old."

Krelian
"...And the name?"

"Karen...
but individual names
have no meaning to me."

Krelian
"So...
what brings
you here?"

Karen
"Is that thing inside
the Nanoreactor there
...the one?"

Krelian
"Huh? Oh...
Recogniton code
0808191 - 'Ramses'.
The Emperor's been told
it's a prototype for an
artificial 'Contact'."

Karen
"What's its status?"

Krelian
"It has entered the so-
called first growth stage.
From now until the binding,
its growth will be several
times faster than that of
an ordinary human.
But its psychological
development will be a
little difficult to
control..."

Krelian
"It is a replica...
so that is to be expected."

Karen
"It is moving...
Can it hear us?"

Krelian
"Yes...
It already has a
will of its own."

Karen
"Then...
I have a better way...
Let us dispose of it."

Karen
"We do not need this...
We have my child. My child
will be 4 this year."

Krelian
"Your having
a child is...
significant?"

Karen
"Yes...
I checked it out...
There is no mistake,
it's a 'Contact'."

Krelian
"What's its name?"

Karen
"My child's name
is...
'Fei'.
So...
you understand
what this means?"

Krelian
"A corresponding
'Antitype' is..."

Karen
"Yes...
probably already
born somewhere."

Karen
"...The final one!"

Krelian
"Then...
this thing is...
worthless."

Karen
"Yes, totally useless."

Karen
"Ha-ha...
Chase after it, 'boy'.
A love that's unattainable
for you, no matter how hard
you try to pursue it."

Until then...

Miang
"The chains that restrained
humankind have been removed
because of you."

Krelian
"But that doesn't mean
there is anything wrong
with our plan...
Everything is still
under control."

Krelian
"In the event of the
explosion in the capital
of Solaris earlier...
...I had set up a nano-
machine virus to diffuse
into the atmosphere.
I knew they were eventually
going to break the seal...
But the timing was a little
close for comfort...
The current mutations of
the humans are an initial
response to the virus...
Once the virus we spread
over the world germinates
inside of the humans they
are no longer the same.
They change into a
controllable form.
We need humans that do
not depend on the key's
invocation in order to
awaken.
In other words, a being
to take the place of the
original body of god..."

Miang
"It's like a trojan horse
released at the time of the
assimilation with god...
A literal virus...
But...isn't it different
from what they intended...?"

Krelian
"Of course. We can't let
them have it their way.
The 'Ark of god' is mine."

Miang
"...Either way is fine by
me.
I will just side with
whichever is the more
certain one anyway..."

Roni
"C'mon guys, eat up.
You haven't been able
to get this kinda food
around here lately,
have ya?" 

Roni
"Well, this is also due
to my business savvy."

Rene
"...What's wrong, Lacan?
You look kinda down.
What's bothering you?
Are you worried about
something?"

Lacan
"It's nothing...
I'm just thinking about
painting Sophia.
I don't know why I agreed 
to do her portrait..."

Rene
"Sophia... You mean your
childhood friend who's now
the Holy Mother of Nisan?"

Lacan
"She's not really a
childhood friend...
...I just made her
acquaintance at the
monastery near my home
when I was a child...
She went to the clinic
there for convalescence."

Lacan
"She was frail."

Rene
"So...
what are you worried
about painting her for?"

Lacan
"She does not wish 
herself to become a 
symbol of her sect.
...Actually, it seems
she wasn't interested
in having her portrait
painted at first.
But, when she heard I
would be the painter,
she turned around and
agreed.
That's what I don't
understand..."

Roni
"I see..."

Roni
"Then she must
like you..."

Lacan
"What are you
talking about?"

Roni
"That's how women are...
Right, Krelian...?"

Roni
"Hey, Krel!"

Krelian
"Huh?"

Rene
"...What's up?
You're not having any?
It's ready to eat."

Krelian
"Ah, yeah..."

Roni
"The Holy Mother
of Nisan, huh?
What, are you out
to offend divine
providence or
something, Lacan?"

Lacan
"Cut it out...!
It's not...
like that..."

Lacan
"Wh, what?"

You've gotta lighten
up a little...

Krelian
"Even so, there was a
time  when I did some
pretty vicious things.
I lashed out at random...
Everyone around me
feared me...
Even my friends.
I lived a life surrounded
by people who looked at me
with fear in their eyes."

Krelian
"But she was the only one
who wasn't afraid of me.
She would just smile.
Peace of mind...
She was the one who taught
me what that was and how I
could receive it...
She taught me how to live
as a human..."

Lacan
"A......portrait?"

Krelian
"Do you think I'll
let it end here!?
We are not their
possessions!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1962
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Krelian
"You're neglecting
yourself too much!
Why aren't you kinder
to yourself, Mistress?"

Krelian
"Sophia!"

Krelian
"Sophia..."

Krelian
"Lacan!
What are you doing?

You keep back!
I knew we couldn't leave
Sophia in your care!
I'll protect her...
even if it costs me
my life!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1964
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Roni
"Why don't you go get
some rest, Krel...?
You haven't slept since
the day before yesterday
have you? You shouldn't
do that to yourself!"

Krelian
"I'm fine, it's not
a problem..."

Roni
"Look, I'll watch over her,
so you go sleep.
What will we do if you also
fall ill? Do not forget you
are the head of the sect's
military forces."

Krelian
"Okay...
I suppose you are right."

Lacan
"Elly...
I am so sorry."

Lacan
"I...
It was my misjudgement
that did this to you."

Lacan
"I was terrified...
It was like you could see
right through me...
Your eyes... 
That look...
That was me that was
being reflected back
in your eyes...
I was looking at myself...
And thus painting myself...
I couldn't stand it!
So that's why...
Oh Elly...
What in the heavens did
you find inside of me?"

Lacan
"When you wake up, I think
I will ask you that...
On second thought, no...
No, I don't want to burden
you with my concerns...
Besides I wouldn't be able
to ask you...
One look into your eyes
and I can't say a thing...
I wouldn't even be able to
tell you how I feel..."

Sophia
"You are the sweetest
person..."

Lacan
"Elly...!"

Elly
"You are someone who cannot
bear to see others hurt by
your own actions.
So you hold everything in
and bear all the burden.
If you get hurt in the end,
you think that is fine..."

Elly
"That's...
what I like
about you."

Lacan
"Stop! Don't say that.
If you become just another
human, everyone will..."

Elly
"Humans...aren't all that
frail you know.
They don't need a symbol
who is just appearances
only.
I believe that if you have
light in your heart, you
can overcome any hardship.
What I have been doing is
simply showing people that
such light exists in the
hearts of everyone."

Elly
"I'm just a woman.
And to fulfill my womanhood
I am prepared to throw away
anything...
even this position.
I'm just playing the role
of Sophia.
But I am still me.
I haven't changed...
a cowardly, selfish,
crybaby...
I am still the same."

Elly
"Could you live a lie like
that and still be happy...?
I...don't want to do that."

Elly
"Oh, Lacan...
I want to live more
honestly with myself...
To be able to tell the
man that I love that I do
love him. And I don't care
if I get hurt or rejected.
You only have one life.
I don't want to turn around
later and regret not having
done such things..."

Lacan
"I...
   I..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lacan
"...Elly!?"

Miang
"If only you had power...
you could have saved her."

Miang
"You want it, don't you?
Unrivaled power...!"

Miang
"Don't you want to
become...
the absolute being...!?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1968
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lacan
"There...
That's what I have
sought after..."

But wait!
That's not what I want!
No!
This is my very desire!

...Live!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1970
----------------------------------------------------------------------

...Live!

Krelian
"We were sacrificed as
pawns...
In order to protect their
own authority...
Sophia was...
Is this the ideal world
we've been searching for?
What have we been doing?
Heading toward Sophia's
ideals...?
Is this our salvation?"

Krelian
"This isn't fair...
Sophia was sacrificed
for those bastards..."

Krelian
"Sophia said, if you just
have faith the path to what
you hope for will open.
But look at reality.
God didn't answer our
prayers...
Is that because we didn't
have faith?
Even if we didn't have
faith, Sophia did.
Why did she have to
be sacrificed?
Is god dead...?
Is he just not there...?
Maybe god never even
existed to begin with!"

Krelian
"Ha, ha, ha, ha...
I see...
That's it...
If god doesn't exist
in our world, then...
I will create god
with my own hands!"

Lacan
"Krelian..."

Krelian
"Sophia...
Please guide me...
I will destroy all
such false pretenses
of love, for you..."

Roni
"We need to gather all
our surviving comrades.
We'll never beat them if we
fight them individually...
So let us create a country
that can some day stand up
against them..."

Roni
"What are you going to do,
Lacan...?"

Lacan
"I..."

Lacan
"...What...is...this...place...?
...My execution site...?"

Lacan
"...Why do you turn on me?
I thought we were friends!"

Lacan
"Who...
is it...?"

Lacan
"Did I...
cause this...?
What has happened to me...?"

What...have...
I...become...?

Lacan
"...I will live...!"

Lacan
"Even if I go to hell,
I will live till the
end of this world.
And if the world does
not come to an end...
I will destroy it
with my own hands!"

If god doesn't exist
in our world, then...
I will create god
with my own hands!

Sophia
"Lacan! Live!"

Krelian
"Sophia!!
What are you doing!?"

Sophia
"I am ending this...
You won't need to fight
anymore...
So, Krelian...
Please open your fist...
and with your open hand
gently hold the people who
will continue to live..."

Lacan
"Don't be foolish!
We'll help you escape!
So please stop...!"

Sophia
"Thank you, Lacan...
But...sorry...
There's no other way..."

Lacan
"Elly!"

Sophia
"People support each other
to live... It's what brings
us happiness...
So share that happiness...
and please...
Lacan! Live!"

Lacan
"Ell~y!!"

Fei
"This is...that strange
old grandpa Chu-chu's
precious treasure...
I wonder what happened to
him when Shevat crashed
down to earth...
I haven't seen him...
His treasure...
Can we just take it...?
I'm sure he won't mind
if we just borrow it..."

Fei
"Just borrowing it.
Just borrowing it.
Hey, it's not like
we're grave robbers
or anything!
Right!?
So don't hex us,
or haunt us, OK!
Please...we're
begging you."

Fei
"Huh!
This is..."

The mythical 'RPS Badge'!!

The 'H&S Badge' of legend!!

The 'Tag Badge' that even
collectors go crazy over!!

Fei
"I bet that old Chu-chu guy
must have been so happy...
It was displayed
so nicely here...
I can't take
this from him."

Fei
"I bet that old Chu-chu
guy must have been so
very happy...
It's polished,
so shiny...
and displayed so
nicely here..."

Fei
"Huh. It looks like a
bunch of little kid's
toys all lined up...
It's pointless to take such
things when we don't even
know what's going to happen
to this world."

Fei
"This isn't the time
to be looking at
such things as this."

Do you want to go down?
    Yes
    No

 Received a
Vivid Turban!!

Received some
Speed Shoes!!

 Received a
Hero Costume!!

 Received a
HerculesRing!!

 Received a
Yamato Belt!!

 Received a
WizardryRing!!

Fei gently put the badge
back where he found it.

There may be a few things
we can do.
But I've been a soldier
all my life.
I can't sit still as
long as there are
people to protect and
enemies to fight.

...It's a different system
from what humans have been
creating. In other words,
it should be called a
machine made by non-humans.

It wasn't made by humans.
That I can see. But what I
want to know is if it's a
machine to begin with.

It doesn't matter whether
it's a machine or a
creature. Nothing can't be
broken. The question is
how we can damage it.

Be quiet!
Sister!
Please take the
children elsewhere.

You want the children to
stand in the cold hallway!?
This is the warmest room.
Why can't they stay here?

We're having a very
important meeting.
They're disturbing us.

Please don't get so upset.
I really appreciate that
you're trying to protect
us.
But you know those people
are the only ones who can 
change our fate...
don't you?

Really, how can we fight
against an enemy like that?

You think it's just going to
sit there while we gather
all of Aveh's and Kislev's
armies...?

I'm prepared to protect
everyone here.

I want to help people.
But all I know how to
do is fight.

I had doubts about fighting
before, but not about
protecting the people here.

If we had more weapons...

We gotta do what we can.

The children are annoying,
but, they're the reason
why I'm here.

Kids are all the same
in Kislev, Aveh and Nisan.

We both no longer have
anything to lose.
Do as you wish.
I hope you'll have
help from heaven.

Now more than ever I feel
as if each child is very
important.

This is the first time
I've seen snow.
It's so light and white,
and a beautiful pattern
appears for an instant
then it melts on my palm.
It's amazing...

I wanna see my mom and dad.

What is it?
Can I do that too?

Her outfit is so cute,
isn't it?

My grandma made this for
my mom when she was a
child. It's really warm.

Good luck to you too.
I...will protect these
people, so don't worry.

Uh...I'll play with
the sister.

I am Yggdrasil X!
Come on! Catch me
if you can!

Hey!
Give my candy back!

Hans
"Geez...
When it comes to him..."

Fei
"So, what's happened with
you lately. I didn't know
you had a son?
The kid who just left...
seemed pretty angry about
something."

Hans
"I'm embarrassed you just
saw that.
I got married just before
the Thames went down."

Hans
"Her name is Anna. She's
my wife. She was saved by
the Thames when the ships
were attacked by Reapers.
Unfortunately, that's when
she lost her husband...
Don't misunderstand me.
It wasn't out of feeling
sorry for her or anything
like that... Or...
Well, perhaps it was...
I just wanted to protect
her, that's all. If you
call that feeling sorry,
then I suppose I don't
mind.
The Captain teased me
mercilessly. He said...
 'What! A cold guy like
 you, seducing a widow?
 Just make sure the kid
 doesn't hate you...'
Ha, ha... I guess the
Captain was right.
My stepson doesn't like
me yet. 
But I'm hoping someday..."

Fei
"I see...
Boy, you've changed!"

Hans
"Ha, ha. You've changed
too, Fei. I don't know
how to explain it, but...
As for me...well, I don't
know what it is...
I guess I've always had
someone protecting me..."

Fei
"Hans..."

Hans
"Fei, I believe..."

Hans
"I believe that one day,
the Captain will come
down that stairway...
Tap-tap-tapping
with his cane..."

Hans
"And he'll say...
 'Haaaans! It looks like
 we'll get our hands on
 a priceless treasure!
 What kind of face is
 that? You don't believe
 me, huh? This time it's
 true...honest!'"

Hans
"...Maybe
someday..."

Captain
"Haaaans! It looks like
we'll get our hands on
a priceless treasure!"

!

Captain
"What kind of
face is that!?"

Hans
"Ca, ca, cap..."

Hans
"Captain------!!"

Hans
"What's this shouting out
'Ca,ca captain------!!'?
Cut it out, you fool!"

Hans
"Do, you know how much I
was worried about you!?"

Captain
"Hah!
I've been telling
you all along.
Don't you get it?
Now listen..."

Captain
"Men...!"

Captain
"Of the sea...!"

Captain
"Never say die!"

Captain
"Gha, ha, ha, ha-a-a-a!!"

Hans
"You...are...
such...a...."

Captain
"Hans!
This time it's true!
It's an island with
buried treasure.
It's called 'Duneman
Isle'.
An ancient hero defeated
a monster there, and now
legend has it, his fabled
sword rests there."

Hans
"What info. do you have...?
Do you know where the place
is? What about a ship?"

Captain
"Don't know where it is!
Don't have a ship!
Don't worry with details!
Don't you know that
attitude of yours is why
that kid won't take to
you?"

Hans
"That's none of
your business!"

Captain
"Well, by the time that
kid actually decides to
like you...
I'll have managed to get
a new ship. Till then,
give it all for your
family, lad!!
Give your family the
love they need while you
still have the chance.
Ghar, har, har!!"

Anna
"It hasn't been that long
since my husband died...
Please don't think I'm a
loose woman... But it's
because of this man that
I...(blush)..."

Lance
"He is teaching me
about the spirit of
the men of the sea!"

Lance
"I wish you were my dad.
Can I call you Dad?"

Captain
"Ghar, har, har!
That's a laugh...
A walrus with a
penguin for a son!
Ghar, har, har!"

Lance
"I'm not a penguin!
I'm a dolphin!!"

Captain
"Oh?
Hans is a penguin."

Lance
"My dad is a dolphin, too!
Oops... Forget what I just
said. I didn't mean to call
him dad! Who would want a
father like him!"

Captain
"Ghar, har, har, ha-a-a!!"

Lance
"I'll never call
him 'Dad'."

Kanna
"Enough, enough!
I give in, already!
I'm no match for you."

Kanna
"Some flashy woman in
Thames taught me a card
game.
Do you wanna play?"
    Yes
    No thanks

Then it's a challenge!

Chicken.

You're not my dad!!

Lance!!

Fei
"Hans!
Is that you!?"

Hans
"You...!
You're alive!?"

Fei
"Yeah, you too...
But if you're here that
means the Thames was..."

Hans
"The Thames...
sank.
The 'Angels' attacked...
The Thames withstood the
onslaught of Reapers, but
was defenseless against
those 'Angels'...
Hardly anyone got out in
time... They went down
with the Thames..."

Bart
"Wha...wait a minute.
What about the Captain?
He's okay, right?"

Fei
"What...? By the way,
where is the Captain?
What happened to him?"

Hans
"The Captain...said...he'd
watch the end of the Thames
with his own eyes..."

Bart
"Y, you're kidding, right?
That ol' guy died...
No way..."

Fei
"The Captain's dead...
No, that can't be..."

Hans
"No!
The Captain is alive.
He is the kind that
never keels over..."

...

Captain
"What? How did I survive?
Don't worry about those
minor details!!
If you worry about such
things then kids'll hate
you, just like they hate
Hans, heh!"

Everyone's gonna die!!
Booze!!
Bring booze-e-e-e-e!!

Hey you, it's freezing
in here. Can't you do
something? This is not
good for my complexion!

Plenty of good men are
dead now...
What kind of doctor am I
if I can't save people dying
right in front of me!?
Why should an old man like
me survive that...

Everyone's down, and
they're the only ones
looking happy.
Annoying, isn't it?

A town without prisoners...
How boring.
But then again, the world
itself is like a prison.

Kanna
"I give up!
I never thought I'd lose
five times in a row.
You're pretty good.
I'll give you this."

 
 Received 

Kanna
"Gee, you're good!!
You're having a  game
winning streak!!
Do you wanna continue?"
    Sure
    No thanks

Kanna
"Your winning record will
be wiped out if you do.
Is that okay?"
    Continue the game
    No, I'll stop

Kanna
"Hey!
Are you running away
with the winnings?"

Kanna
"You're good."

Kanna
"You're real good!
Here, take this..."

 
 Received 

Kanna
"Do you wanna continue?"
    Sure
    No thanks

Kanna
"You're no good.
Come back later."

Kanna
"Hum, pretty good.
Well, it's a tie
so far for today.
Do you wanna continue?"
    Sure
    No thanks

Kanna
"Your winning record will
be wiped out if you do.
Is that okay?"
    Continue the game
    No, I'll stop

Kanna
"Hey!
Are you running away?"

I have a stupid son you
know. He used to fish
for a living but one day
he said he saw a merman
city on the sea floor...
Since then he hasn't gone out to
sea, he's become a landlubber...
We haven't seen him these past
few years, I don't know what
he's doing now.

Hey, you have a rare
stone there too!
Is it a mermaid's tear...?
They're tough to find.
And you, girl... You have the
most amazing eyes.
Like they're an ocean treasure
or something... So, let me 
borrow that stone for a bit.

Long ago, I used to
be a famous designer.
See, it's ready.

You can take this. Good luck.
Just don't get taken in by
any strange men, now love!

 Received a
Mermaid Ring!

Hey, you have a rare
stone there too. Is it
a mermaid's tear...?
They're tough to find.
My son wore one as a good
luck charm. I wonder if
there is a girl out there
fit to wear your stone?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1988
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know why but
recently, families
keep increasing.

I wasn't planning on living
here, but my son's family
is with me.

I never thought I'd live
here...I wanted to make
my parents happy.

After losing our home in
Kislev...we lost our home
in Aveh, too. So we decided
to stay here for a while.
But next time, I want to
live somewhere that's green.

It's not bad. There are
a lot of people, and it's
fun to play in the snow.

I like this house because
there are lots of cats!

This isn't bad at all
compared to military camp
and the cat house.

We had a hard time
evacuating because my
daughter begged us to take
all the cats with us.

It's tremendously lonely
without cats.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1990
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't wanchu to think...
what am I doing at a time
like this... If I don't do
this, I can't keep my
composure!

Yahoo!!

Oh, brother Billy!
We barely made it out
with our lives.
We hadn't seen Primera
in a while and now she
can talk.
We're so surprised!

But, we won't be able to
launch or play with your
Gear anymore...
We're gonna miss that...

Billy
"Yes, that is unfortunate,
but now you've got a lot of
friends here, right Bobby?
Didn't you say your goal
was to 'make 100 friends
this year'? Well, you will
have to make them here."

Uh huh!
But, someday I'd like to
launch your new Gear,
Billy!

Dis is the first time for
me to see snow and boy is it
cowld, shlippery, and fuuun!!

Just when I thought I
could ride the UFO, it's
not flying anymore!!
On top of that this guy
keeps saying annoying stuff!

We are to be judged!!
The last day is nigh...
You too should be careful.
It's all according to 
prophecy...

I've heard rumors that a
part of Nortune, the old
capital of Kislev survived!
I wonder if they're still
conducting that barbaric
'Bartelling' thing...?
Really, I ask you, what
are we to do with our
menfolk these days...?

Just when I thought
Prince Bartholomew would 
return and bring peace
to the land of Aveh...
Just goes to show, you
never know what might
happen in this world...

Oh Queen... What do you see
with those eyes...
That look of sorrow, as if
you've lost something...
But within that, there
lies a kindness which
would forgive all...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's something...
Though it's a little
different from the
treasure I am
searching for.

I'm digging like crazy.
I can't wait till
I find something!

Nope...
Didn't find anything.
It always felt like it was
just beyond my grasp...

Hey, you have some Gold
Bullion there don't you?
If you give it to me I'll
try digging a little more.
Otherwise it looks like
I'll have to  give up...
What do you think?

Hand over Gold Bullion?
    Hand it over
    No way

Okay!
I'll get digging right now.
Expect something good!

Handed over Gold Bullion.

Really?
Well, do what
ever you like.

This rock is harder than I
thought. It's hard to dig,
so you'll have to wait a
little bit more.

Hmmmm...
I think I smell treasure
over here.

Hey, don't you have a
Gold Nugget?
If you give it to me,
I'll dig some more here.
I'm sure something
good will come up.
How about it?

Hand over Gold Nugget?
    Hand it over
    No way

Alright, got it!
Well, I'll try digging
around here then...
Expect something good!

Handed over Gold Nugget.

Really?
Well, do what
ever you like.

Hey, I've got all kinds
of good stuff here.
Hey, you need anything?

Hey, many thanks!
Come on back anytime you
need anything...hey!?

Hey-hey, welcome.
What can I do for
you today, hey?

Hey, thanks.
Come again.

It's gotten awfully cold.
I hate the cold!
It's killing me...
If the temperature keeps
dropping like this, we'll
all be frozen before Deus
can finish us off.

Us people of Shevat have
always dreamed of coming
down to live on the
planet's surface...
But we didn't ever imagine
this would be how we would
realize that dream!
...This is unbearable!

Though this base is the
last refuge for humans...
as you can no doubt see we
have almost no supplies.
Anyway, we're using a
fallen piece of Shevat
as the main base...
But you probably could
have guessed that, huh.
If we can take out Deus
even one day sooner...
We can't hold out much
longer like this.

Aveh, Kislev, Nisan...
We've been feuding for such
a long time, but finally we
are coming together as one
like this...
But it's probably already
too late...
It's always the case.
By the time we notice 
anything, it's way too late.
How could we possibly
stand up to god's army?
The situation's
really hopeless.

So many have died...
If this continues,
even more will die.
It's the same as 500 years
ago. That tragedy and
hardship is being repeated
again...
What's going to happen
to our world...
What's going to happen
to us...!

Burn, burn...!
Burn up this
whole world...!
My home, my whole family,
everything's been
destroyed by them...
Who cares anymore,
burn it all up!!
Hahahaha...

It's not like we're
born just to die...?
What's going to
happen to us now? 
To this world...
We can't carry on without
at least drinking...
It's scary and lonely...

Did you say you still
needed something else?

Hey buddy, did you
need something?
If you need something
come talk to me at the
counter.
I have to make things
really clear or else
it gets on my nerves.

Hey buddy!
You need something?
Hey, hang on a minute!

Thanks.
Come again and I'll
give you a better deal.
(Yeah... Better you 
than me... Haha!)

I'm not giving you your
money back! They ran away
after I sold them to you.

Hey, aren't these Picotiles
cute? They're going 'cheap,
cheap' too! How about it?

Wanna buy my Picotiles?
    Buy Picotiles!
    Don't buy any

Alright!
20000G for the lot!
And no haggling for a
discount! So pay up!

Forced to pay 20000G.

Thanks.
They're really delicious
if you grill them...

Aaaaaaaah...!!

I know nothing!
...Nothing!

You don't have enough money.
Well maybe next time then...
'Cheepskate'!

Tsk, are you mocking me?
This isn't a game you know!
Get outta here!

Argh! Burning! Burning!
All of my rare first
edition books and
valuable autographs!!
I know supplies are short,
but I can't believe they
are burning my treasures!

Do you want to go up?
    Yes
    No

I guess I wasn't supposed
to have used this...
I'm sorry I caused you so
much trouble.
Your lil' brother was
really mad at me. 
He asked us whether
we had hearts or not.
I envy you having a
brother with enough guts
to be honest.

Fei
"It's alright, Dan.
...Enough already.
I understand.
It is my fault.
I'm sorry I caused
you such pain..."

Fei
"I'm just glad that I could
finally make peace with
you. Take care, kiddo."

Fei
"Midori! I had better give
this back to you... It's 
your precious ring, right?
Be a good little girl,
and listen to your mother,
Yui, alright, Midori!
Oh and...
look after Dan
for me, OK!?"

Fei
"Yeah...
I guess you're right!"

Fei
"Okay...
Well, I'm going now.
So see you later!"

Dan
"..."

Dan
"In the prison, when I saw
you change into a monster,
I understood everything.
Living inside of you, Fei,
there is a monster that's
not you... He's the bad
one... He's to blame..."

Dan
"So...to forgive you, or
not to forgive you... Well
...that's not the problem!
It's not like it's gonna
turn back things the way
they were...but...
errh, it's just...
I don't know how to say it
properly, but I'm sorry...
I...I, errh...
I...!"

Dan
"..."

Midori
"Be careful, Fei."

Midori
"Fei...
I was scared a little,
but not really scared.
Cause I knew that inside
of that monster, you were
doing all you could to
fight it, Fei. I knew it."

Midori
"Yep, we, 
are all fine.
Fei, you be
careful too.
I'm sure your
voice will reach
her too, Fei..."

Midori
"Here...
I got this
from Chu-chu.
Fei, you can 
have it.
I'll trade you
for my ring."

  Received a
Hercules Ring!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

So this is where
Fei's being held!?
He deserves it!

Dan
"Let me pray on his weeping
face as if it were an idol!
Heh, heh... As if I would!"

...Gah!
Argh...!!

St...stop...
Stop... it!!

D a n...
Mi do ri...!

R...run...
Hurry...
Run a...way!!

Dan
"Yech...!
What,
what is this...!?"

Dan
"...
This is terrible..."

Dan
"No matter what,
this is going
way too far...
He's still...
alive...?
How could you
possibly be!?
You're human too,
aren't you!?
Darn...!"

Dan
"...
Fei...
Oh, Fei...!?"

Dan
"Huh...!?"

Dan
"Midori, it's you...
Phew...
Don't scare me like that!"

Dan
"Crying...?
Who's crying?
...!?"

Dan
"You mean our friend
Fei is crying?"

Dan
"What do you mean!?"

Dan
"Whoa...!
What the...!?"

Dan
"Fei!?"

Dan
"Yikes...!?"

Crying...

Midori
"Angry...
Hurt...
He'll wake up soon...
It's calling him..."

There's nothing here.
He's long gone already.
But, wow, to make
a hole this big...

Fei
"Elly will be back to
her usual self! I will
go on believing that.
But even if that doesn't
happen...I will still...
...Well, let's just say
I'm prepared for that too!"

Zephyr
"You don't have to do
this if you don't want
to, you know.
Your opponent is the
person you love...
If you decide to quit now,
no one will blame you."

Fei
"To quit would be
meaningless.
All that I have fought for,
and all that I live for,
would come to have no
meaning at all...
People should be free. With
no one bound by others, and
no one binding others...
Inside of me, there is a
part of me that desires
that freedom, and a part
of me that gives me hope.
So, I shall fight to
win true freedom!
For we are still alive!
We fight to live.
That is the reason
why I fight.
It's proof I'm human.
I promised my father, and
myself too, that I would
free Elly from Deus' binds,
that I would save her..."

Zephyr
"I understand.
So, let's keep believing...
And hope for a miracle..."

Fei
"According to what the doc
says, his condition has
gotten a lot better.
It seems like Kahr has
regained his will to
live again."

Fei
"So much has happened
between him and I...
When this battle ends, I
want to face Ramsus one
on one in sport, not war,
as a martial artist."

Fei
"Perhaps..."

Citan
"Yes, well, at first, he
had lost faith in himself
but now he is better.
Kahr has revived himself,
and has found some real
meaning in his life.
If he decides to fight on
our side then our total
fighting power shall be
greatly increased."

Zephyr
"The snow keeps falling...
Softly covering up
everything in this world...
Our sorrow, our defilement,
our mistakes... If only we
could wipe away these
things as easily as that...
What have we...have I...
been doing...
been pursuing...
for these past 500 years?"

Zephyr
"By the way...
How is the person you
rescued from Merkava?
I heard he recovered
consciousness..."

Zephyr
"I am sure he wishes
the same thing too."

Zephyr
"Fei...
May I ask you something?
About Elly...
What if, even if we break
Zohar's spell, she doesn't
return to normal..."

Use that sword and
make them pay!

I'm a celebrated Gear
weapons specialist...
But lately there's been
no interesting work...
There are no men with
enough guts to ask me
to forge them a weapon
to fight Deus...
If you bring me a nifty
sword, I can forge it into
something truly amazing
for you, anytime...
But I won't work for
anyone rude enough
to ask me to check a
weapon while it's still
equipped to their Gear!

Ohh...the Kishin!
You sure have a
novel sword.
Looks interesting!
Lemme take a peek!

This came out great!
It was like turning
plowshares into a
sword!
Use this sword and
make Deus and his
legions pay!

'Kishin' sword was enhanced!

Received 'Kijin' sword!

It's 1006.

"Okay, here we go!"

Elly
"...!
Fei, look!"

Elly
"Do you think we need to
use that gate to get to
the lower floor?"

Elly
"Here we go, Fei."
    Jump in the gate
    Not yet

Elly
"What, is this?"

Elly
"Let's investigate it."

Citan
"Fei, there..."

Citan
"We might be able to
get to a lower floor
through that gate."

Citan
"Shall we go Fei?"
    Jump in the gate
    Not yet

Citan
"What might this be...?"

Citan
"Fei, we should
investigate this."

Citan
"Fei, over there..."

Citan
"We might be able to
get to a lower floor

Citan
"Shall we go, Fei?"

"Hey, Fei. Look over
there!" 

Bart
"It looks like we can
go down through there."

Bart
"Fei, let's go."

    Not yet 

Bart
"What the..." 

Bart
"Let's check it out."

"Huh? Over there..." 

Billy
"I believe we must go

I've been waiting
for you, Fei!!

Ramsus
"Fei...
If only you hadn't
have been born..."

"I...
I...
We're going to
settle this now!!"

Fei
"Stop it, Ramsus!
What reason is there to
continue fighting me!?
Who are you fighting for!?
Why do you always have a
bone to pick with me!?
Tell me why!"

Ramsus
"It is all because of
you...
If only you hadn't come
in and destroyed my
prospects in life..."

My life...was given to
me within a Nanoreactor
in Krelian's laboratory. 
To be born as the superior
being, above all humans...
But then...

Ramsus
"Because of your existence,
I was discarded...!
I was destined to be the
representative of god...
having the might of the
Emperor.
I was destined to be the
ultimate existence, having
the power to exercise
absolute control over all!
But...
I lost it all...
because of you!!"

Fei
"M, my mother...?
How...do you know her...?
Ramsus...!"

Dominia
"Commander!
Please stop this!
Commander, if what you
say is true, then that
is even more of a reason
not to fight!
You were just used by
Krelian and..."

Ramsus
"Silence!!
You...even you...
dare to censure me!?
I saved you from nearly
becoming a test subject
and now you turn on me!?"

Dominia
"You are mistaken!
We are only thinking of
your best interests..."

Ramsus
"Silence!!
Ultimately, only
I can help myself!
I am the only one that
can correct this!"

Ramsus

Fei battles Miang at Deus Resurrection Site - file85
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Miang
"Heh... Well then...,
let's start over from
the beginning again.
You think you can
beat me this time?"

Fei
"What the...!?
I thought I
defeated you...!?"

Krelian
"Unless you can
decompose her atomic
structure,
you don't stand much
of a chance.
Normal attacks are
futile against one who
has the ability to
regenerate
using nanomachines."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miang
"This is the true meaning
of the -Anima Relics-...
To attain their respective
-Animus- and return to the
-Persona-.
The Anima Relics are really
one set of parts that make
up -Deus-, the physical
manifestation of god.
They regain their original
powers or functions by
aligning themselves with
their destined partner...
An Omnigear that has lost
its respective Anima Relic,
is but a puppet.
It becomes a mere vessel
or container in which there
are no contents."

Krelian
"And this girl too was
destined to become one
with god...
You see...Elyhaym is
really one of the parts
of god as well..."

Krelian
"Put simply, you served to
help bring all the parts of
god together, here, for me.
You're a bunch of stupid
fools. It's as if you're
all clowns..."

Miang
"You believed the legend
of how our world and the
universe was created...
But the Ministry and I
fabricated that very myth
a long time ago to suit
our purposes."

Miang
"I think you'll find that
your friends' Omnigears
are all dead too...
I'm talking about your
friends who split up and
took a different path than
you into this place...
They were all parts of god
that were disassembled in
the past, but once again,
are all gathered here."

Krelian
"Yes.
It is indeed the time for
the resurrection of god."

W, what was it all for...
Everything that I have
done up until now...

Fei
"What is this...?
...!!
That's Elly!!"

Fei
"Damn,
what's going on!?
Huh!?
Hey...
Is that...!?"

Fei
"Our Omni...?
No, that's not it!!
Is that...
our Anima Relics!?"

Fei
"Being consumed by...
Deus...!?"

Fei
"Deus is...
swallowing up our
Anima Relics!?"

Fei
"What the hell are
you talking about!?"

Fei
"That's a lie!!
How can that be true...?"

Citan
"Gwah...!
Could...this be the!?"

Bart
"W, what the!?
M, my body...
It feels like it's
bein' torn apart!!"

Bart
"It, it's...
pulling me in...!!"

Bart
"What's going on?
My Omnigear...
won't move!?
It's like it's
dead...!?"

Rico
"Gwah...!?
Wh, what's this
terrible pain...!?"

Rico
"That Deus thing!?
Is it trying swallow us!?"

Rico
"Crap, what's going on?
My Omnigear won't move!
It's like it's...dead."

Billy
"Argh...!?
I'm getting torn apart!?"

Billy
"That thing...!
That thing is trying...
to eat us all!?"

My Omnigear...
It's not moving.
I think it's dead..."

"...?
What's wrong!?"

Maria
"Uh...!!
What's this...!?"

Citan
"It is our...
Omnigears!?"

Citan
"Is it trying to detach
the Anima Relics from
our Omnigears!?"

Citan
"...
It seems the Anima Relics
have fallen into the hands
of the enemy."

"Fei, sorry we're late.
Our Omnigears broke down.
Anyway, let's hurry up
and save Elly!"

Rico
"Too bad we missed the
action. Our Omnigears
gave out on the way here.
Anyways...
Let's hurry up and save
Elly!"

"Forgive us for being late.
My Omnigear gave out on the

Well, anyway, let us hurry

save Elly!"

"What are you talking
about!? Why does Elly
have to be sacrificed!?"

Fei
"Ah!?"

Fei
"Ramsus!?"

Fei
"Yes, I know!"

Fei
"Hang in there, Elly!
I'm letting you down now."

Krelian
"I would have liked to
have been able to commend
you for making it here...
But your efforts were all
in vain.
The resurrection of -Deus-
is imminent.
Sacrificing this girl will
bring about the awakening
of 'god'."

Krelian
"There's no need for you
to know. For all of you,
it will all end here..."

Krelian
"Hmph...
It's just you..."

Krelian
"A pathetic excuse for a
life.
Why, you aren't even human!
Kahaha...
Hah hahaha...!"

Krelian
"..."

Miang
"What are you doing
here, Kahr?"

Miang
"There was only one purpose
to your existence...
To eliminate Emperor Cain.
Cain's will had become too
much like that of humans'.
He was too concerned about
them.
He had forgotten his
mission to revive god.
That is why you were
created.
You were only made
to remove our main
hindrance...Cain.
But, as the original
living being, Cain
had absolute power.
To make you turn on
Cain, it was necessary
to focus your mind on
a single point.
However, being an
artificial life form, you
were mentally unstable.
That is why...we used
Fei's existence.
Resentment... That is the
source of your strength.
And you have excelled
superbly at fulfilling
our expectations of you.
But...we no longer have
any more use for you.
Haven't you realized that
yet?
You're a piece of trash.
And being the reject that
you are, why don't you just
leave? Hah hah hah."

Miang
"Now, what to do with the
lot of you...
Well, I can't just kill
you all...seeing as you
have served me so well.
So, as a reward, I'll allow
you to be sacrificed too...
To be assimilated into Deus
along with this girl..."

Miang
"Guhh...!?"

Miang
"Good...
This is how I wanted it,
Kahr...
I am fated so as not to
be able to kill myself...
Now...all...my...wishes
have...come...true.
Thanks...to...you...!"

Ramsus
"What about me...?
My existence...
What was its purpose?"

Ramsus
"I... I...
What was I born for?
What was I living for?"

Ramsus
"...
Miang..."

"Uh, uhaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"

Billy
"Sh, she took my gun...!?"

Bart
"W, why did
you do that,
Elly...?"

Citan
"Elly!?
What happened to you!?
How could you!?"

Bart
"Don't tell me
she's been...
brainwashed!?"

Krelian

with brainwashing..."

Citan
"Unify with

Krelian
"That girl...Elhaym,
is our 'mother'."

Elly

I am the mother of
all humans..."

Fei
"Elly...!?"

Bart
"What are you babbling
on about!?
Snap out of it, Elly!!"

Elly
"You're as dense as
usual... But, I don't
blame you...
So be it.
I will explain to
you all about it."

Elly
"This Deus, the one you call
god, is an 'inter-planetary
invasion weapon system' that
was built in ancient times by
humans from another planet.
It was created as an automatic
weapon which could act upon
its own will to take control
of a targeted planet. But you
should've known this much from
looking at the Razael records.
Anyway, during a test run,
Deus became uncontrollable.
It released its power and
annihilated a whole planet.
The creators of 'Deus' found
its immeasurable power to be
too much of a threat and hence
forcibly shut it down.
In order to analyze the cause
of the problem, its core was
dismantled and placed on an
inter-planetary emigrant
passenger ship to be
transported to another planet.
Becoming aware of this, the
dissasembled Deus resisted.
It tried to  take over the
passenger ship that was
transporting it.
However, as a last line of
defense against the escape
of Deus, its creators,
unexpectedly destroyed the
whole ship, sending it
crashing to this planet.
Deus knew that it would not
be able to get away from the
explosion or the imminent
impact and so it detached its
core from the 'Zohar' power
reactor."

Fei
"Zo...har...?"

Elly
"Yes, 'Zohar'...
It is what drives all of
the Gears on this planet.
It is the master generator
that transmits its energy
to the slave generators
in our Gears.
It is also the source of
all the Ether power that
the inhabitants of this
planet utilize.
By utilizing the energy
displacements caused by
actualizing potential
future phenomenon...
...this 'Zohar Modifier'
has the ability to produce
infinite amounts of
energy."

Bart
"The source of all
our Ether power!?"

Citan
"Are you saying all our
energy comes from that one
power reactor or engine?"

Elly
"Yes, but there is more...
The core that was detached 
from Zohar, the 'Biological
Computer Kadomony' crashed
onto this primitive planet.
It activated -Persona-,
its life support plant,
that can generate organic
material.
Using this it prepared for
itself a genetic-based
system for the day when
Deus would be resurrected.
Thus, the first humans were
created from there...
Emperor Cain and the elders
of the Gazel Ministry."

Rico
"Are you saying the Emperor
and them Gazel geezers were
people born from Deus!?"

Elly
"Do you know why the Gazel
Ministry desired the Anima
Relics and your bodies?
Well, here's the reason...
Before becoming human, the
bodies of the Ministry were
once part of the organic
elements in the core circuit
that made up 'Deus'.
There were two types of
organic elements.
The female type was called
'Anima', while the male
type was called 'Animus'.
They were also created with
the added ability to become
mobile weapons by merging
with machinery that was
suited for use as terminal
interface weapons for Deus.
In other words, those
Omnigears you were using
were one form of such
weapons.
The Ministry, which were
Animus, were to become one
again with their separated
Anima at the time of the
resurrection of god...
But, in a war 500 years ago,
they all lost their physical
bodies.
It was then that they
decided to extract their own
genetic factor from certain
individuals of their human
descendants who carried the
appropriate sets of D.N.A..
All so each of them could
become one with their
respective Anima again."

Maria
"Descendants!?"

Bart
"Then we're all...!?"

Elly
"Yes, you humans are all
descendants of Cain and
the Gazel Ministry...
They were born from the
-Persona-, gave birth,
and propagated.
They followed their
inbuilt program to
someday resurrect the
heavily damaged Deus."

Citan
"All the people in the
world were created solely
to resurrect Deus!?"

Elly
"Yes.
But it wasn't just to
restore its old body.
More than half of Deus is
constructed of biological
parts. Do you remember
those mutated humans?
Those are all people who
were destined to become
replacement parts for
Deus."

Billy
"We humans are...
parts for god..."

Elly
"Yes, almost all the
people are destined to
become parts for Deus.
But you people gathered
here are all different.
You could say...you
escaped that destiny by
existing through multiple
generations...
In actuality, there wasn't
enough parts for Deus...
But, Krelian compensated
for what was lacking.
The reduction in the number
of parts, was due to humans
living through multiple
generations...
But that deficiency in the
human factor, was made up
for by the nanomachines
created by Krelian.
Not only that, but his
nanomachines added
additional functions.
Deus has thus evolved into
the perfect weapon.

Fei
"Elly...
What has happened...?
Why...do you know
all...that...?"

Elly
"I am Miang. The keeper of
time. The representative of
our god -Deus-.
I was born to guide the
people toward the path of
the resurrection of Deus."

Bart
"That's ridiculous!
Miang was just..."

Elly
"You're limited in your
ability to understand...
Miang's factor exists
within all women.
The one who trascends the
generations, the caretaker
of humans.
When the previous one dies,
somewhere another Miang is
awakened.
It is programmed into all
womens' DNA to be that way.
Who inherits the duty is
just a matter of
probability, Fei.
That Miang over there and
I are the same existence. 
We are all parts of Deus...
All caretakers of humans."

Elly
"Let us end this
discussion now. 
Deus has awakened.
I am one of the parts
that composes Deus.
Hence, I must become
one with it."

Citan
"Elly!
Why did it have to be
you?
If Miang is a part for
Deus, why did it not
happen earlier...?"

Krelian
"It's still not enough
for her just to have
awakened.
Although she may be
Miang, she still isn't
the 'true Miang'."

Citan
"The 'true Miang'...?"

Elly
"Let's go, Krelian.
All that is left to do is
to vanquish this planet's
civilization and return
it to how it was.
Then I can complete my
unification with the
final fragment of Deus...
the 'Zohar Modifier'...
The power reactor that
fell upon this planet and
became our genesis, and
now, our apocalypse..."

Citan
"The eradication of
civilization!?
What is the purpose
of doing that!?"

Elly
"Who knows...?
The creations of god will
someday be a hindrance.
That is why they must be
eliminated.
I am just programmed to
act in this way..."

Krelian
"Come...
It is time for
the awakening of
the true 'mother'."

Fei
"Please...
wait...
Elly...!"

Elly
"Farewell...Fei.
May you have a peaceful
'awakening'..."

Citan
"Fei!
Now you hang
in there!"

Krelian
"The majority of my
body is comprised of
a nanomahine colony.
Not only for longevity
...but also to unify
with the 'mother'...
So don't be surprised.
This much damage can
be recovered rather
quickly."

Fei
"This

Fei
"...
Thanks everyone.
To attack Deus directly...
or, to take out its
supports first...
I wonder which is best?"

Citan
"As I thought...
The power of
Xenogears..."

Bart
"Do we need the power
of Xenogears?"

Billy

The power of...
Xenogears..."

Xenogears?..."

Maria
"I knew it...
The power of
Xenogears..."

Emeralda
"I knew it...
The power of...
Xenogears..."

Citan
"Probably."

Citan
"Striking directly at the
center rather than using
fuel unnecessarily...
That is one strategy. But,
I believe another plan of
attack would be to defeat
its surroundings first.
If we decide to attack
the supporting orbs first,
then it might be wise to
leave the battles up to us.
We should be able to do
something about them
without using up Fei's
power."

Bart
"Who cares about those
orbs. Let's just crush
the core."

Billy
"Whether we do a direct
strike to the core or take
down the supports first...
I guess that is best left
up to Fei to decide..."

Rico
"So that means that big
thing in the middle is
the core of Deus?"

Emeralda
"That'll allow him to
use the full power of
Xenogears...
...To defeat Deus.
And yes, of course,
to save Elly!"

Chu-Chu
"What are those
four orbs spinning
around it?"

Maria
"It seems as if the power
of those four things is
supporting the center."

Fei
"What...happened?"

Rico
"My Gear won't
budge anymore."

Citan
"The Zohar Modifier
has ceased functioning.
That is probably the
reason why our Gears
cannot move anymore. 
There is only a slight
energy response coming
from the core now."

Fei
"What about Elly?
What's happening to her
inside of that thing?
The Deus system's bind
on her should have worn
off now. 
So why aren't we getting
any kind of response!?
You don't think we hurt her
in that battle too...!?"

Citan
"Fei, calm down!
The sensors are picking
up a response from a
life form within Deus.
It is probably Elly.
So do not worry...
I believe she is okay!"

Fei
"Elly!
Can you hear me, Elly!?
Deus is no longer active.
It's all over now...
So come out of there.
Show me your face! 
Elly! Elly!"

Bart
"W, what the...?
What's happening...!?"

Fei
"Doc!?
What's going on?
What's wrong?"

Citan
"I am now detecting a
tremendous amount of energy
coming from within Deus.
It seems as if something
that was sealed up till now
has suddenly been freed and
is growing enormously..."

Fei
"It couldn't be...
the 'Wave Existence'!?"

Bart
"The 'Wave Existence'?"

Fei
"That's gotta be it.
The 'Wave Existence' was
just freed from its 'cage
of fleshly existence' in
Zohar...
It's probably attempting
to return to the higher
dimension that it
originally came from."

Citan
"Which means...this is
the aftereffect of the
dimensional shift!?"

Rico
"What do you mean...
'aftereffect'!?"

Citan
"It is like a shock wave
that is induced by the
dimensional displacement.
But...so much energy!?
If this much energy is
unleashed here now..."

Fei
"...If so much energy is
unleashed...then what will
happen, doc!? Tell us!"

Citan
"...Then this planet
will be annihilated!
These numbers indicate
that it has more than
enough energy to take
out a whole planet!"

Chu-Chu
"Whatchu mean!?"

Bart
"You can't be serious!?"

Billy
"We all fought so
hard...only to see
this happen...!?"

Fei
"Isn't there...
isn't there anything
we can do?
Can't we stop the
aftereffect!?"

Citan
"Unfortunately, there
is nothing we can do...
Almost all machinery,
including our Gears, are
out of commission due to
Zohar having been shutdown.
This time, there is nothing
we can do...
To put it to you straight
...this is the end for us!"

Bart
"This is freakin' stupid!
How the hell could it all
end like this!?
What were we all fighting
for up to now!?"

Billy
"Th, the vibrations
are intensifying..."

Rico
"Hold on a sec...!
No, these vibrations
are different!
It has to be something
else causing it..."

Maria
"Look!"

Bart
"Deus is...!"

Fei
"Deus is rising!?"

Chu-Chu
"What is it
this time!?"

Citan
"Deus is releasing its
remaining energy and is
beginning to accelerate...
If it continues to
accelerate at this rate,
it will soon leave the
atmosphere..."

Fei
"You don't think...!?"

Bart
"Think what!?"

Fei
"That it's Elly!?
Elly is moving Deus...!"

Rico
"Are you sure!?"

Fei
"I'm sure of it!
Elly is trying to save
us by moving Deus away
from our planet!
She's going to
sacrifice herself..."

Maria
"That can't be...
Oh, Elly..."

Billy
"Can't we do anything...?
We can't just sit here and
watch this happen, can we?"

Citan
"..."

Fei
"Wait...
There is still
something I can do!"

Chu-Chu
"What is it, Fei!?"

Fei
"My Gear still works.
Without Zohar, the power
source for your Gears, the
only Gear that now remains
active is mine.
Just like Deus, my Gear
and I made contact with
Zohar. We are the only
one's who can move now.
I am going to go save
Elly!"

Citan
"That is absurd!
Even if you were able to
catch up to Deus, you will
not have enough energy to
make it back!"

Fei
"Even so, I still must go.
Elly's taking the whole
burden upon herself!
If anything happens to
her...
I want to be there with
her..."

Bart
"Hey!
Just wait a minute!
You know I'm not gonna
stand by and let you commit
double suicide...if that's
what you're planning!"

Fei
"Bart..."

Bart
"...
You better come back
alive, you hear!?
Promise me!!
Promise me that you
will come back...
Then I'll let you go!!"

Fei
"...Thanks, Bart.
I promise.
I promise you that
I will return...
with Elly!"

Bart
"You better."

Fei
"Yeah, of course!"

Bart
"Alright!
Then get goin'!"

Citan
"But...!"

Bart
"Let's let him go, Citan.
At this point, Fei's the
only one that'll be able
to bring Elly back.
There's nothing we can
say or do about it."

Citan
"...You are right. Fei,
keep your promise..."

Billy
"No matter what..."

Maria
"Fei and Elly..."

Emeralda
"Both of you..."

Rico
"Come back home..."

Chu-Chu
"We'll be waiting
for you chu!"

Fei
"I appreciate this...
Bart...
and the rest of you...
Well I had better get
going now...
But don't worry!
I will be back soon!"

Fei
"I guess this will be
the last journey you
and I make together...
I'm counting on you...
partner!"

Elly!!

 D:\Downloads\Xenogears\Xenogears English Script Text\game script files\field\2044.txt 

Where am I...!?

That's Elly!
This must mean that
I am inside of Deus!?

Not exactly.
Your actual body is but a
physical object... It has
merely been absorbed into
Deus' outer-shell.
Only your consciousness is
here.
Of course, the girl you
perceive in front of you is
also not a true being.
Your consciousness is merely
creating her image.

!?

The 'Wave Existence'...?
No...that's not you...!!
Who are you...?

It can't be...!?
Is that you Krelian!?
That's right, isn't it...!?
Krelian! It was you who did 
this to Elly!

The 'Path of Sephirot' has
been connected.
No one can stop god from
returning to his world now.
So what have you come here
for, Lacan?

I came here to take the
person I love back with me!
So set Elly free!
The Deus' system has been
destroyed.
It's all over now!
So instead I ask you...
What are you hoping to
achieve now!?

The time when all things
started...
The place where all things
were one...
I am going to return there!

What place?

Before the beginning of the
universe, in the undulating
waves of the higher dimension,
all things were one.
It was the waves spilling out
from there that created this
four-dimensional universe of
ours.
'Humankind' and the 'Souls of
Humankind' that were born from
there, are merely leftovers of
those spilled waves.
So...

You're going back there?
Is that what you desired?

Lacan...
Why such reluctance to
become one with the god?
What attachment could you
possibly have to this
wretched old world?
What meaning can be found
in living out such a short
existence...hurting others,
hurting yourself, grinding
one another down...only to
inevitably die and return
to dust?
Why, everything we could
ever desire is here...
No need to be troubled by
the need for love...
For this place is filled
with the love of god.

I have not lost hope in
humans as much as you have,
Krelian...
Someday humankind will come
to understand one another!
I sincerely believe that!

How can you be so sure?
Humans will never come to
understand each other.
You said that she is the
person you love.
But can you say that you
even truly understand
each other?
All humans do is place
themselves at a comfortable
distance from each other
and call that 'mutual under-
standing', 'spiritual unity',
or 'true love'...
but it is all lies!
Man cannot associate with
others without first
deceiving themselves.
That is the way that they
were created.

But one being's ego can't
determine everyone's fate!
People have the right to
choose their own destiny!
That is why humans have
free will!

And what if that 'will'
itself was predetermined?
What then?
Oh, what folly!?!
Humans are just primitive
life forms that have no
such things as free will...
Mankind has merely been
allowed to live in an
imperfect state...
"as is", "as will be"...
It is for this very reason...
because humans have this
wretched 'will' or whatnot...
that humans must experience
sadness and loss.
For someone to gain something
means another must lose it...
It is impossible to make
humankind share limited
"things" and "affections"...
So I came to the conclusion
that everything must be
reverted back to where it
all began.
To go back to when all was
one...
waves, and nothing else...
It is not my -Human's- ego...
It is the will of the 'Waves'
...the will of -god-...

Well that's alright, too...
We don't have to be perfect.
Actually, being imperfect
makes mankind live by
helping each other...
That's what being human is...
That's mutual understanding!
That's 'unity' and 'love'...
I'm glad...no, I'm proud...
to be human!

Elly placed the future,
-tomorrow-, in our hands,
based on our choice...
And she is working to keep
Deus far from our planet.
She is also trying to heal
your heart...
you, who wants to journey,
all alone, to be with god...
Can't you understand Elly's
feelings!?
Do you have to become one
with god before you are able
to comprehend all of this?
I understand...
I know her feelings...
as if they were my own...
Yes...she and I are one!
We don't need god's help!!

Well then, prove it to me...
Show me this power of humans!
Show me this -love-,
that you say can make you
independent of god...

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"Fei...
It was Krelian...
Krelian released me..."

Fei
"Krelian...?"

Elly
"Yes. I came to understand
after becoming one with
Krelian...
His heart was so full of
sadness. That is why he
desired for he and I to
become one with god...
Because that would be the
return to the beginning of
everything...
He told me...
"You should be with him..."
That is what he said...
You see...
He already knew!
Yes, he already knew...
how I felt, how you felt...
But there was nothing we
or he could do...
He had no choice but to go
forward... even if it meant
he lost all feelings, lost
everything that was human!
For all humankind's sake...
There was no going back...
Even looking back held too
many memories...
And he would have...
just wanted to go back...
Even though he couldn't...
So please forgive him...
Krelian loved people more
than anyone else..."

Fei
"I... 
I, somehow...
knew it all along...
I just knew he was really
that kind of person..."

Elly
"...I am so sorry...
Please forgive me!
I was wrong...
I thought sacrificing
myself in order to save
others was the right
thing to do...
But my actions only brought
sadness to all the people
who I left behind.
And that sadness gave birth
to even more sadness.
As long as 'I' still live
within you, my life is not
just mine alone."

Fei
"Elly...
That isn't wrong.
To sacrifice yourself for
others is a noble thing...
Even if it were to benefit
yourself, it's no problem.
There will always be a
person healed...
One or the other...
Love gains its original
shine only when there's an
interrelationship between
the giver and the receiver.
It is incomplete when one
or the other is missing...
The two are one.
It was you, Elly, who
taught me that.
I believe that is what it
means to be human...
I can now understand the
true importance of it.
I don't know if it's the
right answer or not...
But we have a lot of time
to think about it...
What Krelian himself was
looking for all along...
We will find the answer to
it all...ourselves..."

Elly
"Thank you...
Fei!"

Fei
"Elly..."
