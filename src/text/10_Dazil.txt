Fei
"This is...
Dazil..."

Citan
"Yes, that is right. 
The desert town of Dazil."

Fei
"This town's lively."

Citan
"This is the center for
all excavations in Aveh.
People come from all over
Ignas to try and find the
resources buried in the
ruins around here."

Citan
"We should be able to find
out what both Aveh and
Kislev are up to, here.
And we also have to gather
the things we need to
repair Weltall."

Fei
"Repair Weltall..."

Citan
"Yes. We must exchange
the broken parts to fix
Weltall...
Otherwise it will not be
able to function at all!
There is an 'Ethos'
workshop in the southern
part of this town.
Let us go there, Fei."

Fei
"Yeah, okay doc,
let's check this
place out then."

———————————————————————————————————

Entrance Guard
Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

You can't let up
even in peacetime.
We always have to keep 
working hard just in case.

This is the Aveh Army's
Dazil Guard Station.
No civilians allowed.
If you have no business
here, please leave.

This town is the center
of all Gear excavating 
in Aveh.
They take the generators
out of excavated Gear to
make new models.
Protecting this town is
essential to beating Kislev.
I left my family at home 
to come here. 
I want to finish my duty
here and go home.

My friend had family in
Bledavik, so he went back.
That's nice. At least he 
had someone waiting for him.
Me... I'm all alone...
I think I'll just cry
myself to sleep today.

The Kislev army is up
to something in the
land north of here.
But don't worry...
If anything happens,
Gebler will back us up.

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"The 'Ethos'? 
What do Gears have to
do with the 'Ethos'?"

Citan
"Only the 'Ethos' has the
technology to maintain
generator driven Gear.
The 'Ethos' decides which
Gear gets which generator
in which country..."

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"...
Doc, do you have a moment?
I need to talk to you."

Citan
"Yes, of course, Fei..."

Citan
"So Fei, what did you want
to talk to me about?"

Fei
"...
Well doc, it's about
Weltall...
We can't find the parts
we need, so is it alright
if we just don't fix it?"

Citan
"Do not repair it?
What is the problem, Fei?"

Fei
"Well, we've been able to
come as far as Dazil on
our own...
So doesn't that show that
we don't need Weltall
as much as we thought.
Actually, I've been
thinking that once things
cool down I want to go back
to Lahan and help rebuild.
That's all I feel I can
do now..."

Citan
"...I see.
If that is what you want,
Fei, then fine.
But I think we should
try and move Weltall
as far away from there
as possible."

Fei
"Move it away?
But why do we need
to do that, doc?"

Citan
"It is only my
speculation, but...
I suspect the incident that
evening occured because the
Gebler Special Force stole
a Kislev Military Gear."

Fei
"Special Force...
You mean Elly's group?"

Citan
"Exactly.
When I examined the broken
Gear in the village, I
realized the Gebler pilot
was riding a Kislev Gear.
It must have had some new
technology involved in it
for the Kislev army to send
pursuit forces after it."

Fei
"New technology?"

Citan
"I suspect that the Gebler
Force was out to steal a
new experimental Gear."

Citan
"I am sure news of the
Special Force's failure
has reached the capital.
They will be investigating
the Lahan area to reclaim
whatever parts of the new
Gear that they can find."

Fei
"Hold on, doc!
Won't the Kislev army
still be in Lahan too!"

Citan
"Most probably.
And in that case, there
will be a conflict between
Aveh's inspection team and
Kislev's pursuit troops.
If they find where we have
hidden Weltall..."

Fei
"The armies will fight over
who gets Weltall...
And right near Lahan too."

Citan
"So, to avoid any problems,
we should move Weltall
somewhere else right away!"

Fei
"But, we can't fix it
in order to move it..."

Citan
"Right.
But staying here will
solve nothing.
Fortunately, this is the
center of all excavation
work in this country.
There is bound to be some
information on where we
can find parts...
Anyway, the fear is often
worse than the danger
itself... We should not let
such fears hold us back!"

Citan
"This is a sand buggy.
...
That is it, Fei!
I have thought of a good
way to get the parts we
need for Weltall.
Let us go back to the
rental shop and rent out
this buggy."

Fei
"What do you intend
on doing, doc?"

Citan
"Well, leave it to me.
Just you wait and see."

———————————————————————————————————

With that truce with
Kislev, the war is
basically over.
Now our job will be to
protect the people
from desert pirates.

Three weeks ago Kislev
raided the ruins to the
north. They're probably
coming here next.
Be careful if you go 
digging at the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

Feels like the war's over.
Now thing's should get
better. I'm so relieved.

This is the Aveh Guard
station.
This town is important
because it's the base for
excavating the ruins.
The elite of our army 
are stationed here.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

All's clear!

No enemies sighted!

Peace...
The war's not over yet
though.
Still, it's like heaven
compared to when we were
always expecting enemy
attacks.

There's a story floating
around that the Kislev army
is looking for buried Gear.
Be careful if you go
digging in the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

Someone named Sigurd is
in charge until the
change to a republic.
...Do you think a
republic is a good
idea?
Anyway, I'm just glad
that an end to the war
is in sight.

The battle with Kislev the
other day in the desert ended
in a complete victory for us.
We need the army because they
get us generators from the
Gears found in the ruins.
We'll never give this town
or our ruins to Kislev.

There are burglars out
looking for treasure
in the desert ruins!
...Brrr...
...Shivers...!
Oh, I just wet my pants.
You better be careful too.

There's a lotta people
who get lost in the desert
and die of starvation!
...Brrr...
...Shivers...!
Oh, I just pooed my pants.
You better be careful too.

Gee, I wanna
climb up there...

 Welcome! 

I counted on the war so I
bought a lot of stuff...
So what happens to my money
when we become a republic?
I'm gonna get wiped out!

Lately there's rumors of
all out war with Kislev.
I'm gonna stock up while
there're still just small
border skirmishes.

Hmm, the prices are a
little high.
But we need these things
to cross the desert...

Shakhan who had been
ruling this country
has been chased out!
The war with Kislev might
end, and life will be easy
again. I'm so happy.

Since those Gebler forces
came, Aveh's hardly ever
lost to Kislev.
I wish the 'Ethos' would
give out some of those
new powerful Gears.

Hmm, you look tired.
You can stay overnight at
the bar, so why don't you
rest there a little bit?
Travelling all worn and
tired, might just get you
killed.

Hey, why the long face?
Something bad happen?
It's times like this,
you need a drink...
or two, or three...

The army's been sending a
lot of guys down here...
But surely, there has to
be a more efficient way
to excavate those ruins!

I'm in a 'fix'...
The generator sensor
is broken...
It's the only thing
that can sense buried
Gear generators...
Without that, I'm
'ruin'ed!

There's a buncha thieves
out in the desert called
Sandmen... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

There's a buncha pirates
in a sand cruiser out in
the desert... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

Taking excavated parts to
the workshop doesn't pay
so well anymore.
I hear they might downsize
the workshop...times are
tough, I tell ya.

Big profits for little work!
That's the best way to make
money... That's the knack!
We make our money selling
the parts we excavate to
the 'Ethos'.
The rarer the parts, the
better the price!
'Dig it'!?

So...
What do you
want to buy?

This is the waterworks.

Since that disaster happened
to the 'Ethos', they've been
running around like fools...
Now, just getting parts is a
tough enough task.

If requests for repairs
keep coming at this pace,
we won't be able to keep up.
We should ask the 'Ethos'
headquarters to expand this
workshop.

I'm selling the parts
in the warehouse now,
but if this keeps up,
they're gonna run out.

We're out of Gear parts
in the warehouse.
I'm gonna have to order
more from the 'Ethos'
headquarters.

I have finished restocking
the parts, now maybe I can
get some rest at last.

I'm gonna have to
cooperate with the
surviving mechanics.

I'll have to ask the
'Ethos' headquarters
to send a mechanic that
can repair army Gears.

The competition is 
all gone. Sigh.

The rest of the country 
has an unusual interest 
in this area's ruins.
Large units have come to 
excavate all the ruins.

Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get

We're Aveh Army Guards!

I've seen the end of the
war with Kislev and the
deposition of that Prime
Minister who grew fat off
of our country.
I'm old but very happy
that I can live out my
days peacefully with my
grandchildren.

The area around this town has
the highest concentration of
ruins on the southern part
of the continent of Ignas.
Aveh and Kislev have been 
fighting over these ruins
forever. I'm old now. I
just want to live in peace.

Oh dear, the water
has stopped again!
The workshop must be
using it right now.

Actually, ever since the
guild came the waterworks
here have gotten better,
but...nobody's perfect...

They always said that
when you get old, you'll
have trouble with your
waterworks...but I didn't
realize they meant this!

Lately Grandpa's been in a
'happi' and 'jelly' mood.

Lately Grandpa's been in

They've all become so nice!

I wonder who built

But after looking at

have my doubts.

Why don't we just leave

Civilian worker Gears have

But even if we had a
military Gear, we wouldn't
be able to operate it...

Shop Owner
Hm? Haven't met you before.
So you want to rent out a
sand buggy too?

Fei
"Sand buggy?"

Citan
"A sand buggy is a special
type of vehicle designed
for the desert terrain.
Its tires will not get
stuck in the sand...
You really need them for
long desert trips."

Shop Owner
Sorry but all our buggies
are lent out now. Do you
want to wait for one?
Some of those guys
hunting for parts should
be back soon.

Citan
"I see...
Well then, we will
come again later."

Shop Owner
Sorry, it's not back yet.
Please wait a little more.

Fei
"You can't pilot
a military Gear?
Why is that, doc?"

Citan
"Military and civilian
Gears are different in
their basic structure.
That is why you need
special training and
natural talent to use
military Gears."

Fei
"What do you mean...'If you
aren't trained, you can't
pilot a military Gear.'?
(Wasn't that Gear we found
a military Gear?
So why could I get it to
work then, doc?)"

is because your natural
talent is so prevalent."

Running into those army
guys is real dangerous...
If they find new ruins,
they'll take them over
for themselves...
So, I wonder where
the best place is?

Shh!
I'm trying to think.
So, keep it down.

Since the army no longer
controls the dig sites,
you can go by yourself...
Now the buying prices at
the 'Ethos' workshop
have gone down.
What should we do?

I came here looking for 
fortune...but all the
good sites are controlled
by the military.
I'll have to go home a
failure. What should I do?

I wanted to try my luck 
at treasure hunting.
I'm pretty successful.
The reason is I found a
good partner.
Even now he's looking at 
a map, analyzing our next
step. I sure depend on my
pal.

its only a little bit.

"Yes. The 'Ethos' workshops
are the only places that
officially repair Gears.
Let us see if we can get
the parts we need to fix
Weltall here.
As they say, time is money!

we can do as soon as we are
able to."

Gear Mechanic
Huh?
How can we help you?

Citan
"Sorry to bother you.
Our Gear has broken down,
so I would like to buy
some parts to fix it."

Gear Mechanic
Tough luck, huh?
Can you tell me what make
of parts you are after?

Citan
"Yes, we are hoping to
replace an X-29 model
injection bypass circuit."

Gear Mechanic
X-29 model injection
circuit?
That's only used on the
latest military models.
We don't keep those kind
of parts in stock here.
You can only get such
special parts by placing
an order at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
This workshop is only
for the repair of
civilian Gears...

Citan 
"I see.
Sorry to have
bothered you."

———————————————————————————————————

These days the 'Ethos'
technology has become
indispensable in people's
day-to-day lives.
We thought we'd use these 
left over facilites and 
try and help everyone as 
much as we can.

You two again?
As you can see, this facility
is for the repair of worker
Gears only.
We simply can't help you out
with the new model military
Gear that you have.

This town was orginally a
haven for treasure hunters
searching the ruins.
Our workshop can hardly keep
up with the demand for repairs
on the worker Gears used in
the excavation of the ruins.

Sorry that we
can't help you.

Please don't touch it.
It's being repaired.

for Weltall."

Fei
"Going to the desert? Doc,
are you going to excavate
some ruins or something?"

Citan
"The Kislev and Aveh armies
are confronting each other 
in the desert all the time.
There is talk that their
forces often break into
battle over the ruins."

Fei
"What does that have
to do with that Gear?"

Citan
"If I search the battle-
fields for the wrecks of
such army Gear...
...I should be able to
find the parts we need.
(Besides Weltall is a
Kislev Gear, so we need
parts from Kislev Gears.)"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"Fei, you are such a
worrier. Things have
a way of working out.
You do not need to worry
so much. Why not go kill
some time at the bar
until I get back."

Fei
"Doc..."

Shop Owner
Hey, are you letting
him go out there alone?
Lots of fights break out
in the desert...it's a
real dangerous place.
I've heard about a group
of pirates riding around
attacking people on a
sand cruiser.
You really shouldn't let
him go out there by
himself.

It's best if you go out
there and try to find
him as soon as you can.

Of course...the keys are 
in the ignition, you can 
take it now.

Please bring the sand
buggy back as soon as
possible. Thank you!

So when will you be
returning the buggy?
