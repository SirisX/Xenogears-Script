Are they Aveh Gears?
...
I'm worried about doc..."

Fei
"Guess I may as well
follow those Gears."

...And now I've lost
sight of those Gears too."

Fei
"What's happening?"

!!

Fei
"W, what the heck
is that thing?"

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"A different unit?
Are they going toward the
direction the saucer went?
I'd better follow them
so as not to lose sight
of them..."

Fei
"Does this desert ever end?
It'll get dark soon, so I
better hurry up and..."

Fei
"What's going on here?
Gears, a flying saucer...
and now these guys...
I hope doc's alright!"

Fei
"...
Eeeyah!"

Aveh Soldier(on motorcycle)
Wa-a-a-a-a!!

Fei
"Errh, sorry about that!
Just let me borrow this
for a while!"

Aveh Soldier
 Hey, wa~it!

Fei
"What's with you guys?
Aren't you overreacting a
little for just stealing
a motorcycle..."

Fei
"Ah...!"

Citan
"Fei! I was looking
everywhere for you."

Fei
"Doc!
You're alright?"

Citan
"Yes, of course..."

!

Citan
"Looks like we do not
have time to chat."

Citan
"Fei, hurry!"

Fei
"Hurry and
do what...?"

Citan
"I cannot use Weltall
very well! Only you can
use its full potential...
Hurry up and get on
board!"

Fei
"...A, a, alright."

Desert Attack! - Grahf enters - 0716
———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"I don't know how...
but I beat them!"

HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!

Fei
"W, what the?"

Man In Black
"Your hot blooded desire
for battle has not been
tamed, I see."

Anime Cutscene - Grahf appears
———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"Who are you!?"
"Who...right, I know you..."
"You killed her..."
"Her?"
"No...it wasn't...not me! 
I...you coward. It was you!"

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"You're the one from...
Lahan...!!"

Citan
"Here we go again..."

Man In Black
"My name is Grahf...
The seeker of power.
You certainly showed how
much power you had back
there in Lahan, didn't
you, Fei!?"

Fei
"How much power I had?
What are you talking
about!"

Grahf
"A greater power...
is what I need to
fulfill my mission.
I sent those Gears into
that land as a catalyst to 
awaken the power in you...
To make contact with you."

Fei
"As a catalyst!?
You mean you caused
that intentionally!?"

Grahf
"That's right.
The death of your loved
ones...
And you powerless against
it happening... The grief,
the screams from your heart
born out of the tragedy...
There!
That was the catalyst for
triggering your power."

Fei
"You mean you attacked my
village just to get me in
that Gear!?
Why!?
Why did the villagers
have to die...?"

Grahf
"Who cares why!
It does not matter how
many of them died...
They were wretched vermin,
only living from day to day
without ever fulfilling
their prescribed destinies!
And have you forgotten?
You were the one who
destroyed the village.
I did not lift a finger."

Fei
"No!!
I was just trying to save
the village and its people!
I never intended to destroy
it!!"

Grahf
"Is that really so?
Surely you have heard it?
It is the very essence of
you...the voice of desire
from within you that
craves destruction."

Fei
"Shut up!
Even if that were
true, aren't you
still the one who
caused it!?
If you hadn't come,
the village wouldn't
have suffered the
way it did!"

Grahf
"Ah, so now you resort
to blame? I see...
That sounds like something
'you' would say.
That's good. Your basic
nature remains unchanged."

Fei
"Crap..."

Fei
"You said you need my
power? What were you
intending to do with it!?"

Grahf
"You know very well...
It is to destroy...
mother god..."

Fei
"D, destroy god?"

Grahf
"Yes, we will destroy god.
That is our purpose...
That is our destiny!"

Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!
I won't get involved
in such a thing!
If you want to destroy
your god, or whatever
it is you're on about...
do it by yourself!!"

Grahf
"Hah, hah, hah...
You resemble your
father."

Fei
"My father?
You mean my dad?
You know my father!?"

Grahf
"That was...
a most delightful scream.
I was enthralled by it.
Nothing is more beautiful
than a scream of death."

Fei
"What did you do to my
father!? What happened
between you two!?"

Grahf
"Hmph, do you really wish
to know? There is no use
in you knowing it now."

Fei
"What!?"

Grahf
"Your power is still
beneath that needed
for my purposes.
Anything unusable
must be tried until
it becomes suitable."

Fei
"What?"

Fei
"!!
What in hell
is that!?"

Grahf
"What will you do, Fei?
If you die here, then
so be it.
You may indeed gain some
happiness from not knowing.
But surely, that is not
what you truly want...?
If you want to know the
truth...and that is what
you want, isn't it Fei...
then this is what to do...
You must show me that you
have attained the level of
strength I require...
To do that you must destroy
others by using your own
strength!
Then you will gain all
that was lost in exchange
for that scream of death!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"

Fei
"W, wait!
We're not finished
talking yet!!"

Citan
"Fei!"

Fei
"...I'm fine...
The Gear seems to be
broken though..."

Citan
"I am so glad that you are
unharmed.
The Gear had only temporary
repairs made on it. They
were not made to survive an
outright battle like that."

Citan
"How are you, Fei?
Did you sleep well?"

Fei
"Huh? 
Ahh...well...
sort of..."

Citan
"Sorry I messed up...
I was careless.
That Gear is a top
secret experimental
model from Kislev...
It was only natural
that Aveh would also
be madly searching
for it."

Citan
"Fei? Are you hurt?
You do not look so well."

Fei
"Well...
I suppose you could
say I was hurt..."

Citan
"That man in black...spoke
of your father's fate...
Is that what is wrong?"

Fei
"There is that
too, but..."

Fei
"It's the other stuff he
said...
What happened at Lahan...
was all planned to get me
to ride in that Gear...
Or so he claimed.
That's got me worried..."

Citan
"To get you to ride
in that Gear...?"

Fei
"Doc, before the village
was destroyed, I lived
without doubting myself.
But it's different now.
I don't...know who I am.
I've never felt like this
before..."

Citan
"Well we cannot do anything
as long as we are prisoners
...even if we wanted to."

Let us rest a little.
Maybe it will sort your
feelings out a little.
     Good idea
     Let's talk more

Citan
"Are you worried
about your father?"

Fei
"All I know is what the
maids at my home in Lahan
told me...
One night a strange masked
man carried me to Lahan.
I was heavily wounded at
the time...
In my delirium I called out
for my father...
That's all they could tell
me about my background.
I don't remember anything
of my father or my past...
So I guess I'm not really
all that lonely or sad..."

Fei
"Doc, why didn't I notice
that I had no memories up
until now?"

Citan
"..."

Let us rest a little.
     Good idea
     Let's talk more

Citan

(It was him! No mistake...
That was no coincidence...)

We are the people expelled

We will probably sink

Doc!!"

Somebody free us!
Argghh!!"

Fei
"Let's get out
of here, doc!"

Citan
"There is a switch for the
sand barrier door on the
right hand side wall there!
But be careful...
Once it is closed it cannot
be opened again."

"We are too late..."

It is no good!
We are done for!

Citan

Hurry!
Go up the crane to

We are going under fast!"

Feels like you have sacked
your saccules, and tickled
your utricles enough for
one life time! Wow, dizzy!"

Fei
"Sorry about that, doc!
I didn't have time to
open up the cockpit...
Are you really okay, doc?"

Citan
"Fei, I was only joking.
Riding in the hand was
not so bad.
I can see what is so
good about this top
secret experimental
Kislev machine."

Fei
"Yeah, when I started it
up, it began doing all
kinds of stuff by itself...
The environmental response
system and weight-reduction
hovering kicked in straight
away...automatically!"

"Really...?
Amazing...!"

Save yourselves but leave
your friends to sink in a

We're not

"Hm. Can't you make
a better plea for
your life?
You come jumping out
of an Aveh ship and
claim that you are
not Aveh soldiers!
Stop trying
to fool me!"

Fei
"I tell you,
it's true!"

Pirate
"Tsk.
How pathetic are you?!
Even if you're the
pettiest of soldiers,
how's about showing 
a little spine...
...and put up a
decent fight!"

Fei
"Stop it! I'm telling
you I'm no soldier!  I
don't want to fight!"

Pirate
"How nauseating!
Why don't you stop
grumbling,
leave the Gear and
run away?"

Pirate
"For someone who doesn't
want to fight, you're
quite powerful...
I see,
an all-environment
model... so that's it,
huh?
Now I want it
even more!"
