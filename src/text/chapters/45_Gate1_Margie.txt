Bart
"No activites for you. (-ERROR-??? spelling activities)
You'll have to settle
down for awhile."

Margie
"What do you mean,
once in awhile?"

Bart
"Don't get so excited.
Ha ha ha ha!"

Margie
"Meanie!"

Pirate
Sigurd!

Sigurd
"...Alright.
Please tell Maison we'll
be here a while longer."

Pirate
Got it!

Sigurd
"We've heard from our
units in Bledavik.
Things are unfolding
smoothly.
They have entered the
castle.
They are investigating
Shakhan's private room
on the top floor of the
castle.
One more thing, Yggdrasil
is on station nearby and
has picked up several
Gears on radar."

Bart
"Shakhan!"

Sigurd
"Most certainly.
But those Gears went to
the capital then turned
and came back toward us."

Fei
"He saw things weren't
looking too good and
ran away."

Bart
"Yeah.
But it sounds like he's
coming back here."

Fei
"What's here...?"

Sigurd
"About that,
the info from the
capital...
Isn't there a -Gate-
in the area?"

Fei
"A -Gate-?"

Citan
"Where?"

Sigurd
"Directly west of Nisan."

Sigurd
"Young master, do you know
the big cave over there?"

Bart
"Cave...
On the western continent?
It's near the ocean.
If I remember it's big
enough for a Gear to walk
into."

Sigurd
"Yes, there.
They found evidence that
there is some large
building inside that cave."

Fei
"Shakhan is heading for
there..."

Fei
"What's he doing?"

Bart
"I guess we'll have
to go and see!"

Fei
"Okay!"

Sigurd
"I'll wait here for
info from the capital."

Citan
"A gate!
Of course I would like to
actually see it...but this
time I will pass.
There are two more left...
And besides...
Just in case things do not
go well, it might be better
if we stay here and protect
Marguerite."

Bart
"Got it.
I leave the rest to you!"

————————————————————————————

Agnes
"Marguerite and
Bartholomew...
I'm so happy to see
you two getting along
so well."

Margie
"Sister, please stop!
You're embarrassing
me again."

Agnes
"It's not embarrassing.
Since long ago, the Nisan
Mother and King of Aveh
have always...

Margie
"Hey!
Enough about this...
Hey...!
Ouch ouch ouch!"

Bart
"Just sit still
like I said."

Margie
"Ohhhhh!
You're a meanie!"

————————————————————————————

Elly
"I want to see the
gate's true shape."

Elly
"Let me come too?"
    Okay
    Sorry!

Citan
"Hmm...
Actually, I would
also like to see it.
May I come along?
I promise not to get
in the way."

Citan
"Exchange with me?"
    Sure
    No way

Rico
"This is Shakhan's last.
When he kick's the bucket
things in Kislev and Aveh
should calm down a little.
Everything'll be normal."

Rico
"I'm coming too, okay?"
    Great!
    Well...

Billy
"The 'Ethos' was
controlling two of
the three gates!"

"Will you take me
along too?"
    Alright!
    Sorry, but...

Maria
"Soon we'll be certain
of the gate's true form."

Maria
"Do you want to change?"
    Please
    That's okay

Chu-Chu
"Chu-Chu is raring chu 
go like a big bonfire!
Fei, I'll protect chu
anywhere, in the heart
of a fire or under the
sea chu!"

Chu-Chu
"So I wanna go chu!"
    I guess it's okay
    Sorry!

first if we'd have stepped
on it?"

Citan
"Could it be a trap?"

"Maybe they're trying to
bait us."

seems pretty fishy to me."

"Could it be a trap?"

suspicious."

Elly
"Hold on!
Isn't this the barrier
generator we heard about
in Shevat!?"

Citan
"Could this be the barrier
generator we heard about
in Shevat!?"

Billy
"Could this possibly be
the machine that makes
the barrier we heard
about in Shevat!?"

Rico
"Hey, isn't this the
machine that generated
the barrier we heard
about in Shevat!?"

Chu-Chu
"Isn't that the whachama-
callit machine the people in
Shevat were talking about!?"

Emeralda
"This...Isn't this the
gate?"

Maria
"Might this be the
barrier generator
Zephyr was talking
about!?"

Bart
"Punk...
Not only was he sitting
on the Aveh throne, he
also controlled this."

Shakhan
"Exactly."

Shakhan
"To think you knew about
the existence of the
gate...very interesting."

Shakhan
"The gate which divided
Solaris from the earth was
under the supervision of...
the 'Ethos'."

Shakhan
"In the beginning, it was
supervised without any true
knowledge of what it did.
However, over the years,
the 'Ethos' did their own
experiments to reveal its
true nature."

Shakhan
"They learned how to use
it."

Shakhan
"For the sake of
freeing ourselves from
Solaris, we discovered
a new way of using it!"

Bart
"You!
This was your original
intention."

Fei
"He probably entered
through this cavern!
He just wanted the energy
from the gate generator!"

Elly
"??
Something's not right."

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Citan
"Something is not quite
right."

Billy
"Don't you think
something's wrong?"

Rico
"What the!?"

Chu-Chu
"Is something wrong?"

Emeralda
"Something... wrong?"

Maria
"???"

————————————————————————————

Shakhan
"This can't be!?
This is ridiculous!?
This thing should be able
to pull an adequate
amount of energy from the
gate!"

Shakhan
"There shouldn't
have been any problems
in the design!
Why?"

Shakhan
"Why doesn't it move?"

Bart
"What, did you mess up?
If my father knew I was set
up by a jerk like this, 
he'd turn in his grave."

Shakhan
"I didn't need this anyway!
I'll take you myself!"

     Do you not desire the power?

Shakhan
"Wha, Who!"

Bart
"Him again!?"

Fei
"How'd he get in
here!?"

Grahf
"I am Grahf, the seeker
of power. Doth
thou desire the power?"

Shakhan
"Power?
What kind of power!?
I have the power of the
gate! As long as I get
this machine to move!!"

Grahf
"Your powers are merely
superficial. The tools
in which you produced
with your immature
intellect... Now, do you
think you can win?"

Shakhan
"What are you saying?
Superficial power?"

Grahf
"The meager efforts of
you land dwellers are
insignificant next to the
true and only power."

Grahf
"I shall endow you with
my true powers!"

Grahf
"My fist is the divine
breath!"

Grahf
"Blossom, o fallen seed,
and draw upon thy hidden
powers!!"

Grahf
"Grant unto thee the
power of the glorious
'Mother of Destruction'!"

12 years ago, if you

"Fei, if anything, I'm
your friend right?"

Bart
"Sig...you won't change 
no matter what I do, 
will you?"

Maison
"What is the matter,
young master...?"

Bart
"Nah...I guess I have to
do what I was asked."

Bart
"My good people of Aveh...
This is Bartholomew Fatima
the 19th king of Aveh,
son of Edbart Fatima IV
the 18th king of Aveh.
First, one must apologize
for the trouble caused by
one's unavoidably lengthy
absence from the palace.
One especially wants to
give one's condolences to
those who lost family in
the war with Kislev.
One will immediately call a
truce with Kislev and begin
reparations to victims of
both countries.
All citizens drafted as
soldiers will also be
allowed to return home.
Let us work together
towards the rebuilding
of Aveh!"

Bart
"...One also has
another final but
important message...
A declaration from the
will of Edbart IV who
wished only for peace
for his kingdom, Aveh.
I Bartholomew Fatima, 
the 19th King of Aveh,
do hearby declare...
from this day forward
I shall abandon the
monarchy and create
the Republic of Aveh!"

Sigurd

Sigurd
"Young master..."

Maison
"What in Aveh 
are you doing...?"

Bart
"This is my father's wish.
I am sorry. You both have
worked so hard for many
long years to restore me
to the throne.
Now I'm no longer in line to
be king, nor anything else
for that matter, the two of
you are free to go."

Maison
"What are you saying...?"

Sigurd
"Unbelievable."

Maison
"Master Sigurd?"

Sigurd
"Can't you hear the 
crowd outside?
They have chosen you as
their king. You're going
to be very busy."

Bart
"Sig..."

Sigurd
"Won't you need some
capable assistance?"

Bart
"Well...here goes 
nothing."

"Oh, young master!
You still haven't
rested yet?" 

Bart
"Old Maison, there is
one thing I want to
ask you."

Maison
"What is it?"

Bart
"Where was Sigurd born?"

Maison
"Young master, that..."

Bart
"He has blue eyes...
it's the Fatima Jasper."

Maison
"...Well...
It was long ago.
When his Majesty and
I were still young...
Long before his Majesty
knew my young master's
mother.
His Majesty was in love
with a certain girl
from a small religious
sect east of Aveh.
This sect was quite
different from Nisan and
the 'Ethos' but she was
very beautiful.
Then...
she just disappeared.
Later there were rumors
of her having a child."

Bart
"She disappeared?
Did father abandon her?"

Maison
"As far as I know, it was
the opposite. His Majesty
was abandoned."

Bart
"Sig is from Aveh's
eastern desert..."

Maison
"Indeed. When he was 10, he
was assigned to his Majesty
King Edbart, as a squire."

"Young master...?"

Bart
"Yeah, I can't sleep."

Sigurd
"Yes, so much has 
happened at once."

Bart
"Hey Sig...what was
your mother like?"

Sigurd
"...She died when I was
but a child,  why?"

Bart
"Do you have any 
memories of her?
What kind of person
was she?"

Sigurd
"Hmmm, well... 
she was very kind...
but when I was born it
seems the doctor told 
her she did not have
long to live.
She lived in constant
fear of that.
As a result, even if she
met someone she liked,
her fear of death was
her drawback.
She worried that she
could not be with me
to the very end..."

Bart
"What about your father?"

Sigurd
"He isn't supposed to
know that I was born.
However, even for not
knowing he still
treated me like a son."

Bart
"Why didn't you tell
him you were his son?"

Sigurd
"If my mother hid that
fact, there had to be
a reason."

Bart
"There is more to my
father's will than what
I declared today.
I must share my
inheritance with
my brother.
He also said...
'You must split you
and your brother's
share with the people.'"

Sigurd
!

Bart
"That had always bugged
me up until now. I didn't
know what he meant.
That's all I wanted to
say...
Good night!"
