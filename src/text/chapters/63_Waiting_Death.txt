Waiting Death - Fei in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

I was powerless...
 
All I could do was stand
by and watch as they took
Elly away from me...
 
I...am powerless...

————————————————————————————

Wiseman
"What are you
doing there?"

Fei
"Oh, it's you...
I...I wasn't able to beat
Grahf...
I didn't stand a chance
against him...
It was obvious from the
start."

Fei
"It was impossible to try
to defeat a monster machine
like that to begin with...
And...Elly...
Why was she so damn
foolish...?"

Fei
"I implicitly told her
not to come...
I told her to run away...
She had to have known it
was a trap."

Wiseman
"...Hmm..."

Wiseman
"Yes, you won't be able to
defeat him like that...
As long as you continue
fighting with that kind
of an attitude, that is."

Fei
"...?"

Wiseman
"The reason you lost and
that young lady was taken
was because of your pride.
Weren't you depending far
too much on the power of
your machine?
...Not to mention that new
'Id Power' you're now able
to control!
What is Grahf's source of
power? His machine? His
technique? His experience?
I do not think so...
It is his feelings.
His heart, his feelings,
are dominated by his
resentment and his hatred
of this world.
That hatred is his source
of power. Your feelings
weren't focused enough to
fight off Grahf.
That is why you could not
win. Your feelings must be
in the right place.
That is strength."

Wiseman
"I'm not surprised
you lost...
...seeing as you do
not understand the
true meaning of
strength..."

Fei
"Wiseman..."

Wiseman
"That young lady...
The only thing in her heart
was her desire to save you
all. She set aside her fear
and piloted that machine."

Wiseman
"It was because she had
such strong feelings that
you are all still alive...
That is what I think.
Of course you have been
defeated. However, that
doesn't mean it's over."

Wiseman
"How do you plan
on responding to
her feelings?
It is now your
turn to save her
...is it not?"

Fei
"..."

Wiseman
"Well, what are
you going to do?
...Fei..."

Fei
"I, errh...
I'm going to..."

————————————————————————————

In order to save Elly,
We began to search
desperately for her
whereabouts...
 
And two weeks later,
we found her.
Using the data obtained
from Razael and his own
nanomachine technology,
Krelian had begun the
construction of god's ark,
'Merkava'.
Its completion was imminent.
 
To prevent its activation,
and to rescue Elly...
we headed for Merkava!

————————————————————————————

Fei
"You again...?
Are you girls thinking
of going in there too?"

Dominia
"Don't get any wrong
ideas there. We are here
to help our Commander.
Miang and Krelian have been
manipulating his emotions
for the sole purpose of
eliminating the Emperor.
We simply want to free the
commander from those bonds
so that he may be saved!
It's neither for the sake
of the world...
nor for the sake of your
girlfriend, Elhaym!"

Dominia
"We have no intentions of
fighting on the same side
as you!"

Fei
"...Fine.
You have your own
battles to fight,
and we have ours...
Let's leave it at that."

Fei
"But...if things get out
of hand, you head back.
We'll handle it."

Dominia
"Hmph...
We'll make you eat those
words... You wait and see!"

————————————————————————————

We entered inside of Merkava
and, while fighting back
units of weapons that self-
regenerated through the use
of nanomachines, we headed
for the central core...
 
And then...
 
once again, (*-ERROR-???*)
Ramsus appeared before us.

Merkava Core - 2026

I've been waiting
for you, Fei!!

Fei
"Ramsus!?"

Ramsus
"Fei...
If only you hadn't
have been born..."

"I...
I...
We're going to
settle this now!!"

Fei
"Stop it, Ramsus!
What reason is there to
continue fighting me!?
Who are you fighting for!?
Why do you always have a
bone to pick with me!?
Tell me why!"

Ramsus
"It is all because of
you...
If only you hadn't come
in and destroyed my
prospects in life..."

My life...was given to
me within a Nanoreactor
in Krelian's laboratory. 
To be born as the superior
being, above all humans...
But then...

————————————————————————————
Krelian's Underground Lab - 1952
————————————————————————————

Krelian
"Hmm...
'This time' your
body is young."

"...The previous
one got too old."

Krelian
"...And the name?"

"Karen...
but individual names
have no meaning to me."

Krelian
"So...
what brings
you here?"

Karen
"Is that thing inside
the Nanoreactor there
...the one?"

Krelian
"Huh? Oh...
Recogniton code
0808191 - 'Ramses'. (*???spelling Ramsus?*)
The Emperor's been told
it's a prototype for an
artificial 'Contact'."

Karen
"What's its status?"

Krelian
"It has entered the so-
called first growth stage.
From now until the binding,
its growth will be several
times faster than that of
an ordinary human.
But its psychological
development will be a
little difficult to
control..."

Krelian
"It is a replica...
so that is to be expected."

Karen
"It is moving...
Can it hear us?"

Krelian
"Yes...
It already has a
will of its own."

Karen
"Then...
I have a better way...
Let us dispose of it."

Karen
"We do not need this...
We have my child. My child
will be 4 this year."

Krelian
"Your having
a child is...
significant?"

Karen
"Yes...
I checked it out...
There is no mistake,
it's a 'Contact'."

Krelian
"What's its name?"

Karen
"My child's name
is...
'Fei'.
So...
you understand
what this means?"

Krelian
"A corresponding
'Antitype' is..."

Karen
"Yes...
probably already
born somewhere."

Karen
"...The final one!"

Krelian
"Then...
this thing is...
worthless."

Karen
"Yes, totally useless."

Karen
"Ha-ha...
Chase after it, 'boy'.
A love that's unattainable
for you, no matter how hard
you try to pursue it."

Until then...

Ramsus
"Because of your existence,
I was discarded...!
I was destined to be the
representative of god...
having the might of the
Emperor.
I was destined to be the
ultimate existence, having
the power to exercise
absolute control over all!
But...
I lost it all...
because of you!!"

Fei
"M, my mother...?
How...do you know her...?
Ramsus...!"

Dominia
"Commander!
Please stop this!
Commander, if what you
say is true, then that
is even more of a reason
not to fight!
You were just used by
Krelian and..."

Ramsus
"Silence!!
You...even you...
dare to censure me!?
I saved you from nearly
becoming a test subject
and now you turn on me!?"

Dominia
"You are mistaken!
We are only thinking of
your best interests..."

Ramsus
"Silence!!
Ultimately, only
I can help myself!
I am the only one that
can correct this!"

Ramsus
"This is the end for you!!
En garde!
Cause, here I come, Fei!!"

Krelian
"I would have liked to
have been able to commend
you for making it here...
But your efforts were all
in vain.
The resurrection of -Deus-
is imminent.
Sacrificing this girl will
bring about the awakening
of 'god'."

Fei
"What are you talking
about!? Why does Elly
have to be sacrificed!?"

Krelian
"There's no need for you
to know. For all of you,
it will all end here..."

"Heh... Well then...,
let's start over from
the beginning again.
You think you can
beat me this time?"

Fei
"What the...!?
I thought I
defeated you...!?"

Krelian
"Unless you can
decompose her atomic
structure,
you don't stand much
of a chance.
Normal attacks are
futile against one who
has the ability to
regenerate
using nanomachines."

Miang
"Now, the time has come
for the great awakening!"

Citan
"It is our...
Omnigears!?"

Fei
"Damn,
what's going on!?
Huh!?
Hey...
Is that...!?"

Fei
"Our Omni...?
No, that's not it!!
Is that...
our Anima Relics!?"

Citan
"Is it trying to detach
the Anima Relics from
our Omnigears!?"

Fei
"Deus is...
swallowing up our
Anima Relics!?"

Citan
"...
It seems the Anima Relics
have fallen into the hands
of the enemy."

Miang
"This is the true meaning
of the -Anima Relics-...
To attain their respective
-Animus- and return to the
-Persona-.
The Anima Relics are really
one set of parts that make
up -Deus-, the physical
manifestation of god.
They regain their original
powers or functions by
aligning themselves with
their destined partner...
An Omnigear that has lost
its respective Anima Relic,
is but a puppet.
It becomes a mere vessel
or container in which there
are no contents."

Krelian
"And this girl too was
destined to become one
with god...
You see...Elyhaym is
really one of the parts
of god as well..."

Fei
"What the hell are
you talking about!?"

Krelian
"Put simply, you served to
help bring all the parts of
god together, here, for me.
You're a bunch of stupid
fools. It's as if you're
all clowns..."

Miang
"You believed the legend
of how our world and the
universe was created...
But the Ministry and I
fabricated that very myth
a long time ago to suit
our purposes."

Fei
"That's a lie!!
How can that be true...?"

Miang
"I think you'll find that
your friends' Omnigears
are all dead too...
I'm talking about your
friends who split up and
took a different path than
you into this place...
They were all parts of god
that were disassembled in
the past, but once again,
are all gathered here."

Krelian
"Yes.
It is indeed the time for
the resurrection of god."

W, what was it all for...
Everything that I have
done up until now...
