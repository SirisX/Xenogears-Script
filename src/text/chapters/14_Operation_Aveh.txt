Maison
"We must infiltrate Aveh 
and rescue Margie now!
Gebler has discovered this
base. So we should leave a
small garrison and evacuate
while we still can.
Fortunately, the Yggdrasil
is undamaged, so we are
able to embark immediately.
The crew's preparations are
complete.
Whenever you are ready,
Master Fei and good Doctor,
please accompany the young
master to the bridge."

Maison
"Doctor Uzuki, Master Fei, 
I thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
I would truly appreciate it
if you would be so kind as
to stay with us and help us
out on our rescue mission!"

Bart
"Hey, alright, alright.
Let me say goodbye to
the women before we go."

Sigurd
"It's time to sneak
into Aveh at last.
First of all, our party
should inspect the town
and work out a plan of
action."

Sigurd
"Currently anchored
at our hideout..."
    Leave the hideout.
    Changed my mind.

Ramsus
"Hmph, what a
dismal welcome."

We're on the 'surface'."

"Yes, sir."

Shakhan
"Well, well, Commander.
You've only just taken
command and already you
are achieving splendid
results.
You dispatched those
irksome Kislev units
in a matter of days...
I'm very impressed."

Ramsus
"I can't believe you
were beaten by such
a small force...
I have only just
taken over my post
and already you have
embarrassed me!"

Vanderkaum
"I am sorry Commander.
They were more persistent
than we anticipated.
They had a new model Gear
that was very mobile.
I couldn't get a lock on
it with the main gun...
Otherwise there would have
been no way we could have
been beaten by such..."

Ramsus
"Fool!
Know when to use that
big gun, and on whom!
You failed because you
try to solve everything
with force.
You have muscles instead
of brains."

Vanderkaum
"Commander!!"

Ramsus
"Dismissed.
Go polish your beloved
1200 sem cannon."

Shakhan
"Tomorrow is the 500th
anniversary of this
country.
Please come to the
dedication ceremony."

Shakhan
"There is a customary
Tournament after the
dedication ceremony..."

Ramsus
"What about the incident
in that report?"

Shakhan
"What? Oh, you mean the
500-year-old mobile weapon
excavated from the ruins?
Thanks to the help of the
'Ethos', the repairs are
complete.
I thought we could announce
it on the day of the
dedication ceremony..."

Ramsus
"Toys like that should
be given to Vanderkaum.
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'."

Shakhan
"I already have obtained
one half of the crest.
But I haven't been able
to get her to tell me
where the other half is.
She is a rather strong-
willed girl..."

Ramsus
"You're not being rough
with her, are you?"

Shakhan
"Of course not. I know
how you despise vulgar
acts like that."

Ramsus
"You said that girl is the
Holy Mother of Nisan...
Is she upstairs?"

Shakhan
"Yes, in the
east tower."

Ramsus
"Miang, could
it possibly be
a 'Relic'?"

Miang
"Yes. But there is still no
response. There seems to be
a barrier or something.
However, we do know from
the 500-year-old records
that one certainly exists
in this vicinity.
It's probably well
preserved too."

Ramsus
"...Let's meet her.
I want to talk to her
directly. Miang, you
come with me."

Miang
"Yes sir."

Ramsus
"I am Ramsus, she is
Miang. We would like to
ask you some questions."

Margie
"I'm Margie.
Actually it's Marguerite.
What do you want to know?
My favorite food? I like
cake, Chiffon Nisan is my
favorite. I haven't had
it in so long..."

Ramsus
"Marguerite, we want to
ask you about the Fatima
family treasure...
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'. You see,
I'm keeping the piece
you had in a safe place.
But I don't know where
the other piece is.
Do you?"

Margie
"Nope.
The one I had you took
from me.
You didn't even give
me anything for it.
Hey, the next time you
come, could you bring
some Chiffon Nisan?
I used to eat it
everyday in Nisan.
I don't think they
make it in Aveh.
Aveh used to have such
good bakers, but I
guess they must have
all died in the war."

Ramsus
"That is too bad.
I don't know much about
cake, but I'll see if I
can find some for you
next time."

Margie
"Thank you Ramsus.
I'll be waiting."

Ramsus
"Is there anything else
you need?
If there's something you
want I'll bring it next
time."

Margie
"No. I just want to go
back to Nisan. They must
be so worried about me."

Ramsus
"I'm sorry but please
wait a little longer.
We want you to stay
here until we find
the other half of the
'Fatima Jasper'."

Shakhan
"I'm amazed she talked
that much. He can handle
women as well as he says."

Minister
Is it all right?

Shakhan
"I can't prevent them from
meeting her. Not when it's
him we are talking about...
Besides, Marguerite isn't
talking anyway.
So there is no need to
worry...
But where did the leak
about the Jasper come
from...?
...The 'Ethos'?
Ridiculous...! Hmmm,
if this continues my
plans will be..."

Shakhan
"We had better find out
who is leaking out our
information immediately.
In the meantime, we'll
have to administer some
truth serum to our
guest, Miss Marguerite.
We must find the other
piece of the 'Fatima
Jasper' as quickly as
we can."

Minister
But...

Shakhan
"However spineless the last
commander, Vanderkaum,
was...
...this time Gebler has
sent their highest
commanding officer.
His country is throwing all
their weight into this.
And, there is nothing we
can do about it!"

Woman
Welcome to Bledavik!
We're having a festival
celebrating the founding
of our country, Aveh.
There's a martial arts
tournament too.
It's been a while since
we have had so many
visitors.

Do you already have a hotel?
    Yes
    Not yet

Really? Too bad. 
I know a good place.

————————————————————————————

You'd better get a room
soon or they'll all be 
gone.
I know a good hotel.

That one.

Tell them my name at
the front desk and
they'll give you a deal.

Sister of Nisan
!

Ah...
Excuse me but...aren't 
you Prince Bartholomew?

Bart
"...And you are?"

Sister
I was sent here by
the Nisan Sect.  
I'm here to check up
on Mother Marguerite.
Prince Bartholomew,
I knew you would come
sooner or later...

Citan
"Well, let us not just
stand here chatting. 
Shall we use a room?"

You must be tired. 
I'll be in my room, 
please come by later.

That's my room there.

————————————————————————————

Sister
Excuse me but
who are they...

Bart
"Oh, this is Fei and
Citan. They're going to
help rescue Margie."

Sister
Thank you for coming here
in this desert heat.
I am a servant of the
Nisan Sect.
Ever since Shakhan took
Mother Marguerite I've
been looking into ways
to get her back.
I've been trying to find
out where she is being
held.
I've been busy listening
to workers talk about
the comings and goings
from the castle...
And giving food to the
guards who are preparing
for the Tournament to
loosen their lips too.
Finally yesterday, I got
some information...
Margie's in the citadel.
The problem is how to 
slip into the castle...
I thought about it a lot
but it looks pretty bleak.
I'm sorry.

Bart
"No big deal. At least
we know where she is now.
You just relax, we'll
find a way to slip into
the castle."

Sister
My apologies. If there
is anything else I can do
to help just ask...
Do you have any good leads?

Bart
"Not yet. We're gonna
hit the streets for
info. now.
Then we'll think
about the rest later."

Sister
I see. I'm very relieved
that you are all here.
Please come see me again
if you hear anything new.

I came from far away when
I heard about this festival.
But this town is so uptight!
Everyone looks at outsiders
like me so suspiciously!
It was getting to me, so I
shut myself up in my hotel
room.
But, now this tiny room is 
starting to get to me too.

Customer
Oh no, you raised
the prices again...

Hey, give me a deal.

Vendor
I'm sorry. The army just
comes and confiscates
whatever it wants. So I'm
a little short of stock.

I hope this war
ends soon.

Lady Vendor
Radishes! Get 'em here!
Get your spicy radishes!
Big Lahan radishes! 

Wanna buy a radish?
They're from Lahan, the
hottest you can find.
You'll be spitting fire.
Try one.

10G for one.
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Alright.
How about 9G?
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Just try one.
8G?
    Buy one
    Don't buy any 

Hey, you can't carry anymore!
Don't play tricks on old
people like that.

Thanks.

Hey!
Don't burn yourself 
breathing fire.

Weren't you going to
buy one? They say people
who play tricks on the
old will shrivel up and
die in the desert.

You don't like spicy
things?
Too bad.

Old Man
Huh!?

Hmm, 
Who was that?
I forgot...

Oh yeah!
I remember! 

Prince Bartholomew?
    Yes!
    Don't know him!

Bart
"Hey, that's pretty
good, grandpa!"

Old Man
My, how you've grown...
Your Highness probably 
doesn't remember me, but
I used to work in the
castle kitchen.
You would always come
in and taste everything.
You used to dress up and
say, 'I'm a pirate! Give
me your food!'...
Ah, the good old days...

Life's been hard since
the old king died.
Not that an old man like
me has much longer to
worry about that...
But my children and grand-
children are still young.
I wonder if it'll ever get
any better?

————————————————————————————

Old Man
Hmm...
must be someone else...
When you get older your
memory really goes.

————————————————————————————

Shop Owner
Are you all here for the Tournament?
    Yes
    Huh?

Yeah, well I'm glad. The
war's gotten worse, and
there are fewer tourists.
Well, have fun.

What, you don't know?
It's only the biggest
martial arts tournament
in the world!
I came all the way to
Bledavik just to see it.
You'll be sorry if you
don't go.

————————————————————————————

Grandma
Whew, keeping up with my
granddaughter is tough.

Granddaughter
Grandma, hurry, hurry!
Finish shopping so we
can go to the festival.

Little Girl
Get off my back!
I'm just looking!

Shut up! 
Mind your own business!

!

Kid
(Hurry!) 

Shopkeeper
Hey, you!

Show me what you're 
hiding! 
Give it back now and I 
won't tell your folks.

Little Girl
What are you talking
about lady? I'm not
hiding anything! Do you
wanna see?

See.

Shopkeeper
That's strange...

Little Girl
You can't accuse people
without proof!
C'mon lady!

————————————————————————————

Little Boy
We're playing hide-and-
seek. You wanna play?
    Play
    No thanks
	
Afraid you'll lose, heh?

————————————————————————————
	
When you leave I'll
hide, then you gotta 
find me.

When you leave I'll 
hide somewhere.

Good job.
Next time I'll hide 
somewhere better.

I didn't think you'd ever
find me here. You're good.
You musta been the champ
when you were a kid.
But you won't find me
next time.

A~w-ge~e!
You found me here, too?
OK, time for my secret
weapon! You'll never
find me there!!

GE~EZ!
How'd you find me?
Forget it!
I'm quitting
hide-and-seek.
Here's my badge.
I don't need it
anymore.

 Received H&S Badge

Little Girl 2
Hey! Hey, man!
Will you feed us?
    Sure
    Well...

Then lend me 1000G
    Sure
    No way

!! 

Wow, thanks...
You're really
nice man...
I mean 'mister'.

Hey, if you don't have 
any money don't fool 
people like that.

!!

Little Girl 1
Thanks for loaning me 
money. I'll stop stealing. 
The two of us will work
hard till dad comes back.

Little Girl 3
I promise I'll return it
when my dad comes back.

Ever since my oldest son
was drafted, I've been
so lonely.
My younger son is up on
the roof looking north.
Ahh... I hope my boy
comes home safely...
He's such a gentle child,
I'm worried how he'll
make it in the army.
He used to arrange the
flower upstairs.
But now I make them as
I pray for his safety.

————————————————————————————
-AFTER- ???
My oldest son came back!
My prayers were answered.
Now I'm putting all my
effort into cooking.

My brother has gone
off to fight...

To the north, by the
border.
I pray everyday that
he will return home 
safe...

...And that he'll beat up
lots of Kislev guys too!

When I get older I wanna
be a Gear pilot and shoot
Kislev guys too.
If we don't they'll take
over and kill or make
slaves of everyone.

Right (??? missing question mark)
    Yep
    Not really

I'm gonna be a 
strong soldier!

Those Kislev guys 
are real bad!
And...they killed
my dad.
I hafta get 'em.

Fish are pretty. I

    You said it!
    I'd like to eat!

I thought I'd go to the
sea after the war. 
I don't mean the sea of
sand either.
Just water, spreading on
forever like a desert...
A sea of water full of
pretty fish.

Customer 1
Even my good-for-
nothin' kid gives me
less to worry about than
this wacky world...

Customer 2
All the young men in
town have been drafted.
They wouldn't take me
because I'm an alcoholic.

Soldier 1
Hey!
Who d'ya think made it
so ya can enjoy this
festival in peace?
Soldiers! It's 'cause
we're out there risking
our lives. Did ya know
that?

Barkeep
I'm sorry, all his 
friends were killed in
the battle at the ruins.
He's a little wild.
Forgive him.

Soldier 2
We're fighting to the end.
This isn't for peace or
justice or for the government,
it's for my fallen comrades.

Man 1
...That makes 5 mining 
Gears and 10 miners.

And make it quick!
I need some miners
without families.

Well... When guys with
families get killed on
a dangerous job, I have
to pay compensation to
the families.
It's a real pain.

So that's it. 
If you find some tell me.
I'm counting on you.

Man 2
Since the war started
you can really tell who
is stupid and isn't.
The stupid ones have
been forced out of
business.
But if you change your
view, war can be good
business.
When there aren't enough
people or goods, you can
sell at a higher price.

Why would I do that?
With that old creep?
I'd never be used as
a tool for that old

Girl
My brother is such a 
child, always playing
hide-and-seek.
What a laugh. I wonder 
where he's hiding now?

————————————————————————————

My brother says he's
over playing hide-and-
seek. But now he has
nothing to do.
He's probably just
wandering around the
area. He's still such
a child.

That kid is amazing. 
Since her father has 
been away she's been 
running the store all
by herself.

My dad came back. 
I was helping him in the
store but he told me to
go play somewhere.

I must apologize.
There are so many cats
here it's hard to walk.
My daughter collects them.

Daughter
I'm back.

Mother
Hi...
Hey, come here!

Daughter
Wh, what? 
I'm not hiding anything.

Mother
Just come here...

Daughter
I did...
can I go upstairs now?

Mother
!

That child...
what did she bring home now?

Daughter
But...it's so sad. 
I have no father, but at
least I have a mother. This
kitty has neither parent...
I feel lonely cause my
dad's not here. But just
think how my poor little
kitty friend feels.
So...I told her that she'll
have lots of friends at my
house...and she just
followed me home...

Mother
... Recently they 
started calling my 
house the cathouse.

Daughter
Sorry.

Mother
You're gonna have to 
take care of it.

Daughter
Okay.

————————————————————————————

Yep, we're full of cats.

Cats are so cute. When
I pet them, I get sleepy.

Little Boy
I wonder...
where's he hiding?

Old Woman
I've been doing laundry
here for 60 years...
The water is the only
thing that hasn't changed.
There's a spring flowing
beneath the castle.
I was worried that when
the king died, the water
would stop too, but it 
didn't.
That old guy down there
in charge of the water
won't budge an inch even
for Shakhan.

Yeah!
He's great guy!
My childhood friend.

Old Man
It's cool here. 
Cool air blows up 
from the grate.

No good, no good.
You won't open it 
without the key!
Many years ago a kid 
got lost down there.
I think it was the kid 
from the armor store...

My son's fighting for
the country. He won't be
back soon...
It must be a tough job.
Yep, I'll bet he's a
general by now.

Old Woman
Sorry, he's gone a little
senile... You see, our son
'went on holidays' to get
out of joining the army.
But we haven't heard from
him in 10 years...

Kid
Ah, you found me.

You found me here too.
Next time's for real.

Huh? You wanna hear about
when I went down the well?
It's been a while since
anyone asked me about that.
Everyone wanted to know
about it back then...
Well...cough...I was
still a kid when I hid
in there. Actually I got
lost...pretty embarrassing!
At first, I thought I could
follow the current out, but
the grill stopped me.
So I swam against the
current.
The speed of the current
is always changing so if
your timing's off it's
really tough.
I hear it's the opening
and closing of the flood
gate that changes the
speed of the current.
But if you keep going
against the current you'll
end up right under the
castle.
I was scared stiff by the
manager guy there...
The lid to the well's
been locked since then.
It was a great place to
hide but it's no place
for amateurs.

Huh? The key?
The old guy who is always
sitting on the bench by
the east well has it.

Old Man
The well key?
I've got it.
I'm in charge of the
waterworks association.

What are you gonna do with the key?
    Search underground
    Rescue Margie
    Steal from the castle

Stupid!
You'll just get lost!

What!?
You wanna clash
with Shakhan?

Hah!
This is great!
This is great!
I like you guys.
I'll lend you the key.
You get that Shakhan
for me!

Received Well Key!

————————————————————————————

Old Man
You big fools!!
You kids are thinking of
playing around and living the
easy life while other kids are
out there spilling their blood
on the battlefield!
Shame on you! Shame!
You don't deserve to live here.
This whole town is rotting
away...
Damn! Damn that Shakhan!

Bart
"Don't get mad, gramps.
It's a joke. A joke.
Look at me. Do I look
like a thief to you?"

Old Man
I don't get it ...
...............
Oh?...Oh!...You...
No, it couldn't be!

Bart
"Gramps, are you senile?
It's true. It is me!"

Old Man
Prince Bartholomew?
I though you had died in (??? spelling error)
that accident. 
You're still alive...

Bart
"Still alive and I'm gonna
save my cousin being held
in the castle.
That's why I gotta sneak
in through waterways. So
help me out here gramps."

Old Man
Of course!

Received Well Key!

Bart
"Thanks.
I appreciate it!"

Old Man
Sorry about what I 
said before...

Bart
"Don't worry about it.
I'm glad there are people 
like you worried about 
the country."

Son
Hey daddy, buy me
one of those toys.

Dad
No, nope.
Wait till the Tournament
is over. I'll buy you
something better then.

Son
I want the toys in 
that store...
I wanna play army.

Man
Hey, have you ever
seen a flying saucer?
    Yep
    Nope
	
Yes, that is the country of
the great ancients.
They came from a star farther
than heaven and created us.
They ruled this land as gods.
But, man gained knowledge and
strife erupted everywhere.
The ruins are proof of those
struggles. The descendants of
the gods fled this land of
conflict making their place
in the sky.
It was a peaceful place, with
a civilization far more
advanced than ours.
...Are you listening?
They are still alive.
Have you noticed that
sometimes people disappear?
They're taken by what I call
Sky People.
They are trained as soldiers
to rule over the earth again.
The time is near.
God's army will appear out of
nowhere. Haven't you heard?
Don't defy them, you can't
win.
They will make a paradise
on earth again. 
That's what my research
has shown about the Sky
People and the saucer.
	
————————————————————————————

Hey, have you ever
seen a flying saucer?
    Yes I have
    I've ridden on it too
	
————————————————————————————

...The gods fell from
the sky, lost their
memory and created
everything anew...

...People of that
country feared war on
earth and fled to the sky.

...Giants driven from
the heavens brought fire
on the earth...

...That's because you
live looking down.
...Pitiful.
The day of judgement
is near you know!?

————————————————————————————

Woman
Hey, you're not from around here.
How do you like Bledavik?
    I like it
    Don't like it

Well, great.
Enjoy the festival.

————————————————————————————

Woman
Oh...
That's because the war's
put everyone on edge.
Bledavik's a really nice
place in peace time.

————————————————————————————

Little Boy
I'm going to see the
Tournament. Fighting
is a man's game.

Lady
Be careful. There are 
lots of strange shops at 
the festival.

Old Man 1
...hic...
It's been a while since
I last drank outside.

Old Man 2
Hic!
Drinkin' Bartweiser
in broad daylight...
Thash my favorite
part of feshtivals!

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Fei!"

Bart
"The castle's up ahead.
If I go, it'll cause 
problems.
If you're going to go,
the two of you should
go by yourselves.
I'll wait here."

Citan
"Fei, what shall we do?"
    Let the two of us go.
    Go to the castle later.
	
Bart
"Okay, be careful."

Man
Yo, dude!
Try and pick the champion?

Citan
"The champion of what?"

Man
Huh?
The champion of
the 'Tournament'!

Citan
"Do they bet on
this 'Tournament'?"

Man
What
What are you talking about?
Tournaments ARE gambling!
Why do you think people
even come here? To bet on
who will be champion! Duh!

Citan
"Excuse us, we have only
just arrived and know
nothing of the Tournament."

Man
Oh, tourists, huh?
Well let me tell you about
the Tournament.
Every year they hold a big
martial arts tournament 
here in Aveh.
Fighters from all over the
world gather to see who's
strongest. It's like a big
brawl.
Everyone goes wild over
guessing who'll win. So,
wanna give it a try?

Citan
"Betting on the Tournament
...Is that allowed at such
a grand event"

Man
You bet. The soldiers
are crazy about it. If
Kislev attacked tomorrow
Aveh would be dust.
What are you gonna do?
Registration's not over
yet, but all the strong
ones have signed up.
The rest are only after
the consolation prizes
anyway...

Citan
"Let us wait and see.
Some strong ones might
still register."

Man
Ha!
What a buncha cowards.

Citan
"Fei, we can use this
to our advantage!
If you create a stir at
the Tournament, the guards
will be watching you
rather than their posts.
It will make it easy for
us to sneak into the
castle and rescue Margie.
What do you think, Fei?
Will you enter the 
Tournament?"

Fei
"Who...me?"

Citan
"While you draw the guards'
attention the young one can
sneak into the castle.
Surely you see that it is
the only way we will get
in? Right...
Let us go sign you up."

Citan
"And Fei, do not use
your real name, make
another suitable one."

————————————————————————————

Little Boy
My cousin's friend
is gonna fight in it.
Pretty cool, huh!

Man 2
To enter...
Or not to enter...
That is the question...

Woman
This is the best place
to see the action for free.
I'm saving my space now!

Vendor
Shoot, can't get any
decent customers today.

Old Man
I'm ready already...
What's taking so long?

Guard 1
You can't go in here.
This will be spectator 
seating tomorrow.

Guard 2
If my guy wins...
I'm going to the bar and
order the most expensive
whiskey they have.
Then I'm gonna ask that
waitress out! I wonder what
to get her for a present.

Guard 3
This is the Tournament
Registration Booth.
    Enter the Tournament
    No thanks
	
You're the Dragon 
Slaying Boxer, right?

You are signed up.
The Tournament begins
tomorrow. Please make
sure you are here.

Bart
"Well, let's go."

————————————————————————————
Bledavik - Hotel Room - 0816
————————————————————————————

Sister of Nisan
Any new information?
Good ideas?

Bart
"I just remembered where
Bledavik's water supply
comes from...
Spring water rises up from
under the castle and flows
to the town via a series
of underground waterways.
We can sneak into the
castle by going through
these underground
waterways.
We can get into them from
the town's well. The water-
ways should lead right up
to the castle's reservoir.
If we are able to get that
far, we should be able to
sneak into the other rooms
of the castle from there."

Citan
"A good idea, except I
have one more suggestion.
There is a festival going
on now. There must be a
way we can use it to our
advantage."

————————————————————————————

Sister
Did you find a way 
to use the festival?

Citan
"Tomorrow is the 
Tournament. There will
be betting at the arena.
Surely, the soldiers'
minds will be more on the
Tournament than their job.
We must use this to our
advantage."

Sister
What do you mean?

Citan
"Fei will participate.
We will have him put
on a big show there."

Sister
I'm sure today's the
last day to sign up for
the Tournament. You'd
better register soon.

————————————————————————————

Sister
North of town is a
plaza. The castle is
beyond that.
I'm sure we'll find
something there.

————————————————————————————

Citan
"No need to worry.
Fei already registered."

Citan
"Sounds good.
Fei is in the Tournament.
He will draw the guards'
attention.
Then Bart will enter the
castle through the
waterways via the well.
After that he will rescue
Marguerite from the
citadel.
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will 
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Tomorrow Fei will be in
the Tournament at Fatima
castle.
We will put on a good show
to distract the guards.
Then Bart will infiltrate
the castle through the
underground waterways
by way of the well.
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

Citan
"Preparations for our
plan are complete.
Tonight we will stay in
the hotel and start out
tomorrow.
We are free to do what we
like for now. 
Let us have a look around
the town."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Good work. Get plenty
of rest for tomorrow."

Going out again?
    Yes
    Get some rest

Citan
"Are you sure?
Please do not come 
back too late."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Good.
Save your energy
for tomorrow."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Come back after you
have registered for
the Tournament."

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Well, I'm all ready so
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Man, I'm beat."

More sightseeing 
in Aveh?
    Yes
    Rest
	
Bart
"Yeah, tomorrow will be 
tough for both of us."
