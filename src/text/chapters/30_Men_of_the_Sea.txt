Men of the Sea - Thames Deck - 1238
————————————————————————————

Dolphin
I was so surprised
there are people living
afloat on the vast sea.
On top of that, you
were with two Gears.
That's unheard of.

Elly
"Thanks. 
You helped us out..."

Dolphin
You'd better thank the
Captain. 
The one who gave the order
for us to pull you two
floaters out was the
Captain o' the Thames.

Fei
"Thames? 
Captain...?"

Dolphin
The Thames, the city at sea.
That is where you are now.
The captain here is a bit
of a strange old chap.
You'll see when you meet
him. That's not to say
he's a bad old blighter.

Elly
"Um...
What about our Gears?"

Dolphin
Don't worry about it. We
put them inside the Thames
through the supply dock.
Sea water got inside so
it'll take some time to
fix them.

Fei
"You're repairing 
them for us?"

Dolphin
Pretty strange for us to
be so nice, I bet that's
what you're thinking.
But really, we had no
choice because it's the
Captain's orders...

Well, I have to go now.
I'm a busy guy, y'know!
Come to the bridge after
you've looked around the
ship a while.
I'm sure the Captain would
want to meet you.

Elly
"Fei, 
what's wrong?"

Fei
"I feel like I've seen
that guy somewhere
before...
Never mind."

————————————————————————————

Little Boy
Hey, have you met the
Captain yet? He is sooo
cool! I wanna grow up to
be just like him.

I am!

A man!

of the sea...
...Hey wait? Oops.

It's over here.
I still need more
practice.

Battler 1
It's so...hot.

Battler 2
It's so...hot.

Shopkeep
Hey! 
If you need something
from my store, go talk
to my stupid son.

Shopkeep's Son
Hey, come on in.

Shopkeep
Hey!
You've got your eyes on
something good...Damn.
You know what this is?

...is what it is.
Pretty cool, huh?

Fei
...

Shopkeep
Hey, wait a minute.
This isn't for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

————————————————————————————

Shopkeep
Hey!
For being so young you
have good taste. Damn.
This is...

...is what it is.
Isn't this just bad?

Fei
...

Shopkeep
Hey, wait a minute.
This is not for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

————————————————————————————

Shopkeep
Hey!
I'm damn sure you'll like
this.
This is...

Oh?

Ohhh?

...is what it is.
Isn't this just great?

Fei
...

Shopkeep
Hey, wait a minute.
This is not for sale.
Sorry, I can't sell it.

————————————————————————————

Shopkeep's Son
Damn!!
You dumb old man.
All you make is useless
crap! Why don't you make
something that'll sell!?

Shopkeep
Whaddya saying?
Stupid kid!!
There ain't no way you
could ever understand
the soul and romance of
a Thames' man!

Shopkeep's Son
What the?
The soul of a Thames' man!?
If they were all as dumb as
you, the Thames'd have gone
under long ago!"

Thames vendor
Hey, welcome.
Rare finds from the sea
bottom on parade.

Little Girl
My big brother's a real
wimp, he's scared of
heights...
Pathetic. 
Just calm down.

Little Boy
My lil' sister pushed me.
She always picks on me.
I'm so scared.

Man 1
Queenie is so beautiful.

Man 2
Queenie is so strong.

Queenie
Wow, you suck. Why don't
you come back when you've
gotten a little better!
You'd better practice
somewhere other than
Thames. What? You don't
know what I'm talking
about? Hah! I KNOW you
know what I'm talking
about!

Thames Supply Entrance - 1242
————————————————————————————

Man 1
This is the supply
entrance.
This is where all the
treasure, armor and other
materials are brought up
from the sea.

Man 2
This new job the 'Ethos' sent
me on is my first BIG job.
I'm a little worried whether
I'll be able to do it or not.
They want me to go down
deeeep and get something
unimaginably big. Something
awesome's down there.

Little Boy 1
This gun is totally
coooool! With this, I can
blow away any bad guy!
BAM! 
BLAM! BOOM! 
Just thinking about it
gives me a rush!

Troubled Boy
Hey pal, will ya
listen to my problems?
    Sure
    Nah

————————————————————————————

Hmph! Don't need your
help. I can figure it out
on my own.

————————————————————————————

Until recently, I've always
wanted to be a seaman and
navigate the Thames!!
That was my plan...
But, lookin' at all that
treasure and stuff bein'
moved around...
...Well, it made me wanna
become a master crane
operator so I could control
that machine at my will...

What'ya think I should do?
    Become a crane master
    Be a seaman
    I don't know
	
————————————————————————————

Yeah, you're right...
a crane master.

————————————————————————————

Yeah, you're right...
a seaman.

————————————————————————————

Yeah, you're right...
It'd be best if I
decided myself.

————————————————————————————

Scavenger
Ya know, awhile ago,
I found treasure that's
thi----s big.

Dark-skinned Man
What're you talkin'
about? I found one that's
thi-------s big!

Scavenger
I found one that's

...big.

————————————————————————————

Little Boy 2
They say that girl is
crazy about treasure.
Someday, I'll become a
world renowned treasure
hunter and give her all
my treasure.

Little Girl
This supply
entrance has 4
treasure boxes. 
They're in plain view, but
can you get them all?

Men are stupid.
They're so happy
with that crap.

Sea Man
I've never been on dry 
land since I was born.
Think about it. You have 
dirt on your feet. 
How can you do that?

Little Boy
Nope.
I'm not trying to drink.

Man 1
There's nuttin' betta
than a drink after work.

Man 2
Hey, hey, I've never seen
you workin' around here.

Man 3
Huh? Well, don't worry
'bout the details
too much.

Man 2
Awwwww man!
I'd die for this
glass of booze.

Man 3
Hey, how many times
do you plan on dying?

Man 2
No kidding.

Captain
"You're the two winos who
floated in with the Gears."

Fei
"I don't really like
wandering around..."

Captain
"Gahahahaha. Well, don't
take it so badly.
For us, anything we pull
out of the sea is treasure.
And you're a really big
important treasure.
We were really careful."

Elly
"Um...
Thanks for helping."

Captain
"What a pretty lady.
Oh, don't make that face.
I won't bite.
I'll return your Gears
to you squeaky clean."

Elly
"Why are you being
so kind?"

Captain
"That's because..."

I am!

a man!

of the sea!

Elly
...

Fei
...

Captain
"Gahahaha..."

Captain
"You're probably starved.
I'll get you some food."

Captain
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaans!
I'll welcome the guests!
You take care of the rest."

Hans
"Yessir.
Just don't over do it."

Captain
"Of course I know that. 
How can you be so calm?"

Hans
"The captain and everyone
are so irresponsible."

Captain
"Hmph, yeah yeah."

Captain
"Lemme go and get
things ready."

Fei
"What? 
Who's that?"

Elly
"They don't look like...
such bad people."

————————————————————————————

Hans
Let me introduce my
self. I'm Hans, the
ship's first mate.

Drunkard
Huh?
Isn't this a beer hall?

Man
You can talk to other
areas aboard the Thames
through that intercom.

Bird Man
I remember seein' a high
tower a long time ago. It
was called Babel Tower.
Even I can't see the top of
it, and my eyes are good!
They say the Reapers called
Wels come from there.

Old Man
I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.
I'm not losing it to some
young upstart.

————————————————————————————
Thames Beer Hall - 1236
————————————————————————————

Captain
"Took you a while, but
things aren't ready yet."

Captain
"Hey, hurry it up!
Don't make our
guests wait."

Captain
"Sorry, there's no place
to sit around here."

Captain
"But, isn't the view just
splendid from here? This
beer hall is Thames' pride.
You probably think it's a
wee bit peculiar having a
beer hall right next to the
bridge, but tis fine by me.
If you don't take time in
life to enjoy a drink, you
will be swallowed by the
waves of anxiety...
...But we don't have that
problem. Thanks to this
beer hall, everyone here is
too sloshed to worry!"

Fei
"Are you always wandering
the seas like this?"

Captain
"Well, normally.
There is that crane that
fished you out. 
We use that or the Gears
to pull up treasure from
the sea. We're Salvagers.
Recently however,
there has been almost
no treasure...
just little things.
Since we've started the
big job, well, that's all
we've had."

Elly
"Big job?"

Captain
"Oh, that's a job for the
'Ethos'.
The 'Ethos' is planning
a really big salvage next.
I don't know the details
but, looks like we'll be
searching for some buried
treasure."

Fei
"Why is the 'Ethos'
involved...?"

Captain
"Who knows... But, we're
dependent on the 'Ethos'
to buy our stuff.
So, it won't look good
if we turn the job down."

Captain
"Well, dinner's finally
ready. Let's eat."

Kelvena
"We've got sonar.
......
That's not it. This
type...It matches with
the Aveh pirate ship,
Yggdrasil."

Dominia
"Yggdrasil?
Wasn't she sunk in 
another battle?"

Kelvena
"There's no record of
its sinking. We were too
busy fighting that red
Gear to try to confirm it."

Dominia
"Then, there is a chance
that it did not sink...
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was the
carrier for that Gear."

Kelvena
"One moment......
Yes, that is correct."

Dominia
"Excellent.
Give me the controls."

Kelvena
"Excellent?
What are you planning on
doing?"

Dominia
"Sink it, of course.
She will never trouble the
Commander again."

Kelvena
"Wait. The Commander's
orders were to investigate
the disappearance of that
flying battleship. 
We can't deviate from 
our mission.
Besides, we are low on
fuel and need to refuel."

Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."

Kelvena
"...Groan... Once you
start, there is no
stopping you is there?
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different than
fighting on land."

Dominia
"Of course. Sorry,
Kelvena."

Elly
"It's too far, I can't

It gets my blood boiling!"

Captain
"Hey Hans, I haven't
fired the big gun in
a long time.
How about we take a
shot or two?"

Hans
"Are you kidding?
Why get the Thames involved
in a fight between sides
who are neither enemies 
nor allies?
And that big gun is nothing
but a useless piece of junk
you tacked onto the Thames
in a drunken stupor!"

Captain
"You just don't
understand the code of
the men of the sea..."

He's still alive.
Alright!
We can't just sit here!
Let's go!"

"Go where?"

Fei
"To help, what else?"

Elly
"Without a Gear?"

Fei
"Hmm..."

Captain
"Hold yer horses."

Captain
"Dock, this is the

guests' Gears?"

The repairs will
be done shortly.

Captain
"Two minutes."

Huh?

Captain
"Finish in two minutes!
Then take them out 
through the supply 
entrance to the deck!"

Y, yessir!

Captain
"Your Gears are being
moved to the deck.
Go get'em.
If you need to you can
buy equipment at the
supply entrance shop."

Hans
"What are you saying
Captain?
What if we get bombed
while we're caught up in
the middle of a fight?"

Captain
"Be quiet!!
Our guests are fighting
to save their friends.
Don't get in the way!
If we don't help, it'll
tarnish the men of the
sea's good name!!"

Hans
"......Yessir.
But the Thames itself will
not join in any fights."

Fei

than enough."

He said he was going to

depth charges were ready.
But he left without the
proper hydropreps...
We are busy trying to
ready the depth charges.
Your Gears should be able
to handle underwater

Go help him out."

What are you doing
here?"

Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are you here?"

Dominia
"Why? We Gebler need no
special reasons to sink
an enemy ship!
It is our divine duty to
rule those crass land
dwelling Lambs."

Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
us Shepherds, the -Abel- ?"

Dominia
"To me -Lambs- and -Abel-
are the same.
The only definite
differenece is
personal ability.
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is our job.
Look what you've gained
as an Element, Elly.
Why do you even question?
Your superiority
is obvious!"

Elly
"...So the wise harming
the weak is a sign of
ability?
I didn't want that...
That's all!!"

Fei
"Elly,
are you alright?"

Dominia
"That Gear, you're the
one? Hah! So that's how
it is.
How amusing, Elhaym.
All this for a man?
I guess that story was
true after all.
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."

Elly
"Stop!
Don't say another word!"

Dominia
"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, mongrel!?
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"

Elly
"...I will.
If you Gebler

The ship that saved
us is nearby.
They call it the Thames,
and it's about the size of
a small city.
Their Captain can help us."
