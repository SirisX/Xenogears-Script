Above Mahanon - Fei in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

Suddenly the howling erupted.
Even the people who had not
mutated were being turned...
                   into Wels.
 
They howled out like war
cries, as if to call out
to something.

————————————————————————————

That was because Ramsus
had been manipulated into
assassinating the Emperor.
 
Now, with nothing else
holding them back, the
Ministry had put into
use the 'Gaetia Key'...
 
The effect of which was to
alter those people who had
been destined by god.

————————————————————————————

Those people destined by god,
regardless of whether they
were surface dwellers or
Solarians, began to change
shape, one after the other...
 
The howling was the people,
who had filled the earth,
calling out to god.
"Once humans have filled the
  earth, god will awaken from
   his long sleep...
 And the awakening of Mahanon,
  the paradise in the sky,
   will soon follow..."
 
The true meaning of what the
Ministry had spoken, the true
nature of that legend, was at
last beginning to be realized.

This is what they meant when
they said "once humans have
filled the earth"...
 
Eventually, 'Mahanon',
the resting place of god,
woke from its long slumber
and began to rise...
...almost as if responding
to the call of the people.
 
It appeared before us in
all its magestic glory... (*-ERROR-???spelling*)

Fei in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

Solaris - Gazel Ministry sent
a massive force there to
obtain "god and his wisdom".
 
...But, by now, neither the
nation of Solaris, nor the
organization known as Gebler,
existed anymore.
 
The only thing that was left
there was an innumerable
accumulation of weapons.

Almost all of the Solarians
had been transfigured into
weapons...
 
The Gazel Ministry now
reigned over them as
their commanders.

There was no way we could
allow god or god's wisdom
to fall into the hands of
the ministry.
 
We decided to assemble
all the forces we could
and head toward Mahanon.
It was a perilous battle.
There was no guarantee
that we would make it
back alive.
 
We were to carry out the
plan at dawn. Hence, I
had to stiffen my resolve
concerning 'her'...

Elly
"Wait a minute!
You want me to stay here?
No, I'm going with you!"

Fei
"No.
It's too dangerous..."

Elly
"Why? I've been in many
dangerous situations.
This isn't the first time!"

Fei
"I said NO!
We can't take you.
Please, understand!"

Elly
"No, I want to go!"

Elly
"We've been fighting
together all this time!
And suddenly you're
telling me not to go!?
I just don't get it!!"

Fei
"This isn't like any other
fight!
It's a battle for the
wisdom created by god.
It's life or death.
Whoever controls it,
becomes the true dominator
of the world!
It's obvious the Ministry
will bring the strongest
possible troops.
There is no guarantee
you'll come back alive!"

Elly
"That's exactly why
I want to go..."

Fei
"You don't have the
slightest idea..."

Elly
"What don't I understand!?"

Fei
"If the enemy were only the
Ministry or just mechanical
weapons it would be okay.
But most of the enemies
will be made up of what
were once humans... Humans
just like you and I!"

Elly (*???add*)
!

Fei
"I saw them at those
facilities... Gears that
were made out of humans.
They were the same as
Hammer...
Could you now destroy them
after knowing this!?
In order to save ourselves,
can you truly say that you
could kill those who were
once our friends!?
So, do you still want to go
now!?"

Elly
"W, well..."

Fei
"You can't even kill one
person.
Your presence would be
a burden during the fight."

Elly (*???add*)
!?

Fei
"You'd just get
in the way..."

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
Don't you think you went
a little too far there?"

Citan
"We cannot blame her.
At least we should
understand her feelings."

Fei
"I know how Elly feels.
I knew she wouldn't have
listened to me if I had
just said, 
'You're not coming!'.
Seeing as she has worked
together with us for such
a long time and all...
That's why I had to
explain it to her like
that..."

Fei
"The people gathered in
Nisan need Elly.
She's gotta realize how
much people are depending
on her.
I can't put her in a
dangerous situation..."

Margie
"But the way you said
it was a little harsh."

Billy
"You didn't have to be so
cold. She was crying, you
know?"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"I am sure she
realizes that."

Bart
"I agree.
Maybe you are the one
who doesn't understand?"

Fei
"Me?...
I don't understand?"

Margie
"A lady's...heart...?"

Billy
"She wants to go,
to be with you, Fei...
Until the end."

Margie (*???add*)
Yeah.

Bart
"If I were you...
I'd hold her tight
and say...
'Let's go together!'
...Just like that!"

Margie
"Really?"

Bart
"Um...no...
I mean...
errh..."

Maison
"Young master, don't
overdo yourself now..."

Bart (*???add*)
Ah, shut up!

Bart
"Anyhow, why don't you go
ask her to come with you?
Whether she'll go or not,
you should express your
feelings in words.
If you really care about
her, you have to go tell
her."

Citan
"Express your feelings...
right?"

Fei
"I, I didn't mean...!"

Bart
"Too late now.
Everyone knows it."

Citan
"You are not being true
to yourself, are you?"

Margie
"I agree."

Emeralda
"Fei...say it...
straight out..."

Margie
"Go ahead...
Go chase after her!
What are you waiting for?"

————————————————————————————
???

Citan
"Fei...is it not the time
for you to come out with
your feelings now?"

Bart
"C'mon now!
Go for it!"

Billy
"You don't know how to
treat a lady, do you?"

Rico
"I don't know much about
this kinda thing...
...but Hammer used to
tell me to
'be nice to women!'..."

Emeralda
"Fei...go..."

Chu-Chu
"Don't chu worry about me.
Please hurry and go chu
her!!"

Maria
"That's not the way
to treat her!"

Margie
"Women don't like
insensitive men!"

Maison
"I'm not well versed in
the art of romance."

Yggdrasil - Elly's Quarters - 1206
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Ah...sorry about what just
happened... Forgive me...
But, I want to explain...
Now for the first time,
people, on both earth and
Solaris, are becoming one.
But then, not all of them
are strong like the crew
of this ship, or the
people in Shevat.
Even we almost lose sight
of our future at times...
so you can imagine what
regular people go through.
That's why people need
someone like you to
depend on...
As a light to guide us.
You freed the hearts of the
people that have been used
as tools by that Ministry
for hundreds of years.
Elly, it was you!
And now your body doesn't
just belong to you alone
anymore.
That's why I can't let you
be in any danger.
And that's why I don't want
you to fight anymore."

Elly (*???add*)
...It's funny, isn't it?

Fei (*???add*)
Huh?

Elly
"We used to be enemies,
but now we're together
like this..."

Elly
"In the beginning...
I think I saw myself
in you.
We seemed to overlap...
You being in a similar
situation as I was in.
When I was with you,
I didn't feel alone or
apprehensive. That's why
I thought I liked you...
But, it wasn't that.
I simply didn't have
the courage to look at
my true self.
I turned to you to run
away from it all...
I mistook that for love."

Elly
"But, it's different now.
I can face my own problems.
I am me...and you are you.
It has all become clear
to me now.
I also learned that I
really do need you...
It's not because I need
you as a sanctuary for
my problems. I need you
because I truly love you."

Fei (*???add*)
Elly...

Elly
"I know what you're saying,
Fei. I know why you're so
concerned for my safety...
But you know, I'm...scared.
I fear we may never see
each other again...
I just have this feeling."

Fei
"Don't worry,
I won't die."

Elly
"No, it's not that...
It's something completely
different...
It's as if I'm being torn
apart by something I can't
resist...
That I'm no longer me...
Even if you come back
safely... It still...
It just feels so uneasy...
That is why I need to go
with you.
I can't bear to be away
from you."

Fei
"I feel the same way...
Ever since the time I met
you in that forest...
I think it's the same
feeling that you've been
having...
I was also running to you.
But I have to solve my own
problems.
I can't throw my problems
onto you."

Fei
"There is another me...
'Id' is within me.
I fear that at any moment
Id may awaken within me.
You're the only one that
has been able to keep me
from giving in to Id.
It was because you were
always by my side that I
was still able to keep
from losing myself."

Fei
"I promise you that
I will return.
So...that is...Elly,
I want you to be my reason
to return... To be my home
that I can return to...
Elly, if you will wait for
me to come back...
even if we are in totally
different places...
As long as you will stay
by my side...
I know I'll be able
to do anything..."

Elly (*???add*)
Oh, Fei...

Elly (*???add*)
Are you going now?

Fei
"Yeah, sorry.
Did I wake you?"

Elly
"It's okay.
I've been awake
all along..."

Fei (*???add*)
All along?

Elly
"Uh-huh.
I was watching over
you while you slept...
And before I realized
it, it was morning..."

Fei (*???add*)
...

Fei
"W, well, I'm off."

Elly
"Alright then...
Do be careful..."

Fei
"Yeah, I will...
Oh! Could you hold
on to this for me?"

Elly
"What is this?
Is this a...pendant?"

Fei
"I don't know whose it is.
It seems it was on me when
I was brought into Lahan.
It may be mine, or it
could be..."

Elly (*???add*)
It could be...?

Fei
"Oh, nothing...
Will you just hold
on to it for me?"

Elly
"Alright.
I'll hold on
to it for you."

Fei
"Thanks.
...Well,
I guess it's goodbye!"

Elly (*???add*)
Oh... Fei.

Fei (*???add*)
Yeah?

Elly
"Thank you..."

Nisan - 1950
————————————————————————————

Margie
"Elly.
Are you okay
about this?
Don't you want
to be with him?"

Elly
"Yes...
But, it's because
I believe in him.
Just being close to a
person is not in itself
an indication of love,
is it?"

Margie
"But...
men are selfish...
When something big happens,
they say...
 'It's too dangerous...
  You can't come!'
They treat women like we
are weaklings."

Margie
"Although, it is true
I can't help Bart and
friends much anymore..."

Elly
"That's not true.
Everyone, wants someone 
special waiting for them.
Someone who will protect
a place they can return
to.
If you don't have that
peace of mind, then you
would not be able to get
anything done..."

Elly
"Men try to tough it out
as much as they can, and
then some...
They're cute the way they
do that, aren't they?"

Margie
"Yeah,
you're right..."

Elly
"Anyway, we have things
we have to do too, now.
And, while we do them,
let's pray that everyone
comes back safely."

Margie
"To god?"

Elly
"No...
To your own innermost
feelings that everyone
believes in..."

Elly
"What's wrong?"

Margie
"I knew it...
Yes, that must be it!"

Elly
"What?"

Margie
"Elly, it's like everyone
says! You must be a
reincarnation of Sophia!
You have no way of knowing
the Nisan Sect's teachings,
but what you say...
...well, it's exactly the
same as what Sophia always
said."

Elly
"Yes...
That might be it."

————————————————————————————

Elly
"The first time I
visited here I had the
most amazing feeling."

Elly
"Familiar...
Sad...
Like I had visited here
many times in my dreams..."

Elly
"I know where each room
is and what's in them.
I just know I must have
been here in the distant
past..."

Elly
"Before, if you had spoken
of this I'd have brushed
it off with a laugh.
But now..."

Now, I can more or
less believe it.

Elly
"The things I couldn't
do then...
I'm probably trying to
do now..."

Margie
"Things you couldn't
do...?"

————————————————————————————

Elly
"...Yes.
Things I couldn't do..."

Mahanon - Eldridge hull - 1844
————————————————————————————

Driving back the Solarian
interceptor forces, we
took to the floating
continent, Mahanon.
 
It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
with a diameter of at
least 40 kelts.
 
Judging from the condition
of the hull, we estimated
the ship was thousands of
years old.

————————————————————————————
 
It was determined, by
examining the inside
of the wreckage, that
some kind of accident
occured on this ship
about 10,000 years ago
...which forced it to
crash onto our planet.

"Alien beings that came
to our planet from a far
off galaxy, aeons ago..."

Could it possibly have been
that our ancestors were the
passengers of this ship and
had crash landed here on
this planet...
 
Seeking god and his divine
wisdom...'Razael's Tree'...
which, it is said, lie here in
Mahanon, we proceeded further.
