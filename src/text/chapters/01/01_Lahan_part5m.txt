Dan
"Oh good, Fei!
Ya ready to talk?"

Dan
"As you know, tomorrow's
finally the day of my
sister's wedding...
So, what I want to talk
to you about is exactly
that... Alice's marriage!"

Dan
"Fei, to be perfectly
honest with you...
I've always wished
you could have been
my brother."

Dan
"It's still not too late.
You could go steal Alice
and run off with her!
If you need me to help,
I'd be glad to!"

Dan
"It may be odd for me to say
this, but my sister's
beautiful and a good cook...
(and this is just between
you and me but, she's
well endowed too! 
Heh heh heh!)"

Dan
"So c'mon! Go for it!
    Let's do it!!
    That's crazy 

Fei
"Alright Dan,
you've got it...
I guess I'll just go sweep
Alice away and make a run
for it!"

Dan
"Really!?
I knew I liked you, Fei!
That's the spirit!"

Dan
"... But, if only
it was that easy...
It's not like we can
change their feelings...
And you would need to
have love for her too..."

Dan
"But, I'm not gonna
forget this, Fei!
You were really willing to
go that far to help me...
Fei, you're a good guy!"

Dan
"Well, the least we can
do is pray for Alice's
happiness, hey Fei!"

Fei
"Hey...
What are you talking
about, Dan?
Timothy and Alice are both
my best friends.
You know I can't do that!"

Dan
"Tch, yeah I know that.
Well if you're gonna be
like that..."

Dan
"But, if you change your
mind, come and talk to
me!"

Dan
"So Fei, you up to it?
C'mon, let's do it!
    Let's do it!!
    Quit bein' foolish
