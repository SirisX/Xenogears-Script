Chief Lee
"Oh, it's you, Fei.
We're in the middle
of discussing Timothy
and Alice's wedding
arrangements."

Chief Lee
"Hey, why don't you bring
a girlfriend or two home
once in a while?
Just because you live with
an old man like me doesn't
mean you have to hold back
now, you hear!?
Why, when I was as young
as you are, it seemed like
everyday I would..."

Ahem!
Ohum!

Chief Lee
"Oh, errh... never mind.
Now, we still have
important things to
discuss... so don't
get in the way now."

Chief Lee
"We still have many
important things to
talk about...
So you had better
not bother us now."

Timothy's Father
"Hello there, Fei.
Our Timothy is a really
lucky boy to be able to
marry such a beautiful
girl like Alice!
I hope you come up with
some embarrassing tales
to tell in your speech!
Hah haah haaah!"

Alice's Uncle
"I don't know whether to be
happy or sad...
Tomorrow, our little Alice
is going to become someone's
wife...
I knew this day would come!
...This is the worst part of
bringing up a little girl!"

Sigh...

Woman
You know Fei, I am sure that
our village chief thinks of
you as his own grandson...
Not having any family for
all those years, and living
on his own for oh so long...
That's why he cares so very
dearly about you!

Please, never do anything that
would break his poor old heart!
You promise me that, Fei!?

Timothy
"Could you go check up
on Alice for me...?
The old man and I have
still got to discuss
things with her uncle
and the village chief."

-AFTER- After visiting Alice

Timothy
"So how was Alice? I still
can't believe we're really
getting married tomorrow!
It's such a weird feeling.
We've always been together
ever since we were just
little kids..."
