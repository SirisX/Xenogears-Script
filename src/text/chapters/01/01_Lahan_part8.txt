Woman outside Alice's house
You know you won't come out
in one piece if you try and
pull anything on the bride!

Alice's Aunt
"Why hello, Fei. Have you
come to visit our Alice?
She's upstairs right now.

Alice's Aunt
"But doesn't time fly...?
It has already been ten
years since my brother
and his wife passed away.
We did our best to raise
the two children in their
place..."

Alice's Aunt
"But now, as far as
Alice is concerned,
I can finally say my
job is done.
I know Timothy will
take good care of
her from here on...
Now all that's left
is Dan...
I'm going to have a
hard time raising
him to adulthood."

Sigh...

-AFTER- Talking to Alice

Alice's Aunt
"Tomorrow, please pray
for Alice's happiness.
And, from here on as well,
I want you to stay the best
of friends with both Alice
and Timothy. Thanks, Fei!"
