Timothy
"Yo! Hi there, Fei.
Sorry for us all using
your house like this.
But, we have to talk about
the big day tomorrow with
the village chief."

Fei
"Yeah tomorrow, huh...
Your wedding with Alice!
Now that is a big day!"

Timothy
"Yeah... right...
But it still hasn't hit
me as reality though."

Fei
"Hey, errh, Timothy.
I just want to thank
both you and Alice...
3 years ago, I woke up
in this village without
a trace of my memory...
I didn't know who I was,
where I had been or what
I had been doing up until
that day...
I couldn't recall a
single thing..."

Fei
"Despite that, you and
Alice sympathized with me
and encouraged me to go on.
If the two of you hadn't
have been there for me,
I don't know what would
have become of me..."

Fei
"Timothy...
From the bottom of my
heart, I thank you!
Now, you and Alice
had better live
happily ever after!"

Timothy
"Hah! Quit it will ya!
You don't have to go and
get all mushy on me...
Anyway, to me it feels
like I've always been
friends with you ever
since we were kids."

Timothy
"And we will go on being
friends forever, right?"

Fei
"Of course!"

Timothy
"Oh yeah, Fei...
Could you stop by
and check on Alice?
I still have stuff to
discuss with my old man
and the village chief.
But I'm sure she'll
be glad to have some
company."

Fei
"Yeah, sure!
I'll do that... Anyway,
I'll see you later.
Oh, and I am really
looking forward to the
ceremony tomorrow."

Dan
"So there you are!
Fei, I have to talk to
you about something!"

Fei
"Why, hello there Dan!
You're lively today...
as you are everyday!"

Timothy
"Dan! Don't be so rude.
What's this barging in
and all?"

Dan
"Argh! Timothy's
here too."

Dan
"Butt out, Timothy!
Until you marry my
sister, you have
nothing to do
with me at all!
I just have some
business here with
my friend Fei!"

Dan
"So anyway Fei, I errh...
I have something to talk
to ya about later..."

Fei
"What is it, Dan?
It sounds serious!"

Dan
"Yeah, that's why I can't
talk about it here...
There's a certain person
listening in who could
cause us trouble...!"

Dan
"It's really important!
We gotta talk, seriously,
one-on-one, man-to-man!
I'll be hanging around
outside. So I'll see
ya there later, OK!"

Dan
"Be seein' ya, Timothy!
Take care of yourself
until tomorrow..."

Fei
"Huh...? 
What's up with him?"

Timothy
"As of tomorrow, I'm
going to be that kid's
brother-in-law...
Hah!
That part isn't going
to be no honeymoon!"
