Fei
"Hello, Alice.
Is that your
wedding dress?"

Alice
"Oh!?
Fei, you startled me!"

Alice
"Yes it is...
I just finished it. It took
more work than I expected."

Fei
"Hmmm...
You did a great job there!
It'll look wonderful
on you, Alice...
Congratulations."

Alice
"Thank you.
..."

Alice
"..."

Fei
"Hey, uh, Alice..."

Alice
"Oh, um, Fei..."

Fei
"What is it?"

Alice
"Oh, nothing..."

Fei
"I see..."

Alice
"Um...
Oh yes, that's right..."

Alice
"Fei, 
have you seen Dan?"

————————————————————————————
-BEFORE- Talking to Dan

Fei
"Knowing him, he's
most probably outside
gasbagging right now."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Yeah, he's outside...
bragging as always."

————————————————————————————

Alice
"Ugh, that kid!
I just told him that I had
an errand for him to run!"

Fei
"Oh yeah?
What kind of errand?"

Alice
"It's for my wedding
ceremony tomorrow...
I was hoping he could go
borrow a camera and some
lights from Doctor Uzuki,
up on the mountain peak."

Fei
"If that's all it is,
I'll be glad to do it
for you."

Alice
"Could you?
Oh, but I couldn't
possibly..."

Fei
"Don't worry!
It's no problem!
Anyway, it doesn't exactly
make me feel comfortable
having Dan handle such
delicate instruments.
What's more, I might have
a chance to eat some of
Yui's cooking if I go to
the doc's place."

Alice
"Hee-hee...
That's my Fei!"

Fei
"Well, I'll go up there
now and get them for you!"

Alice
"Oh...
Fei, wait!"

Fei
"Huh...? Is there
something else you want
me to get from Citan?"

Alice
"No...
It's not that..."

Fei
"... ?"

Alice
"Fei...
Have you ever thought
about things this way?"

Alice
"If... If, you had
only been born in
this village...
And if we had only
known each other
earlier on..."

Fei
"..."

Alice
"...
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm sorry..."

Fei
"...
Well, I think I had
better get going now!"

Alice
"Oh, OK...
Be careful on that
mountain path.
And give my regards
to Doctor Uzuki!"

Alice
"...
Is this fate...?"

Alice
"I feel so foolish...
Who am I kidding?"

-AFTER- Leaving the room

Alice
"...
Say hello to Doctor
Uzuki for me..."
