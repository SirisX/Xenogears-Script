Fei
"Huh? ... 
Someone's coming downstairs.
...I guess it'll be Hammer."

Rico
"...Long time no 
see, huh, Kid!"

Fei
"Hey, you're...Rico!?
What are you doing here?"

Rico
"Calm down, kid!
I didn't come here
to fight with you..."

Fei
"Then what purpose do you 
have here? What other
reason could you have?"

Citan
"What is going on out there?
This is a place for rest!
Can you be a bit quieter..."

Citan
"Why, it is only you Fei!
And...
the Battling Champion?"

Citan
"What would the likes of
you have to do coming to
a prison barracks?
There must be some special
reason for you to grace 
us with your presence?"

Rico
"Yes there is.
...I came in regards to the
incident of the explosion
during the first rounds of
the Battling contest."

Fei
"Explosion incident?
...Oh, you mean what
happened the other day!"

Citan
"The explosion accident that
Fei was enveloped in during
that bout?
What has that got to do
with you?"

Rico
"...I'm sorry.
That 'accident' was set
up by my subordinates!
After the results of your
'Baptismal Ceremony', it
seems my men didn't come
to like you very much..."

Citan
"So they made it look like
an accident, but it really
was meant to kill Fei...
But why tell us now?
Did they come clean and
confess the crimes they 
committed?"

Rico
"...They're no 
longer with us!
You're the doctor, don't you
know what's been happening?
What's going on here in the
Imperial capital's D Block?"

Citan
"You mean the series of
mysterious murders that
happened in the sewers!?"

Rico
"...Yes. A line of skilled
Battlers have been murdered
one after the other!
All of the victims that
have been killed were
my subordinates..."

Rico
"Kid...
I mean, Fei...!
They were the very people
who had set that trap to 
kill you!"

Fei
"So what are you trying to
say? That their deaths are
connected to me somehow!?"

Citan
"Let us see... The murdered
Battlers had set a trap to
try and kill Fei...
When Fei comes to know of
this he has good reason 
to kill them...
Out of hatred of his would-
be killers, he plots
revenge on the Battlers.
And turns to 'murder'!"

Fei
"...People think
I am the killer?"

Rico
"Exactly!
This morning there was yet
another victim...the fifth!
It's not unusual for people
to die in the sewers.
If you become weak, you die
...that's providence!
But 5 Battlers were killed
in a row!
That this is unprecedented
alone casts doubt on you.
To say that I don't doubt
you would be lying, but
I don't think you are
guilty, either.
The only thing that can
prove your innocence is
if there is any truth in
that story going round...
The story of a monster in
the sewers that is strong
enough to kill 5 Battlers!"

Rico
"For the sake of my men
too, I am about to check
out the sewers.
I've said what I 
wanted to say..."

Fei
"Wait up! Let me...
Let me go with you!
I want to prove to you that
I am innocent myself!"

Rico
"You want to tag
along, huh?
I don't care.
But you've got to look
after your own neck!"

Citan
"It is up to Fei himself
to prove that he has 
been falsely suspected...
...There is no alternative,
then. Please allow me to
accompany you in solving
this sewer murder case!"

Rico
"...The doctor too? I don't
take any responsibility if
anything happens to you...!"

Battler 1
There was another victim in
the sewers. That makes four!
He wasn't a direct subordinate
of the Champ, but he was a
skilled extermination worker!

Battler 2
Another murder in the sewers!
This time it was Vargas...!
What in blazes is going on!?

Say, didn't you...
...Nothing, forget it!

Battler 3
A body of one of the Champ's
immediate subordinates was
found in the sewers!
Knowing that a monster big
enough to do that is lurking
below us...sure is scary!
It gives me the shivers!

Informer
Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!

The new medical doctor who
just came is quite skilled.
Have you seen him yet?

Battler with green hair
Hey, what...the?
Y...You're the
Ch, Champ!!

Rico
"Thanks for watching the
sewers. I'm going down
there now...
Don't let anyone besides
these guys in."

Battler with green hair
Yes sir, Champ!!

Fei
"Where is this place?"

Rico
"Let's look for it. 
We'll talk more if 
we really find it."

Fei
"Do you really doubt me?"

Citan
"Shh, quiet!"

Fei
"?
..."

Rico
"What's wrong...?"

Citan
"...!?
Well...let us look around."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Here...?"

Rico
"Well, this is the 
murder spot."

Fei
"What's this
slimy stuff?"

Rico
"No way's it human..."

Citan
"Look, here!"

Rico
"More of the same..."

Fei
"Something the
monster left?"

Citan
"Still...
we cannot be sure...
but it is very likely."

————————————————————————————

Rico
"Looks like he
got it here."

Fei
"Here too...?"

Rico
"Hey, this is the same as 
that stuff over there..."

Citan
"...Something is written  
on the wall...
Re...
Red...monster..."

Citan
"This must be his 
dying message."

Rico
"Must've written it
as he was dying."

Citan
"A red monster..."

Citan
"Very interesting."

Fei
"...!?"

Rico
"Something's down here, 
that's for sure..."

is there something here?"

Citan
"A tinkle sound...
I heard some kind
of a tinkle sound!"

Fei
"A bell...?"

Rico
"A bell!  
A bell...?"

Fei
"Do you know something?"

Rico
"Now that you mention
it...
There is a rumor of a 
strange ringing sound 
down here..."

————————————————————————————
Kislev Sewers Part 3 - 1086

Citan
"There is always slime
near the murder scene.
Looks like it only 
happened once."

Rico
"Whaddya talkin' about?"

Citan
"They say it will not
return to the same place...
I wonder?"

Fei
"!?

Fei
"Here too..."

Rico
"Ugh! ...There's that
smell again.
It's like something's 
burning..."

Citan
"Burnt...?
Hmm, I see..."

Rico
"Hey, look at this."

Rico
"The slime is over
by that drain too."

Citan
"It appears this slime
was left behind by the
monster."

————————————————————————————
Kislev Sewers Part 3 - 1086
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Here too."

Rico
"There's slime in
this drain too."

Citan
"Where does this
drain connect to?"

Rico
"It should connect to the
sewage treatment plant."

Rico
"Right! There must be a
place where they meet."

Citan
"!?
..."

Rico
"Hey, this is..."

Fei
"Yeah."

Citan
"There is something 
lurking around here, 
I am sure of it."

Citan
"Do you know where these 
drains come together?"

Rico
"Hmm. From here it's beside
the waterfall furthest to
the east of here."

————————————————————————————

Gramps
"Who're you?"

Rico
"Hey gramps!
What are you doing here?
I thought the entrance
was blocked off."

Gramps
"Hpmh.
I've lived here
for a long time."

Rico
"All by yourself? In a
spooky place like this?"

Gramps
"As you can see I'm a
mutant. So the monster
never bothers me."

Gramps
"But lately, my new
neighbor's been going
around bustin' things up."

Rico
"What, really?
We're looking for him."

Gramps
"Oh!
Would you get rid of
him for me?
If you need to know 
anything ask me.
I'll help you."

————————————————————————————

Gramps
"That's the passkey
for the sewers.
You can get into
the room beside the
waterfall with it."

Gramps
"Take care of 
yourselves."

————————————————————————————
Kislev Sewers Part 3 - 1086

Fei
"Is it here?"

Rico
"This room should connect 
to the sewage treatment 
plant."

Citan
"This is strange..."

Rico
"Hey, watch it!"

Fei
"Umph ...

Fei
"It won't open..."

Rico
"I'll do it!"

Rico
"Argh arrgh...
Damn! It won't open.
Damn it!"

Fei
"Hey..."

Rico
"...God dammit!
...no good...it won't 
open with out the key."

Citan
"A bell...!?
There is a bell inside."

Fei
"That bell must be..."

Fei
"Where's the key?"

Rico
"Vargas should have
had it.
He must have dropped
it somewhere when he
got killed...
Maybe even the rats
got it..."

Fei
"Are we sure the key
fell somewhere?"

Rico
"If it was dropped we 
should've been able to
find it."

Citan
"Anyhow we must search
for it now."

"What's this?"

Rico
"This is a rat-

Rico
"We call them the
'Catless Rat Removers'!"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"What is this?"

Rico
"No...
It's not broken...
Why isn't it moving?"

Rico
"Lemme see it."

Fei
"...!?"

Fei
"Ha!
There's something
inside.
...!?
Got it!"

Received Keys.

Rico
"!!...These were Vargas'
pass keys to the sewer.
They must've gotten 
caught up in this thing. 
That's why it wasn't 
moving?"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Can we open that
door with these?"

Rico
"Yeah, it should be there."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"I wonder what these
keys are for?"

Rico
"These are the keys to the
sewage treatment plant."

Citan
"Sewage treatment plant?"

Rico
"That's where all the 
sewage ends up."

Citan
"That is strange...
Where is it?"

Rico
"From here it's northeast
through the door and near
the furthest waterfall."

Fei
"Let's go and see."

"It moved..."

Fei
"It's not here..."

Citan
"It appears it can move 
outside through these
sewage drains."

We should of found 
it here!"

"Wait! 
We can lure it with 
this thing!"

Citan
"Hmmm...it does not look 
like it will show up now."

Rico
"Where can we use it?"

Citan
"Let us think about 
what we know so far."

Fei
"...??"

Sewer Horror - Kislev Sewers Part 3 - 1086

Fei
"Slime in the drain...
There should be several 
places like this."

Citan
"Yes.
This must be the one 
drain it comes and 
goes from."

Fei
"That's it!
We'll use the bell
there to lure it out."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Try and use this..."

Citan
"No, there is a murder 
scene near but this is
not it."

————————————————————————————

Gramps
"And you can lure it 
with this bell."

Fei
"Ring it here?"

Gramps
"Uh-huh, that's it..."

Gramps
"There is always slime
near the drains it uses.
And he never returns to
the same site twice."

Fei
"So we need a drain
with slime nearby and
no murder site."

Gramps
"Right. 
I think...there's one 
on this floor, north of
here."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"...!
Here!!"

Citan
"I am sure. This is the 
only drain with slime and
no murder site nearby."

Emperor
"Has he awoken...?"

Twice...no...three
times to be exact."

Citan
"May I ask you this...?
Why would he be moved to
a place like this...?
Was it the elders?"

Emperor
"Nay.
They're hoping for a
more immediate disposal.
I don't blame them.
They have a deeply
etched fear of him."

Citan
"Then..."

Emperor
"Yes. 
Probably..."

Citan
"It would be hasty to
dispose of him now.
I do not think it is
too late to wait
until we find out
his purpose..."

Emperor
"If that is your
judgment, then,
so be it."

Well then, allow
me to..."

Solaris Briefing Room - 0930
————————————————————————————

...The number one gate
generator is 200 kelt
southwest of Nortune and
4000 sharl underground.
Its interference waves make
guided weapon use impossible
in this area. So up to the
last minute the Hecht must
be piloted manually.
After canceling stealth
mode, you will provide
direct escort for the Hecht
inside the enemy defense
zone. Any questions?

Elly
"Well..."

Yes Lieutenant?

Elly
"I understand our escort
orders but what is our
main objective?"

That is classified.

Elly 
"But without knowing our
objective, our response to
any orders will be slow.
Even if we're just ordered
to provide cover.
We need to at least know
the attack objective..."

The objective will be issued
during the mission.
It will be relayed directly
to the Hecht's pilots.

Elly
"But..."

Your only concern is to
protect the Hecht from
the enemy's anti-aircraft 
weapons. 
Any problems with that?

Elly
"...No...
if that's the case..."

Anything else?

...Then this ends the 
main briefing.
Confirm terrain, weather
and enemy defense details
with the information at
hand.
The mission starts at
1700.
Until then wait in your
assigned units.
I shouldn't have to
remind you that this
mission is a purge.
Remember, we have
complete authority
over the Lambs. 
Dismissed.

Stratski
"This sucks Lieutenant.
How can we go along with
this? What's he mean the
objective has nothing to
do with us?"

Elly
"Be quiet!
I'm thinking!"

Stratski
"Don't snap at me."

Vance
"I hate hysterical women."

Elly
"Are you ready to take
the consequences for
that remark?"

Vance
"Uh..."

Elly
"Whew..."

Renk
"What's wrong?
Something 
bugging you?"

Elly
"Sorry I'm so edgy.
Those self-detonating
bombs are just air units
with Kief class bombs
on board.
I don't see why they
need to use them all of
a sudden...
There are just too many.
One of those alone would
have enough firepower,
but 8 of them is overkill.
They haven't told us our
target yet, and we're not
just going to drop them
for fun.
You bet I'm worried."

Helmholz
"Maybe to purge 
the Lambs?"

Elly
"They're human...
the same as us, right?
They have to give us a
reason. I can't go along
with this just because
it's an order."

Renk
"Hmm..."

Elly
"What?"

Renk
"Nothing..."

Renk
"Even though we are called
Solarians, we are 3rd Class
Citizens or 'Worker Bees'.
Us 3rd Class Citizens have
our origins in the 'Lambs'.
I can understand us having
doubts in such orders...
But you, you're different.
You're a pure 1st Class
Citizen and come from a
good family.
I've heard your father
has a lot of pull in the
military..."

Elly
"My family and father
have nothing to do
with it."

Renk
"Well, if you ask me,
a 1st Class citizen
thinking like this is...
a little unusual."

Elly
"Not really...
It's quite natural."

Helmholz
"...So, how about it?
Are you gonna do it?"

Stratski
"The army will demote
us all back to being
3rd Class citizens!"

Elly
"Don't worry. I'll just
do my duty. But I'm only
escorting the Hecht.
I won't help with 
anything else."

Helmholz
"...But, what if
something happens?
You're just backing
yourself into a corner."

Elly
"...Can't be helped,
I guess..."

Renk
"Well, either is fine
for us. Just do what
you're told.
Nothing else matters."

"You're late!
You made me wait for ages!"

Fei
"Oh, errh, sorry!"

Fei
"Later, the doc said he 
wanted to pay the courtesy
of burying the monster...
so I waited outside."

Rico
"...Is that so? Oh well,
at least the murders have
been brought to an end!"

Citan
"Yes, that is right.
And Fei has been proved
innocent as well!"

Rico
"...
And I guess the
out-of-bounds order on the
sewers was lifted straight
after that too ...
Anyway, my allying with you
ends here...
The next time we meet, Fei,
we will be opponents!"

Rico
"C'mon, try and beat me!
I'd enjoy seeing you try to
settle your scores with me!"

Fei
"Hey, what about that wound
to your arm? You can't try
to Battle in that state!"

Rico
"...
Can you really afford to 
worry about your opponent?"

Fei
"...But, Rico?"

Rico
"Worry about yourself before
others! Don't hold back now!
Give me your best fight!"

Rico
"If you don't do your best,
you could be the one who 
dies..."

Fei
"...
Understood..."

Rico
"Right.
That's good..."

Citan
"Right, now that that matter
is resolved, I have done all
I can do to help...
What is left is up to you,
Fei. You must settle this
other problem with your
own hands."

Fei
"...I guess so."

Citan
"Does his arm wound bother
you that much? Fei, you
realize we don't have..."

Fei
"I know doc...
we don't have much time to
spare!
What's more, what he says is
right - you shouldn't hold
back in a battle. Etiquette
dictates a true fight!"

Citan
"It seems I was overly
concerned.
Anyway, let us rest up now.
Remember, you must win up
to the Finals League first.
And the Champ is not the
only one you have to beat!"

Receptionist
"Wow, you're sooo strooong!
Boy, was he ever outmatched!
Ooh, I get goose bumps
at your overwhelming power!"

Hammer
"Bro, you did it! You won!
You're the Battling Champ!
...or, close enough anyway!
Victory is in reach! If you
just win tomorrow's Finals
League we'll have our names
cleared and be released!"

Fei
"But Hammer, you know my 
opponent is no pushover!
His power is incredible...
He's been Battling Champion
for three years straight!
Beating him's going to be
no easy task...
Up till today I've managed
to win somehow, but
tomorrow is another matter!
I doubt that I will win."

Hammer
"...If that's your attitude
you'll lose even if you
could've won!
Come on bro,
show some fighting spirit!"

Fei
"...Hahaha, I didn't think
you'd be the type to say
something like that!"

Fei
"You're right!
I'll never win with these
pre-battle blues.
Thanks Hammer!
Well then, let's head back
to our lodgings now."

Hammer
"I'd like to be able to say
'no problem', but tomorrow's
Finals League is important!
Don't you think you should
take care in servicing and
customizing your Gear?
Our fates depend on it!"

Fei
"...Gear servicing, heh?
Leaving it just to one
mechanic worries me a bit.
I'll ask the doc to give
us a hand also!"

Hammer
"A bit of a worry!?
That's not so Bro! 
This here mechanic is doing
the best he can, y'know!

Fei
"I didn't mean it that way,
so don't get all upset now,
Hammer!
Anyway, let's go back to 
our barracks and call the 
doc, shall we!?"

Hammer
"Wait! Don't you think you 
should save your Battling
record in the 'Memory Cube'!

Fei
"I suppose I should..."
