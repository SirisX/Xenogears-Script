Raid of Shevat! - Queen Zephyr's Chamber - 1512
————————————————————————————

Citan
"The Solaris Gear units are
on a high speed...
...interception course with
Shevat.
It would be reasonable to
believe that their main
targets are going to be the
4 Gate generators.
They are probably planning
on finishing us off since
Dominia's demolition has
weakened the Gate output.
We have scrambled our
interceptor units, but I
do not know how they will
fare...
The people of Shevat are
not accustomed to Gear
tactics.
I want to avoid unnecessary
sacrifices if at all
possible."

Fei
"Yeah...
I know, doc.
We'll go!
We're already involved.
And, we can't just stand
by and watch these
people die."

Zephyr
"Fei..."

Bart
"I don't like the idea of
working for free...
...but I don't like the
idea of turning tail and
running from them even
more!
Let's do it! It doesn't
matter who they are. I'll
take'em all down in my
Brigandier!!"

Elly
"Yes...!
We'll do what we can to
protect the people here!"

Rico
"Tch. Since the day I met
you all, there's been
nothing but trouble...
But I've come this far with
you all. I guess there's no
point in bitching about it.
I'll show them what happens
when they tick the great
Rico off."

Billy
"I will go too! The enemy
was able to get in because
they let the Yggdrasil in.
We can't allow the people
of this country to be in
danger because of us..."

Jessie
"Yeah, right on!
Go for it young'uns!
We're depending on you.
Especially since my life
also depends on it.
I have no intentions of
kickin' the bucket here."

Billy
"Shut up! Dad, could you
not say anything!?"

Jessie
"Alright alright, I
know."

Jessie
"Why can't you be
more nicer?"

Chu-Chu
"Alright! Chu-Chu's
going chu help too!"

Fei
"...?
Going chu help...?
Chu-Chu, what're
you doing here?"

Elly
"Well...
In all the bustle,
she somehow tagged along."

Fei
"What am I gonna do...
This isn't a game.
It's dangerous, so go back
to the Yggdrasil. Okay,
Chu-Chu? Be a good girl."

Chu-Chu
"Uh hmm... Chu-Chu's not
a good girl. I'm in that
dangerous age right now."

Chu-Chu
"And Chu-Chu
can help chu!
I'm going with
all of you.
Yeah? Yeah?"

Fei
"Tch, alright... Don't come
crying to me when things
get outta hand."

Maria
"Heh, so they call you
Chu-Chu also.
Many of your friends live
in this city. You want to
go meet them later?"

Chu-Chu
"R, really?
They're all here?
Yaaay! I finally found
them!! Chu-Chu's friends.
They're here!!"

Chu-Chu
"Now, let's put
everything into it.
Everyone, we have chu
give it our best shot!"

Citan
"Here is the breakdown of
the enemy Gear units...
As I have explained before,
4 separate units are each
headed for their respective
generators.
From the information
collected in Shevat...
...we have a good idea
of the capabilities and
composition of the Gear
units...
However, there is one giant
Gear that they are holding
back that we have no
information about."

Jessie
"An unidentified giant
Gear...?
It can't be..."

Zephyr
"Allow me to put it
on screen."

Maria
"Th, this is..."

Maria
"Achtzehn...!?"

Bart
"What's with that
creepy Gear...?
Do you know anything
Maria?"

Maria
"Achtzehn...
is the 2nd Gear my father
designed...
Seibzehn's
sister Gear.
But Achtzehn wasn't
completed...!
Other than Seibzehn
father didn't make anymore,
he was supposed to have
burned the plans...!
So...
Why...!?"

People of Shevat!
Hear me!

Maria
"That voice...
No...
Father!?"

Nikolai
"I'd heard some interesting
rats had run into there...
Just in time to test
out Achtzehn.
I can take you and Shevat
out all at once!
Hello, little rats,
come on out.
Come on my cute little
guinea pigs."

Maria
"Why that...!!
Why is father...!?"

Zephyr
"Calm down, Maria!!
It doesn't mean that
Dr. Nikolai is inside!"

Maria
"But...!!
But... 
Father's voice...!?"

Zephyr
"Maria!!
Get a hold of yourself!
You intend to lose even
before you fight...?
Against the very people
who made you suffer?"

Maria
"...!!
But..."

Citan
"Well that is fine.
Let us consider our
next move!"

Citan
"We must repulse the Gear
forces and protect the
generator."

Citan
"To do that let us split
into four teams, and
intercept the enemy.
The four of us will attack
independently and defend
each generator to the death.
The other two, wait here.
It is dangerous...but we
cannot turn back now.
If even one generator falls
it is a defeat for us."

Zephyr
"Maria...
You, wait here."

Citan
"...
Please Maria."

Maria
"...
Okay...
I understand."

Citan
"Next, the formation of
the enemy Gear forces.
At Generator 1, there
are two small Gears and
a complement of Solaris
troops...
If you do not hit them
fast and hard you will
get bogged down in a
firefight.
At Generator 2, there
are 3 White Knights.
They are very fast
and maneuverable.
At Generator 3 there
is a large Gear and a
White Knight.
Be careful, the large
Gear has some kind of
special attack.
At Generator 4, there
is a large Gear and a
White Knight.
The large Gear seems to
be a power Gear."

Citan

Dont' worry, it will
soon pass.
But..."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Then, could this
be...?"

Jessie
"The Gears' response
circuits are acting strange
because of a strong shock.
Don't worry, it's
only momentary."

Nikolai
"That much time is enough
to erase you from the face
of the earth."

"Humans are an imperfect,
foolish life form...
I will show the greatness
of a perfect life form!

of human wisdom and the
strength of steel."

There'll be no aging and

I wanted him to be by my
side forever!!"

stupid humans can be.
You don't need to perish
along with these feeble
humans. Now, come, Maria.
Start a new life with me.
We shall begin a new
chapter in life. Let's
build a bright future
together.
I'll be by your side and

I'm going to release
your Graviton Cannon
from its seal by
remote control!
Use that to
defeat me."

Maria
"!! Father!
Have you come
to your senses!?
No!
I can't do it!!
The Graviton Cannon...
you yourself had it
sealed up because of
its destructive power.
Father, if I use
that on you..."

Nikolai
"Fire!! It doesn't
matter... I, Nikolai,
no longer exist...
Before I was brain-
washed by Solaris, I
implanted a conscience
circuit in Achtzehn...
This would respond and
activate in the presence
of Seibzehn. My message
is coming from there.
And, during the battle,
I transferred all my
data from there to
Seibzehn.
I may have lost my body,
but my spirit is with
Seibzehn, no, with you,
Maria. Now and forever!"

I can't bring
myself to do it!!

"Thank you, everyone.
The generator is repaired
and the gate is developing
as usual.
And Maria...
You did very well.
It is very regretful
about Dr. Nikolai...
Solaris put the doctor
through all of that.
We must defeat them as
soon as possible and
restore freedom!"

Maria
"...
Yes."

Fei
"Queen Zephyr, we will
also fight to bring
down Solaris.
To begin with, where
is Solaris?
How do you get there?"

Zephyr
"Solaris is hidden from
human eyes by three
gates.
One of the gates is under
the 'Ethos' H.Q. but...
It is unreachable, even
with Gears.
I don't know where the
other two are yet.
Until we destroy the 3
gates, the path to Solaris
will not open.
In addition we've received
some disturbing news.
Aveh has invaded Nisan."

Bart
"What the...?
Shakhan?"

Zephyr
"Their target is probably
somewhere in the earth.
The secret royal
treasure of Aveh.
An Omnigear, sealed up
by Roni Fatima!"

Bart
"Damn!!
This is no place
to hesitate!
I'm going to Nisan!
We can't let Shakhan
have his way!"

Fei
"I see.
I can't leave Nisan
to its fate.
Okay, first let's
head to Nisan!"

Zephyr
"Your ship has been
equipped with an
aerial module.
Originally it was the
ship used by Bart's
ancestor Roni.
Make free use of it."

Maria
"Umm...
Can you take me along
with you?" (*line is cut here)
I hate just sitting here,
waiting patiently.
I want to do something...
Take me and Seibzehn!"

Zephyr
"I have one request.
Fei, take Maria along
with you.
This child, since her youth
has been destined with no
choice but to fight.
Until she settles her own
fights, she will not be
able move on with her life.
Go Maria, 
and find your purpose in
life...on your own."

Fei
"I got it.
Let's go together,
Maria.
We're friends from
now on, 
you and...
you and Seibzehn too."

Maria
"Yes."

Became friends
with Maria!

Zephyr
"One of the sages,
Gaspar, has returned.
Gaspar is the one who
taught martial arts to
Kahn and Wiseman.
I'm sure he will be able
to teach you new techniques
that will be of help to
you on your journey.
I've already told Gaspar.
Before you leave you should
learn from him."

What about Balthasar,
or Melchior...?"

Gaspar
"No, I haven't seen
them ever since...
Besides, your Majesty...
I came here to watch
over them so that they
do not make the same
foolish mistakes again."

Man
Your Majesty, the Omnigear
underground is moving!!
The girl named Elly was
nearby and it reacted to
her!!

Zephyr
"Just as I thought..."

Wiseman
"It's a matter of course.
But the girl doesn't 
intend to ride it...
Just like 'her'.
She knows it
unconsciously. The
existence within
her..."

Zephyr
"She...was the same as
Sophia?"

Wiseman
"..."

Zephyr
"...Sorry."

Wiseman
"No, I don't mind.
I'm not 'him'."

Gaspar
"Well then, I'll go take
a look at their Limiters."

————————————————————————————

Fei and the guys had
Gaspar remove a part of
the Limiter inserted in
their genes.

Yes yes, and then...
Chu-Chu and her friends
got together and rejoiced
over their safety...
It was natural for them
to have a party, and their
sweet, dangerous night
went on and on...
