Fei
"Doc Uzuki's house
is over the bridge
and up to the north."

Young Boy
Oh, it's you Fei!!

The cliff's edge collapsed from
the heavy rain we had recently.
You're alright Fei, you can do
a big jump to get across it...
But I'm too scared...
    Hey, what's a big jump?
    It's easy, watch me!!

How could you forget...?
A big jump is done by
pressing the <T> button
while running with the
<C> button held down.
You can jump much further
than with a regular jump.
...Fei, you never have
any problems.
It's not fair.

Say hello to the
Doctor for me!

That'a boy Fei...!
Champion of the 12th Lahan
Village Jumping Tournament!

Found a bird nest!!

Take the egg?
    Of course!!
    No, that's cruel!

Received a nutritious
    'bird egg'!!

Cheep, cheep!!!
(Return the egg!!)
    OK, I give it back!!
    No way, never!!

Fei
"Ouch!
Sorry, I'll
give it back!"

Cheep, cheep, cheep!
(Good! You got the hint!)

No way!

Caught a 'spider'!

This way: Walking course.
  Watch out for the cliffs!!
That way: Doctor's house.
  ...Right after the bridge.

This way to Doctor
Citan Uzuki's house!

Fei
"Alright!
Let's go!"
