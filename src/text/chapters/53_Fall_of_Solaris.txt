Jessie
"What took you so long!?
I've only got so many
bullets!
Hurry up and
blow them away!"

Citan
"I am sorry.
I have other matters
to attend to."

Jessie
"...
What the hell are
you doing?"

Citan
"To His Majesty's..."

Jessie
"You mean the Emperor...?
Are you sure, Hyuga...?

Citan
"Yes. His Majesty
understands the situation.
...He says to leave it up
to 'them'..."

Citan
"There! It is done!!
Sir!!"

Jessie
"...Yeessss!
We're outta here!!
...Huh!?"

Ramsus
"Where is he...?
Hyuga..."

Citan
"...Kahr...?"

Ramsus
"So...you too...
you are also
betraying me."

Citan
"Kahr, we are just in
different situations.
I did not mean to
betray you.
I decided to stick
with Fei's group."

Ramsus
"Did you say 'Fei'!?
You too...are on his
side...I'll never forgive
you! NEVER!"

Jessie
"Kahr, you're an enemy
but why are you so 
attached to one kid!?
You weren't like that 
before!"

Ramsus
"Shut up!
I've got to get him with
my own hands...
And all of you working
with him are my enemies!
Enemies stealing 'my 
things'! Enemies!
Enemies, Enemies!!"

Citan
"K, Kahr..."

Jessie
"Hey, we're going!
I don't know what went on,
but I don't have time to 
deal with him now!"

Citan
"But..."

Jessie
"Hyuga!!"

Citan
"...I see..."

Ramsus
"You, traitors!!"

"Oh, that's Fei!!
Fei's Kim is here!!"

Elly
"Father!
Mother!"

Medena
"Elly!!"

Rico
"You should thank Hammer!
Hammer got your parents
at the right time.
Right, Hammer!?"

Hammer
"Y, yes...
Yes...exactly..."

Elly
"T, thank you, Hammer."

Erich
"We'd like to thank you,
too. I never thought I'd 
see my daughter again...
Thank you, Hammer."

Citan
"Listen everyone, we have 
no time to waste."

Citan
"So that we do not stand
out, we should split up
into two groups.
Fei, you have done a lot,
but I would like to have
you move on ahead and take
two more members with you.
Move along southwest of
here and cross two mobile
contact bridges.
There you will find a
hangar that will lead to
the outside.
We will meet at the
footbridge near there.
If you talk to the blue
memory cubes you will be
able to make contact with
the other party members.
You can thus change which
members you wish to have
in your current party."

Jessie
"I shut down alarms here
and there when I was 
breaking gates.
But it's still dangerous.
Be careful!"

Erich
"I'll go to the hangar
beforehand, and arrange
a ride for us.
Solaris is in confusion
now, so if I go alone I 
can pull some strings."

Citan
"...Okay.
Please do not overdo it."

Erich
"Yeah, I know."

Erich
"Elly, Medena...
See you again."

Medena
"Dear...
Please be careful..."

Elly
"Father..."

————————————————————————————

Elly
"I have to get my mother
and father to a safe
place quickly...!"

Medena
"Fei,
now we're in the same
boat as you."

Erich
"Fei, now we're the 
same as you."

Jessie
"This country wasn't like 
this long ago...I think...
Well, maybe I was just too 
young."

Citan
"Fei, let us hurry!!
They will find us
here easily!"

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Let's bail while
we can!"

Billy
"Don't let down your
guard until it's over.
We must get back!!"

Rico
"Those morons in Solaris...
Hope they've learned 
their lesson."

Emeralda
"Fei's Kim,
let's go together!
Let's go!"

Chu-Chu
"I'm not in giant form
so it leaves something 
chu be desired."

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"H, h, hurry, run away...
Yeah, run away.
Yeah, that's right!"

Better make proper
preparations before
you flee, so...
Consider this Hammer's
last closing down sale!
     Items!
     Accessories!

"Even if we make it back
home...will Prim and her
friends be safe?"

Elly
"I'm so glad...
everybody is safe and
sound...
What about my father...?"

Medena
"Saying good-bye to
Solaris...is hard...
This is my home no 
matter what..."

Bart
"I guess we're almost
there."

Emeralda
"Exit! Exit! Exit!"

Chu-Chu
"Whew,
the sky is blue..."

Jessie
"This is the last of the
last. Don't let your
guard down yet!"

"The hangar is just 
over there."

Rico
"All right!
Almost there, Hammer!"

I came all the way..."

Hammer
"St...stop!!!"

Hammer
"I'm asking Miss Elly
to return with me!!"

Elly
"W...what are you doing?
Hammer?"

Hammer
"Don't move!
I'm serious!!"

Fei
"Don't be silly!
What happened? Hammer!?"

Hammer
"I promised to a man named
K...Krelian.
He won't 'change it' if
Miss Elly is returned..."

Rico
"Hammer!! Damn you!!!"

Hammer
"I really don't want to do
this to Miss Elly either.
Really, I like her very
much.
But, but I...
I...
have no other choice!
Because I'm no good...
I don't have the strength
like bro, or the smarts
like the doc!"

Hammer
"I, I know...everyone
thinks of me as some
annoying handyman
who talks too much...
I know that..."

Rico
"Hammer..."

Hammer
"I'm different from you all!
I'm not special like you!
A 'normal' guy like me has
no choice but to do this!!"

Hammer
"D...don't move!!
Stop! Stop!

Medena
"I won't stop.
Ever.
...My child is in danger...
and I'm her mother!!"

Hammer
"...Hya..."

Medena
"I was born and raised in
a normal family.
I'm not a soldier like my
husband and daughter.
I never touched a gun
before,
much less have one
pointed at me...
That's why I'm shaking...
But I can't stop it.
I'm a 'normal' mother.
So there are things I must
protect..."

Medena
"Elly, slowly
come here.
Don't worry. I'll protect
you no matter what."

Elly
"M...mother..."

Medena
"Elly,
come here. It's alright."

Hammer
"...No!
Don't move! No! No!"

Medena
"It's alright, Elly."

Elly
"Fei!"

Hammer
"...No!!
Don't go! No...no...!"

Hammer
"...Don't...
Don't go...don't..."

Elly
"Mother!?"

child..."

Erich
"G, gha!"

Erich
"E...Elly...
Go...now...
Elly, no matter what
happens, believe in
yourself and go on.
We'll be happy to help
anyway we can.
That's the least I can do
to make it up to you...
Elly...
You're Medena's daughter,
my daughter, no matter
what. So..."

Elly
"Father!!"

Executioner
"Oh, have I over done it?
You had no time to say
good bye. But, don't worry.
I'll let you meet again on
the other side..."

Elly
".........
How could you do that...
...to my father!"

Executioner
"...To have that much Ether
control in a non-awakened
state. Impressive.
However..."

Krelian
"There he was..."

Executioner
"Yes, it's clear.
It's nothing like the
half-assed stuff we've
dealt with before."

Miang
"I don't think he'll
get off the stage
easily this time. 
Fei's mental energy
seems to have been
weakened and...
it's similar to 
'the old days'
now..."

Miang
"Ha, ha..."

Krelian
"What's so amusing?"

Miang
"His feelings haven't
changed over the years.
Maybe you have mixed
feelings?"

Krelian
"Hmph, dont' be stupid.
By the way...
what about Ramsus?"

Miang
"You want him to bring
her back? Too late.
Kahr has left already."

Krelian
"I really want to say
it's a waste of time...
but, I guess it's alright.
He probably made it easier
to control it...
Nevertheless..."

Miang
"What?"

Krelian
"How can you continue
to fight without a chance
of winning..."

Miang
"Isn't that what you want?
Though I induced you to
feel that way...
But, we're almost there.
Our only actual example
of success. Let's take
good care of him."

Krelian
"What her true intentions
are...I don't even know."

Krelian
"We're going.
This place will
soon be gone."

Miang
"I agree. We should do
Kahr a favor and save
him... shouldn't we?"

Elly!
Are you OK? Elly!

Citan
"Elly?
Have you come to
your senses yet?"

we were thrown out into
the sky.
The rest of my crew were
aleady picked up and
they're in the Yggdrasil
right now."

Elly
"Oh...
...
...Fei...?
What about Fei?
...
Is he on the Yggdrasil
too?"

Elly
"Solaris!!
...That red Gear!?
What is going on,
Citan?
What's happened to Fei?"

Citan
"Calm down, Elly.
Fei...is alright."

Elly
"So he's already in the
Yggdrasil, right...
Maria?"

Citan
"Calm down, Elly. Listen!
Fei is riding in that Gear.
That Gear is actually
Weltall in its true
form after transformation."

Elly
"What!!"

Citan
"Another Fei within him
has awakened.
Fei and Id are the
same person..."

Elly
"!?
You're kidding!?
I don't believe that!"

We saw it with our own
eyes. The very sight of
him turning into Id..."
