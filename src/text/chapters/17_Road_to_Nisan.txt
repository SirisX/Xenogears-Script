Stuffed Animal
It's lukewarm...

Bart
"That Margie...!
Leaving a strange stuffed
animal in a place like
this! Because of this, we
can't get into the bridge."

Chu-Chu
It's not strange!

Bart
"Hey, Fei!!
Stop the funny
voices, will ya!?"

Fei
"Huh? 
I didn't say anything."

Bart
"...
That's weird...
Anyway, let's ask
Margie to get rid
of it."

Bart
"Hey, Margie!
Get rid of that strange
stuffed animal sitting
in front of the bridge.
It's in our way."

Margie
"It's not a 'strange
stuffed animal'!
It has a name.
Its name is..."

Margie
"Her name is Chu-Chu!"

Margie
"But, that's weird.
It was just here, where I
put it, a moment ago..."

Chu-Chu
Nice chu meet chu!!
I'm Chu-Chu!
I fell in love with you
when I first saw you in
Bledavik!! Wherever you
go, I shall go chu!

Oh my...
I just declared
my love!!

Bart
"What we thought was just
a stuffed toy is actually
a living animal! Weird!"

Margie
"No wonder it felt
strangely lukewarm!"

Fei
"Wha, What!?"

Bart
"Looking good, Fei!!"

Fei
"Shut up!!"

Bart
"It's all right.
I, as the captain, give
you my permission!"

Chu-Chu
"Yeah, yeah!"

Fei
"...
Suit yourself!"

Bart
"Ha, ha, ha!
Well, I don't want
to interrupt you two,
so I'll wait outside!"

Margie
"..."

Margie
"Thank you for your help
at the castle.
I heard you really riled
it up at the tournament.
Bart was bragging how
you're both buddies and
all."

Fei
"...
Re...really?"

Margie
"I'm so ashamed...
I want to be of help
to Bart but I ended
up owing him again."

Margie
"Fei, have you seen Bart's
back?
He's got scars all over
his back and it looks so
painful.
Long ago, when the two of
us got caught by Shakhan,
Bart protected me from
getting beaten..."

Margie
"At that time, I decided
to be his follower...to
serve and protect him!
But, he is the one who's
always protecting me..."

Fei
"..."

Margie
"Uh, oh, so sorry...
Anyway, thanks a lot
for saving me!"

Maison
"...sob...sob...
Oh to think that Marguerite
has now returned...
Come to think of it, this
is the second time we have
had to flee from the Royal
Capital.
It seems an awful long
time ago...
That night that I took
them with me to escape..."

Bart
"Yeah and on top of that he
was bold enough to steal
this ship along the way.
You know this used to be
the kingdom's flagship?"

Maison
"Yes, it was all Sigurd's
doing. So courageous of him
even at such a young age.
Anyway, this Yggdrasil can
be considered as a keepsake
of the late king for the
young master."

Bart
"It kinda feels like you're
stuck to me for life.
Even though you used to be
my personal knight, right?
Now I'm just a kid pirate!"

Maison
"But eventually you will
become a proud lord."

Bart
"I gotta hurry up and
grow up or I'll never
be proud of myself.
And I won't be able
to win against him!"

Maison
"..."

Marguerite's become

last time I saw her.
She is indeed the
true Great Mother
of Nisan.

Hey?
That professor dressed
in green isn't with you?

Sigurd
"Young master, according to
Margie, there's quite a
troublemaker in Gebler."

Bart
"Yeah...
So, who the heck is he?"

Sigurd
"Kahran Ramsus of the Holy
Solaris Empire's Special
Foreign Affairs Agency...
In other words, he's the
commander in chief of
Gebler.
It seems that Gebler isn't
just after the excavation
sites around Aveh after
all."

Bart
"You mean, they're not
after the Jasper?"

Sigurd
"If that's their only goal
they wouldn't need to send
an important man like him!
Young master, this could
become unexpectedly
complicated..."

Fei
"Doc hasn't come
back yet, has he?"

Sigurd
...

Sigurd
"Hyu... I mean, 'doc'...
No need to worry about him.
He'll join us soon."

Sigurd
"We shall have to enter
into Nisan through the
secret road.
Let's keep on the lookout
for a lone tree in the
desert as a sign of where
the road lies buried...!"

Sigurd
"Shall we launch
the Yggdrasil?"
    Go ahead!
    Wait a while.

Sigurd
"...
Now I see why you came
down to the surface...
Alright, I understand you.
But Kahran Ramsus...
taking over the post of
Aveh is pretty annoying."

Citan
"The home country
might have had some
special reasons."

Sigurd
"Yeah...
obviously."

Citan
"But perhaps there is still
a chance of success...
You and I, who used to be
called 'Elements' at the
commander's training school
'Jugend', are both here!"

Sigurd
"Hope you are right..."

Citan
"By the way, 
she is still...?"

Sigurd
"According to Fei,
there was a female aide
on Kahr's side...
And he said that she had
Indigo blue eyes and hair.
... 
So it must be her..."

Citan
"So all the old 'Elements'
members are on the surface
world now..."

Sigurd
"I guess so..."

Sigurd
"Hyuga...
To be honest with you...
she scares me.
She supports Kahr and
is kind to anyone, 
I know that very well.
But sometimes I felt
a strange fear in her.
That bothers me more than
Kahr being in this land."

Citan
"That cannot be true...
Not in her..."

Sigurd
"Yeah, I don't want to 
believe it, either...
But don't you remember how
I could always sense these
things quite accurately?"

Citan
"Right..."

Citan
"By the way, have you told
the young one yet...?"

Sigurd
"No, not yet.
I don't want him to worry
until we know exactly what
Solaris' objectives really
are.
But I have to tell him 
eventually though...
Anyway, Hyuga, have you
gotten any information?"

Citan
"Not really....
I left there before going
into the center section..."

Bart
(Fei!!)

Fei
(Oh, it's you Bart!?
Don't scare me...!)

Bart
(Sorry-dorry.
It sounds like Sig and your
doctor friend know each
other pretty darn well...
Sig...
Damn, I thought I knew
everything about that
guy!)

Fei
(When did doc get back..?)

Sigurd
"I'll complete the
remaining checks
onboard.
I'll leave the
rest up to you,
Maison."

Maison
"As you wish...
I will have the honor of
accompanying the others."

Nisan Man
Bartholomew, healthy
as ever I hope?

Bart
"Yeah.
How's the town?"

Nisan Man
Since we got word several
days ago that there might
be an army advancing from
the Royal Capital the
Sect's representatives
have been in discussion.

Bart
"What have they
come up with?"

Nisan Man
For now, they just plan to
improve the local defenses.
Also, anti-Shakhan people
have been gathering here...
probably because they heard
about what's going on.

Bart
"That's reassuring."

Nisan Man
Yes.
However the residents are
starting to feel uneasy.
People are starting to
take refuge up north
in the mountains.

Bart
"Can't blame them."

Nisan Man
By the way, how's 
Marguerite...?

Bart
"Better than we thought.
But I know she was in a
lot of grief."

Nisan Man
Marguerite!
I'm so glad
you're safe.

Margie
"Thanks."

Nisan Man
All the townspeople are
overjoyed by the Great
Mother's return.
