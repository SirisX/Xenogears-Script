(...hey...
It's me...me. 
Ready to go?

Solaris 3rd Class Entry Room - 1630

Samson
"From here on, it'll
be better if we split up.
It's a maze so be careful."

Fei
"Yeah, you too..."

Elly
"Are we really going to
be okay?"

————————————————————————————
Solaris 3rd Class Level Scanning Gate - 1632
————————————————————————————

Samson
"Not bad. I think I'll
let myself go on ahead!"

Elly
"Wait! 
You're not a Gazel! 
What're you going to do?"

Samson
"Not a problem. I used 
undergound tech to
re-write my ID."

Elly (*???add*)
...

>>>ID error. (*???change ]]] to >>>)
Eliminate.

Fei (*???add*)
Samson!!

Samson (*???add*)
W, wait!!
Ughaaaaaahhh!

Fei (*???add*)
!!

...

Fei
"Damn you!!
I'm gonna destroy it!!"

Elly (*???add*)
No!

Fei (*???add*)
Waah!!

Elly
"It's useless to do that.
You won't be able to get
through without either a
1st Class citizen ID or 
a military ID..."

Fei
"Then what're we going
to do...?"

Elly
"Well we can't just stand
here...
I guess it's going to have
to be all or nothing."

Fei
"If it doesn't work out,
we'll worry about it
later...is what you're
saying? Isn't that kinda
sounding like Bart?"

Fei
"How rude. It's not
like I always go in
without a plan."

>>>1st Class citizen, (*???change ]]] to >>>)
Gazel, confirmed. Please
pass through in an
orderly fashion.

Fei
"We can get through!"

Elly
"..."

Fei
"?
What's wrong?"

Elly
"Huh? Uh well... 
I've done so much, I'm
surprised they haven't
labeled me as a
traitor yet..."

Fei
"You think it's because
they haven't reported it?
To the Gebler, it would
be like admitting failure
and all."

Elly
"I hope so..."

Fei
"Anyway, let's go!!"

Elly
"Okay. Oh, stay very
close to me.
That way,
it shouldn't pick up
your presence."

Elly
"Fei, where are you
going?"

Solaris 2nd Class Level - 1662
————————————————————————————

Guard 1
Hey! Why are you coming
out of there!? Come over
here!

Elly
"I'm an Imperial Special
Forces lieutenant,
Elhaym Van Houten.
I have just completed
the collection of the
special levy of the 3rd
Class level.
I am now in the process
of taking this surface
dweller back to HQ.
Any problems with that?"

Guard 1
(G, Gebler!?)

N, no, no problems...
Please, go on.

————————————————————————————

Man 1
The one behind you 
is the Gebler? 
I heard the Lambs destroyed
the gate...
Is everything okay?
    It's okay
    It's questionable

Whew, what a relief.

————————————————————————————

Wha? Now now,
quit jokin'. 
That's impossible!

————————————————————————————

Woman 1
You've got a lot of guts
going into an area full
of those barbarians... 
Only a Gebler could 
do that

Man 2
This is the problem
with government offices
...grumble...grumble...

————————————————————————————
Solaris 2nd Class Main - 1624

Man 1
As a service to citizens,
we now are accepting data
for the marriage service.
The Central Control Bureau
will pick the very best
match for you. 
Our motto is 'Good matches
make good descendants'.
We are the seed that came
from it, so of course we 
are the best.

Woman 1
...
You look rather odd.
3rd Class citizens should
dress more appropriate.

Little Boy 1
Whaddya think of these
Pogoshoes? 
They were made from
the newest technology.
They don't put stress
on your spine, they're
the best.
The Imperial model is a
super cool ultra rare
item.

Guard 1
Danger ahead.

Man 2
You can get whatever
you want here.
Look, I should have lost
this arm in an accident,
but with Solaris' biosampling
Look, no scar.
There are none of the 
crimes, disasters or wars
like on earth.
Science makes everything
possible for us.

Man 3
The Dedication is 
starting soon.

Guard
These are special seats 
for the Dedication. 
Huh? No ticket?
You can't go in...

Elly
"Dedication ceremony...
Solaris is probably not 
doing so well now."

Fei
"Huh? 
Why do we have to watch
this? 
We decided to meet
everyone. We don't have
time to go this
festival."

Elly
"This is no ordinary 
festival.
The people are disturbed
by the gate's
disappearance.
The dedication is probably
to quell the masses.
We must check Solaris'
stance against land 
dwellers.
Fei, 
we need to get tickets."

Fei
"Yeah? 
I guess we have to get 
some info on the enemy..."

Elly
"Hurry up. 
There's not much time 
till the Dedication."

Son
Wow, you got me that
Battling Alloy!! 
When I grow up I'm gonna
join Gebler too!
 
Father
My son bugged me so 
much I just had to get
him a Hybrid Alloy.
I'll be so proud if joins
Gebler when he grows up.

Clerk 1
Which one?

Man 1
...

I'm so indecisive, 
I don't know what to buy. 
Don't bother me.

Woman 1
There's so many Imperial
models out now.
It's a limited edition, 
so I gotta buy it!"

Clerk 2
This is Ticketmeister.
What are you looking for?
    Tickets
    Buy and sell
    Nothing

VIP seating for the 
Dedication is all sold 
out. Please enjoy
it on Homevision.

————————————————————————————
-OPTION 2-

We're giving out 
Dedication tickets. 
Please come to Room 21 
in Etren Court.

————————————————————————————

Little Boy
What? They don't have any
Imperial model pogoshoes?
I want them so badly too!

Clerk 3
Sir, I'm sorry. We just
sold the last pair.

Little Boy
Waagghh!!

Little Girl
I want the Imperial 
model too!!

Little Boy
This 'Imperial model' is
pretty nice!

Fei ???
"Doesn't that say 
'Impaired Model'?"

Little Boy
Huh?
Wow, it does! 
It must be a fake!

Woman 2
Hmm, what should I do...
What do you think?
    What about this one?
    How about that one?

You think so? 
But you like weird 
clothes too so...
I'll take that one!

————————————————————————————

Hmmm, really?
I'm getting more and
more lost...

————————————————————————————

Woman 3
Service in Solaris is 
great, no matter how big
something is, it's always
there when you get home.

Image of Woman Inside Tube (*???Added*)
...
I've seen that 
somewhere before...

Man 2
There seems to be a big 
struggle on the surface.
But it has absolutely 
nothing to do with us.
As long as the Emperor is
with us, we can live in
peace. 
Jumping out of a frying
pan just might land you
in the fire...
That stupid Ramsus hasn't
learned that yet.

Man 3
Just looking down and
seeing the earth I think...
Those poor souls can't
live in this fine city.
Even if they destroy the
gate, it's all a waste
of effort...
Futile resistance from 
those who will never
reach our paradise.

Man 4
The Emperor will give 
the speech himself.
He can't stand to see our 
confusion anymore so he 
went out of the way to 
make an appearance.
We should be thankful.

Father
You can't buy real plants
unless you're a 1st Class
citizen. 
...sigh...I'm so jealous.

Little Girl
This Alloy Imperial Gear
dad bought me is so cool!
It really flies!!

Wow!

Man
Even Solaris' advanced
science can't halt aging.
But they say the powerful
have overcome it...
They already have great
descendants, what more do
they want?
Don't you agree?

Woman
I came to see the Emperor,
and strained my back...
They can cure almost
anything but a bad back.
And after putting up with
all that to get tickets...

Hey, you kids.
Need tickets to the Dedication?
Kids like you really should
go see it!
    Please
    No thanks

Received Dedication tickets.

Forget the money. Just
hurry or you'll miss it.
I'm going to watch it
on Homevision.

————————————————————————————
-OPTION 2-

Woman
Weird kids...
Better take them before
I change my mind.
You can't get them at
Ticketmeister.

————————————————————————————
???

Woman
Huh? You're the kids
I gave the tickets to!
You're still here? You're
gonna miss the Dedication!
————————————————————————————
-AFTER- Going to the Dedication

Woman???
How was the Dedication? 
It must have been a lot
better from the VIP seats.

Man
Go and save on that
memory cube.
You can rest easy if you 
send your data to the
Central Control Bureau
regularly.
I've heard they're
lying around on the
ground in places for
data collecting.

Are you Etrenstrolling? 
What? Etrenstrolling
is walking along the 
Etrenank. 
You need to download the
Etren Guide to do it.
Central Control always
has fun things.
It's their job to keep 
the citizens happy.

Little Boy
Yaay! The Emperor!

Woman 2
You have a ticket? 
You'd better hurry to 
make it on time!

Guard
You have a ticket. 
Alright, go on through. 
Better hurry or you won't
make it in time.

	Emperor Cain (*???add*)
     My beloved children, you
     can be at ease. The Gazel
     Ministry and I planned
     the destruction of the
     gate long ago.
     The people chosen by god...
     we, the Gazel, will return
     to god's paradise. To the
     sleeping mother god...
     The time for our
     immortality has come.
     We have opened the the door
     to 'Mahanon'...the place
     where god rests, the source
     of wisdom and power. The
     surface dwellers will no
     doubt use this opportunity
     to seize its power.
     However, there is no need
     to be concerned...
     As long as Solaris has
     this power...

Hey, Elly!"

Elly
"Sorry...
Did you say something?"

Fei
"'Did I say something?'?
Are you okay?
You're zoning. 
Your mind's not here."

Elly

I was just thinking.
And this crowd's noisy."
