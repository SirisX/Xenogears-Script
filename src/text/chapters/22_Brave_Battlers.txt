Hammer
"Huff, huff, huff...
I just finished
signing you up!"

Fei
"Gee...that was quick!
Is it really that easy?"

Hammer
"Normally it isn't so easy!
But a woman called Rue from
the Battling Committee seems
to have done some pushing
and pulling on your behalf!"

Fei
"The Battling Committee...?
Oh, you mean those three?"

Hammer
"Well anyway, thanks to
them, the enrolling process
went like a breeze!
Hey hey! This means you can
start Battling whenever you
want to, bro!"

Fei
"But besides that, Hammer,
since yesterday, you've
seemed a little too happy!
Is there something strange
going on behind the scenes
that I don't know about?"

Hammer
"...Huh?
N,n,no! N,nothing! 
N,n,nothing at all!
The mechanic of champions,
me, has had his sins wiped
clean so there is nothing
to be suspect of! Hahaha!"

Fei
"Hmm, really?"

Hammer
"What do you mean?
I told you there is 
nothing at all!
Oooh! 
I've got a lot to do, so 
I'll go on ahead of you!"

Fei
"Oh...!
Hey...!
W,w,wait...!" 

Fei
"What are you up to.
Not saying where
you're going to..."

Hammer
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
The Battling Arena is on 
the outskirts of D-Block.
Talk to the guard and he 
should let you pass. Bye!"

Fei
"...
The outskirts of D-Block?"

Citan
"Fei!
Hold on a second!"

Fei
"What is it doc?
Last night you said we
should act separately..."

Citan
"Yes I know I did.
But there is something 
that I am curious about!
I shall join you in going
to the Battling Arena.
Is it not too late to
split up after that?"

Fei
"...? Well...whatever!
Anyway, let's get going!"

Guard
"Hey, you...huh?
Oh it's you!
I heard from the Imperial
Battling Committee...
I can let you thru, but as
long as you have that bomb
collar on it's no use
trying to escape...!
If you don't wanna die,
stay away from the off-
limit areas, such as the
civilian section, okay!?"

Fei
"...So this is the
Battling Arena."

Citan
"...Or the reception
area to be exact."

Fei
"...Hmn!?"

Rue
"Welcome to the Battling
Arena...
Fei, Sir...
Several days ago you were
adamant about not piloting
Gears...
Has something happened in 
the last few days to make
you change your mind in
such a large way?"

Fei
"Well, I have my reasons.
For starters, you can't say 
prison life is that easy."

Fei
"...And then there's the 
matter of personal safety!"

Subordinate
"???"

Subordinate
"???"

Fei
"Then there's this collar!
It gets in the way so much!"

Rue
"Your collar...?"

Rue
"Hahahmm...
You're amusing!
Are you intending to aim for
victory despite it being 
your first try at Battling?"

Fei
"...Is that strange?"

Rue
"No, no! Not the least...
Please excuse me!
You seem to have quite some
confidence in fighting with
Gears...
I'm looking forward to..."

!?

Rue
"Oops...excuse me!
Well, I guess I'll show you
the way to the paddocks.
We don't have much time..."

Fei
"The paddocks...?"

Rue
"What, you're thinking that
you're going to fight with
flesh and blood?
...Hahahmm, not that I 
wouldn't mind seeing it, 
but..."

Rue
"We told you before that
the committee would prepare
a machine for you...
What did you forget?"

Fei
"Oh, err...
The Gear I'm going to pilot
will be, err..."

Rue
"Well, come on now.
Walk this way..."

Citan
"Hold on! We are not
ready yet... Can you
spare us a little time?"

Rue
"...Understood. But we don't
have much time to spare, so
please hurry up now..."

Informationist
"Nothing learned nothing 
gained. Ask and you shall
receive...perhaps.
Anyway, 'Battler', what do
you need to know about the
Battling Contest?"

Informationist
"What shall I explain?"
    What's Battling?
    Basic controls
    I'm alright thanks!

Informationist
"Okeydokey!
Well then, I'll now explain
a bit about 'Battling'."

Informationist
"Battling is the sport of
fighting one-on-one with
Gears and is held at the 
Imperial Capital's arena.
The format of the sport is
simple - fight until one or
the other breaks down. 
In other words, just bash
your rival to pieces!
But you don't have to fight
till you trash your Gear.
You are allowed to give up
during a match...so if you
can't win...well, you know!
Finally, the armor values
of Gears during the battling
bouts are made uniform, so
that competitors can fight
on equal terms.
In other words, competitors
must rely fully on the
fundamental properties
of the Gears they pilot."

Informationist
"Well that's the quick
rundown...I think.
Did you get the drift?

Fei
"Well, errh..."
    Sure, no problem!
    Sorry I don't get it!

Informationist
"The next thing to do is to
gain experience by actually
Battling. The key is to
get used to the controls!
But perhaps jumping straight
into an actual battle is too
much for you? Well then, why
not try our 'practice mode'
for help with the controls?
This is a simulation mode
where you can practice the
basic control methods.
We recommend that beginners
should train here first!
Also, there is a 'tutorial
mode' that provides easy 
lessons, from the basic 
controls through to an 
explanation of the screen."

Informationist
"Is there anything else you
want to ask about?"

————————————————————————————

Informationist
"Huh? You didn't understand?
That's strange! Well, once
again from the beginning...
(Gee and I thought this guy
had it in him? ...Obviously I
was wrong... Is his head OK?)
Anyway, listen closely now!"

————————————————————————————

Informationist
"What shall I explain?"
    Battling
    Basic controls
    I'm alright thanks!
	
————————————————————————————

Informationist
"Right, the basic controls!
Well what do you want to do?
    Ask about button controls
    Tutorial Mode
    Practice Mode
    Ask about something else

Informationist
"Right, the button controls.
I'll explain each button's
function accordingly...

Informationist
"Well, I'll now explain the
basic control methods using
the actual screen."

Informationist
"So, you want to try out the
actual controls, huh..."

Informationist
"Oh, well...have it your way!
What else do you want to
enquire about?"

"Which button do you need
an explanation of?
    Directional button
    <X> button
    <S> button
    <T> button
    <C> button

"Which shall I explain to
you about?"
    L1 button

    Start button
    Back to first page
    End explanation

Informationist
"Oh...had enough already?
Anything else you need to
know? Don't be afraid now!

————————————————————————————

Informationist
"O.K., about the Directional
button... Assuming that your
opponent is on your right
(from your viewpoint) then:
= UP moves your Gear back
 away from the screen.
= DOWN moves your Gear in
 towards the screen.
= RIGHT moves your Gear
 towards your opponent.
= LEFT moves your Gear
 away from your opponent.

Informationist
"Lastly, when you're close
to your opponent, pressing
LEFT invokes a special move
momentary back acceleration!
This momentarily distances
you from your opponent (or
allows you to 'run away')!
Just remember the opposite
direction to your opponent.

Informationist
"That's it in a nutshell!
It's probably easier to get
the idea by actually trying
your hand at the controls!"

Informationist
"The <X> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <X> is one of them.)
It changes from Gear to Gear
but is mainly meant for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three long!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can use!"

Informationist
"The <S> button is ATTACK.
(There are 3 attack buttons
and <S> is one of them.)
It differs from Gear to Gear
but is mainly utilized for
close combat. And you're not
limited to just one blow.
By combining the <X> and <S>
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three in length!
All together there are 14
such combinations that you
can try out!"

Informationist
"The <T> button is for JUMP!
Your movement controls are
the same during jumps.
Also, you are able to attack
with the <X> and <S> buttons
during jumps!
Oh, and it's alright to use
the R1 button to make Ether
Bullet attacks too!

Informationist
"The <C> button is for DASH.
Your movement controls are
the same as usual.
The only thing is that you
cannot continue running
indefinitely."

Informationist
"For more details, try
the 'Tutorial Mode', where
you'll get an explanation 
from a different official."

Informationist
"Attacking isn't everything!
Although it is said that 
'offense is the best form
of defense', at times it is
important to defend oneself.
That's why we have the L1 
button to GUARD you!  But, 
it doesn't prevent all of 
the damage so be careful!"

Informationist
"The R1 button launches a 
special attack called 'Ether 
Bullet'. It's good for long
range attacks on your foe!
'Ether Bullets' have homing
ability so you may tend to
rely on them, but you might
regret it if you use them 
too much! Do be careful!"

Informationist
"For more details, try our 
'Tutorial Mode', where you
will get an explanation from
a different official."

Informationist
"The Start button will
permit you to pause the
battle.
At this time, you may select
the 'GIVE UP' option if you 
think you won't win."

Sorry, but to prevent pilots
from cheating, unauthorized

Hammer
"I'm a mechanic, so I took
the liberty to set up shop
here for a while.
Let's not waste time, bro,
care to to make a purchase?"
    Not now!
    'spose I have to.

Hammer
"Yeah! That's my bro!
You're too kind man!
Much appreciated!"

Hammer
"What you be needin' bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's Gear parts

Hammer
"Thanks bro, but how about
buying something else apart
from items?
It'll help Hammer out too!"
    Enough already!
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"OK, now for the Battling.
Do your best, bro!
For Hammer's future t..."

Hammer
"Forget it!"

Hammer
"The procedures were quite
sudden so the approval for

Oh and bro, you haven't 
been allocated a Gear yet.

will give you...?"

surprise."

Fei
"Doc!?"

Citan
"...Hmmm. I do not think
this is coincidental...
...I am simply assuming,
but they probably
intentionally furnished
you with Weltall to
collect some data."

Fei
"Intentionally?"

Citan
"Battling itself serves
as one of Kislev's plans.
From Battling, they can
obtain the various combat
data...

military."

data could they get outta

the empire is up to,
this is good for us."

Welcome to the Tutorial Mode.
Here you can learn more about
the 'Battling' controls.

Choose a topic to learn about
and press the <X> Button.

Battling is a game where you
fight one-on-one with Gears
in a wide-open, circular
field or arena.
A match ends when either you
or your opponent's Gear takes
too much damage and has its
Durability (H.P.) reach zero.

The game is played on
a screen that displays
the two Gears side on.

This is the Gear you control.
You start the battle on the
left-hand side of the screen.

This is your opponent's Gear.

These are Durability Gauges
that show your damage level.
The top gauge is yours, and
the bottom is your opponent's.
When you attack your opponent,
his Gear's Durability will be
depleted. The Durability in
the gauge cannot be recovered.
The one who deplete's his
opponent's Durability Gauge
(H.P.) to 0 first will become
the match winner.

This is your Heat Gauge.
It indicates the temperature
of your Gear, which is raised
when you use your Dash ability
or fire Ether Bullets.
Your Gear's temperature can
be recovered also, and this
too will be reflected by the
gauge's level.

This is your opponent's
Heat Gauge.

One of these marks will
light up each time you
win a match.
When you win a set number
of matches you will be
awarded the bout's overall
victory.

When you use Ether Bullets or
your Dash ability, your Heat
Gauge will increase. You have
to avoid heating up too much!
The gauge will recover when
you're using normal attacks
or just doing nothing at all.

Even during your normal
running movement it will
slowly drop back down.

If you use your Ether Bullets
and Dash abilities too much,
the rate of heat recovery
won't be able to keep up...
If your Heat Gauge reaches its
limit, your Gear will start to
overheat...

At this point, any further use
of such abilities will damage
your Gear and cause your
Durability (H.P.) to decrease.

When the indicator alongside
of your Heat Gauge is blue,
you can use Ether Bullets and
Dash abilities as per normal.
But, if you use these
abilities while the
indicator is yellow...

your Heat Gauge will exceed
its limit and your Durability
Gauge (H.P.) will decrease.

When the indicator is red,
you have no Durability (H.P.)
left and so cannot fire any
more Ether Bullets.

One strategy is to attack your
opponent as much as you can
while you still have
Durability (H.P.) to spare.

To approach your opponent,
press the Directional Button
towards him/her.
To retreat from your opponent,
press the Directional Button
away from him/her.
Pressing Up / Down on the
Directional Button will move
you away from / towards the
screen respectively.
Push the <T> Button to jump.

Hold down the <C> Button while
moving to Dash. You will run
at twice normal speed, but
your Heat Gauge will rise.
You cannot Dash when your Heat
Gauge is at maximum or when
your Durability (H.P.) Gauge
is low.
Also, your Heat Gauge will not
decrease during the time spent
in the air when you jump while
Dashing.

When you are right in front of
your opponent and you push the
Directional Button away from
him/her...
...you can perform a Back-Dash
(momentary back acceleration).
Use this to instantaneously
dodge your opponent's attacks.

Moving while in desert areas
raises the Heat Gauge faster
than normal. Acceleration is
not as responsive either.

You cannot Dash in the water
areas. Water will also absorb
Ether Bullets, so you cannot
fire while under water.
However, the rate of recovery
of your Heat Gauge is a little
better while your Gear is in
the water.

You can use the <S> and <X>
Buttons to attack.
For example, if you just push
the <S> Button once you will
enter an attack sequence.

If you don't push another
button in the meantime, you
will simply execute the <S>
Button's attack and finish.
Now watch what happens if we
push another attack Button
before the first attack's
movement is completed...
Either the <S> or <X> Buttons
is okay, but here we will try
pushing the <X> Button after
our initial <S> Button attack.
... The <X> Button's attack
will follow immediately after
the <S> Button's attack.

In this way, you can enter up
to three attacks in advance,
and execute them in one swift
sequence.
The type of attack changes
with the number of times
and order that the <S> and
<X> Buttons are pressed.
Try combining the attack
buttons in any order that
you like. For example, <S><X><S>,
<S><S><S>,<X><X><S> and so forth.
In all, there are 14 different
kinds of attack combinations
for you to try out.

You may input up to 3 attacks
before the first attack is
completed.
Among your opponents, there
are Gears that can only attack
up to 2 times in sequence.

For long range attacks, you
can press the R1 Button to
launch an 'Ether Bullet'.

Ether Bullets have the ability
to track the enemy, but will
dissipate upon contact with
such things as walls or water.
For each shot launched, the
Heat Gauge will rise markedly.
If you're not careful, you
may lose all your Durability
(H.P.) by just continually
firing Ether Bullets.
So always keep an eye on
your Heat Gauge, for fear
of losing Durability.

If your opponent fires an
Ether Bullet at you, Dash or
jump to avoid being hit by it.
Also, if you hit your enemy's
back while he/she is fleeing,
you may be able knock him/her
off his feet.

There are times when you can't
dodge your opponent's attack
by simply moving out of the
way.
In those occasions, it is best
to use the L1 Button to guard
against enemy attacks.

If you're about to be hit by
your enemy and you don't think
you can dodge it...
then press the L1 Button to
take a guarding stance.
If you were able to guard
yourself in time, the damage
from your opponent's attack
will be halved.
However, you cannot guard
yourself against attacks
that come from behind you.
It may be difficult to use at
first, but when you get used
to it, guarding will probably
become a useful tactic.

"Doc, I've got to get
back to the Battling.
I want to get this
explosive collar off
of me as soon as I can."

Citan
"Fei, how is your health
holding up? I do not want
you to push yourself..."

Fei
"There's no use saying that.
Time is not going to wait!
I can't just do nothing..."

Citan
"...I suppose you are
right. I understand what you
mean, Fei.
We have got to try and get
out of here as soon as
we possibly can."

Citan
"But that does not mean you
have to over-exert yourself
again, straight away!
Take time to rest up
a little more..."

Fei
"You're the doc, ...doc!
I'll try... and get...
a little more... rest..."

Hammer
"How are you feeling, bro?
All this running backwards
and forwards is killing me!
I know it's a bit sudden but
how about buying something?"
    Not now Hammer!
    I guess I'll have to!

Hammer
"So...maybe not today, but
there's always tomorrow! Buy
something next time, huh!"

Wandering Battler
I'm a wandering Battler. 
This town's now in a tumult
over a sewer monster.
They say that two expert
Battlers got killed!
It seems they were well
known around here too!
And to think, both killed!
Must of been some creature!
Ohh, heaven forbid!

Little Boy
There are rails here.
Occasionaly a train comes
through here!...So
I put a coin here as a test.

Little Girl
Hmmm, according to
my theory the coin should
get bigger...
So, it'll be worth more!

Guard 1
"Hahaha. 
That kid's, at it again.
Do you know the kid's story?
If he squishes that coin
it'll be worthless.
Well, ignorance is bliss......
Besides, he's never been
successful. Gramps always
gets mad at him.
Happens every time..."

Guard 2
"There are no prisoners
locked up in here like you,
who became a Battler in
such a short time.
Hahaha, won't be able to
take my eyes off the match
this year...
Well, good luck.
I'll be rooting for you,
I guess."
