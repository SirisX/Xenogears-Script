Fei
"So this is what doc
was talking about.
Let me see...
what's so interesting
about it..."

Wow!?

Fei
"W, what is this...?"

————————————————————————————
Soundtrack - A Distant Promise
————————————————————————————

Fei
"This music...?
I've heard it before
somewhere...?"

Citan
What do you think?
Not bad, huh?

Fei
"Doc..."

Citan
"Hello again Fei. Sorry
to have kept you waiting."

Citan
"Music is a mysterious
thing...
Sometimes, it makes people
remember things that they
do not expect.
Many thoughts,
feelings, memories...
things almost forgotten...
Regardless of whether
the listener desires to
remember them or not..."

Fei
"Doc, what is this...?"

Citan
"It was excavated from
some old ruins, and is
still under repair.
Obviously it is an audio
device of some type."

Citan
"Long ago people would
listen to this melody,
just as we are doing now...
At times they would have
been cheered up...
While at times they would
have been made to cry."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"By the way, what brings
you here today?"

Fei
"Oh yeah, that's right!
Alice asked me to borrow
some camera equipment
from you."

Citan
"Oh yes.
Her wedding is
tomorrow, right...?"

Citan
"Understood.
Well, we had better
get them ready then."

Citan
"Oh, and dinner should be
ready soon. Would you like
to join us?"

Fei
"Would I ever!
I was hoping
you would ask."

Citan
"I still have some
cleaning up to do
out here.
Would you mind giving
Midori some company
back in the house?"

Fei
"Okay.
Take your time, doc.
I'll go ahead and eat
when dinner is ready!"

Citan
"Ha, ha, ha.
Go right ahead.
But, I will not be held
responsible if you get a
stomachache from eating
my wife Yui's cooking."

Fei
"Doc...
I feel strange when I
listen to this music...
I feel something warm
inside..."

Citan
"That just may be because
you have someone living
inside of you...
... And he too must have
liked this music a long
time ago before he became
a part of you...

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Is Timothy and Alice's
wedding really tomorrow...
It might actually be
better to live an ordinary
life, in this condition...
As a son of man..."

Citan
"Well, anyway. I suppose
I had better adjust the
gyro at least..."

Citan
"Huh....!?"

Citan
"This cannot be...
Is...is this...
an omen...?"

Citan
"...
Now, what is going
to happen...?"

Fei
"Mmmm!
That was good!"

Fei
"Your cooking never
fails to impress me,
Yui!"

Fei
"Thank you for such
a delicious meal!"

Yui
"You're welcome.
If you like my cooking
that much, then I'd be
happy to cook for you
anytime, Fei!"

Yui
"Oh, and the bread tasted
really good because I used
that egg you brought us."

Fei gained a bit of weight,
but felt he did a bad thing.
... Well, just a little bit!

Citan
"I will bring the equipment
you need to the village
tomorrow morning, myself...
It does not exactly make me
feel comfortable to have
you handle such delicate
instruments, I am afraid!"

Fei
"...
Where have I heard
that line before!?"

Fei
"That's alright by me...
Well, see you tomorrow, doc!
Good night, Yui, Midori!"

Yui
"Good night.
We're looking forward
to tomorrow's wedding."

Midori
"..."

Yui
"I wonder what happened...?
Be careful now, Fei!"

Fei
"Well,
good night, doc."

Citan
"Yes, good night."

Citan
"Oh, Fei!
Please be careful..."

Citan
"Ah, I mean...
the path is dangerous
when it is so dark..."

Fei
"What's wrong, doc?
There is nothing to worry
about! Well, anyway, I'll
see you tomorrow."

Citan
"Good night, Fei.
And do be careful!"

!?

Fei
"What's that...?"

Fei
"Giants...?"

Citan
Fei!!

Fei
"Doc!
Some flying objects
went toward Lahan!!"

Citan
"So you saw them too!
Judging by their shadows,
they appear to be a group
of Gears from our neighbor
country, Kislev."

Fei
"Those were...
Gears...?"

Citan
"!!
Oh no! They are headed
directly for Lahan!"

Fei
"The ones I just saw?"

Citan
"Let us make haste!"

Fei
"Right!"
