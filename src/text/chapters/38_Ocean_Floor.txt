Captain
"Oh, Citan.
You came because
you were worried?"

Citan
"Yes, you could say that.
But you seem to be better
off than I expected."

Captain
"Of course."

We are

Men!

of the Sea!!

Captain
"...Is what I'd like to
say...
...but the truth is the
situation's been pretty
bad.
We've got some that are
injured badly and some
that are fatal.
But considering what
happened to the other
ships, we're in no position
to complain.
And by the way, Citan. What
the hell is up with that
fishbowl thing?
It came out of nowhere and
kicked our butts and left
behind Wels.
And then, it headed for
some obscure excavation
site where there's supposed
to be nothing.
Odd, since we were sent
to go to a more deeper and
bigger excavation site."

Citan
"Just as I thought..."

Captain
"Some say they saw a huge
Gear-like monster.
It seemed like it was
guiding that fishbowl thing
to the excavation site.
Or so I'm told."

Citan
"Stone...
It appears there is
something there for sure."

Captain
"Call it salvager's
intuition, but I don't
wanna get any closer.
And Citan, is that fishbowl
an enemy of yours?"

Citan
"You...
could say that."

Captain
"Well, I won't ask for
revenge.
But I can't just sit back
and do nothing. If you're
against it, we'll help any
way we can.
You can ask Hans anything
about the site."

Hans
"Fishbowl was headed
due north.
The north edge of
that island...
But why? There's nothing
there but a small mine."

Bird Man
I was surprised by the
Wels. They said they
came from Babel Tower.

Old Man
I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.
But when Wels attacked, I
thought about running.

Girl
Men are so weak. 
They try to forget about
their fear of the Reapers
with that crap.

Man
I didn't go ashore this 
time either. Even though
I thought I would.

Man 2
Well, let's toast to
the Thames' survival!"

Man 3
Now we can drink
some more.

Man 2
Amen to that!

Man 3
But what will our 
next job be?

Man 2
What's your job?

Man 3
Oh, this and that.
Forget about that.

Man 5
They're such wimpy
drinkers, that's why they
got beat by the fishbowl
thing.

Drunk Man
Hey, yush din't drink
yous, dat wash mine.

Man 6
Hey, do something with 
this old drunk. He's
worse company than Wels.

"My husband was eaten by
that Reaper -Wels- thing...
We three were the only ones
saved. What do we do now?"

Lance
"Hey, are you picking
on my mom?"

Demi-Human
Only I......survived.
My comrades were taken off
and eaten by the Wels...

Mole
Boy was it a shock. We were
all enthused about being
able to finally dig up stuff
at the excavation site.
Then...ZAP!...
This beam went by!
It was so bright, I thought
my eyes were gonna burn up.
But then a Gear from Thames
saved me.
Boy am I ever thankful...!
But why did that fishbowl
thing attack us? Was it
trying to get at the site?"

Gear 1
Having that job from
the 'Ethos' ruined,
I guess there's no other
way for me to make a
living 'cept diving...
sigh...

Gear 2
The Reapers are good
from afar but afar from
good. 
It's the biggest mistake
they'll ever make
if they miss with a
beefcake like me.

Gear 3
With my warm up
exercises, I'll be able
to save all the drowning
people. Yeah...
exercise...
Ha, ho, ha, ho...

Little Boy
I'm sure the Wels are
followin' us 'cus of the
Captain.

Men!

of the sea!

...Hey!

Ah, here,
yep, just a little more.

Battler 1
The Reapers...are scary.

Little Sister
My big brother is so scared
of the Wels he won't go to
the bathroom alone.
Pathetic.
Just calm down.

Little Brother
My lil' sister pushed me.
She always bullies me.
I'm so scared.
I'm scared of the Wels too.

Shopkeep
Hey!
I'm not closing down even
if the Wels show up.
If you need something,
talk to my stupid son.

That job from the

Unfortunately, I'll have
to delay that job...but
I'm a bit relieved.

BLAM! BAM! KABLAM!
Wast'em all! Just call me

Little Boy
The other day, I saw
a Gear fighting and
it made me want to be
a Gear pilot...sigh...
So many choices.

Man 2
Man! Just when I
thought I could get all
the treasure from that
excavation out of this
supply entrance...

Drunk 2
Well I got one 
thi-----------

What was I talkin' about?

Man 3
...You're
awesome! You're probably
the best salvager in the
world...

Drunk 2
R...really?
Looks like you're finally
beginning to appreciate
my greatness.
