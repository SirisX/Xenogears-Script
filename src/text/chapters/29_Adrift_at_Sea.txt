"Ah, oooooh..."

Elly
"Where am I...?
I was with Fei, heading
for the rear block...
Fei...!
Where are you, Fei?"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Elly, you are awake."

Elly
"Am I awake...?
What were you doing!?"

Fei
"I was looking around
inside here. There's
less than 2 days worth..."

Elly
"Of what?"

Fei
"Food.
We're lucky we
even found any."

Elly
"But, where is everyone!?
Are we the only survivors?"

Fei
"We gotta do something.
Guess I'll go catch some
fish."

Elly
"Fei!"

Fei
"...They're okay."

Elly
"What?"

Fei
"They're okay...doc, Rico,
Hammer, everyone... They're
all going to be okay."

Hammer,
Rico...
Wake up!

Hammer
"Where are we?"

Rico
"What is this place?
Something smells."

Citan
"We are inside the ship
of Bart and his crew.
They rescued us after
we were shot down in
the Goliath."

Rico
"Who the heck are
'Bart and his crew'?"

Citan
"Let us say...they are
bandits...robbing Aveh.
Bart is their leader,
though he is still a
young man."

Rico
"A robber in this day
and age? A man with an
attitude. I like it!!"

Citan
"...
Do you want to start off
by going to meet Bart?"

Rico
"Hmm...
You read my mind!"

Hammer
"I'm staying here!"

Bart
"Well if it isn't Doctor
Citan Uzuki and...errh,
his very big friend!
I see you've finally woken
up. I am terribly sorry
about what happened...
Please forgive me..."

Rico
"I have a name, you know...
It's Ricardo Banderas...
But everyone calls me Rico!
So, what are you
apologizing to us for?"

Bart
"...
I suppose I had better stop
beating around the bush...
I'm not usually this frank
or apologetic but, well..."

Citan
"What he is trying to
say is this...
The people who shot us
down, and the people who
saved us, are one in the
same...this ship's crew!"

Rico
"...?
You don't mean...
That Goliath which we
were riding in was shot
down by...?"

Bart
"Yes, you're a bit slow
there...errh, big friend!
Actually our Yggdrasil II
did a good job in shooting
down that monster of an
airplane!! It was great!"

"You should've seen it!
Wow! My 'Bart Missiles'
sure were awesome...!!"

Rico
"AAAARRRGGHHH!!
I won't forgive
you so easily!!"

Elly
"I knew it...I thought
this thing was floating
unusually...
But even knowing that,
there's no way we can get
them out...right?

Fei
You little...!

Fei
Hold it!

Elly
They're right under us,
but covered by water and
a thick wall."

Fei
You little...!

Elly
"It's probably
Weltall and
Vierge.
For better or worse, they
have stuck by us this far.
...But, they are useless
now at this point though."

Fei
Hold it!

Elly
"It appears our Gears
are underneath here, Fei.
But, we can't reach them...
...What're you doing, Fei?"

Fei
"What am I doing?
Can't you tell...?
I'm trying to catch a fish!
This one's been jumping up
and down, right in front of
me, trying to make me look
like a fool..."

Fei
"You little punk!
I see you!"

Elly
"Uh, umm, you're not
going to catch it and
eat it are you?"

Fei
"If we don't eat,
we're gonna die...
...Alright!! I gotcha!!"

Elly
"You're joking.
You'll get sick."

Fei
"You're not gonna eat?
Let me see... We need
something to cook it with."

...

Elly
"Hey, come on, stop it.
I'm not to blame if you
get sick and die."

Fei
"Don't worry.
Once it's in your stomach
it's all the same."

Elly
"I'm not going to...
Fei!! Look, there..."

Fei
"What!?
Did the fish get away?"

Fei
"What're you talking
about?
It's still there...
What the...!?
...That's...!"

Fei
"That's...that thing I saw
in the desert. It's flying
a lot higher this time."

Elly
"It's Shevat...
That's its usual altitude."

Fei
"Shevat...
Where have I heard...
Yeah, that's right...
That weird masked man!
He said my father was
in its military...
So that saucer is what doc
and that masked man said
was the country my father
and mother lived in?"

Elly
"Really? I wouldn't know...
It's a country outside the
reach of Solaris.
Shevat uses the same kind
of barrier that Solaris
does, so you can't reach
it by conventional means."

Fei
"How can something that
flys that high in the
sky be a 'country'?"

Elly
"Yes. I don't blame you
for being so surprised.
It usually hovers over
the region known as the
Aquvy islands area.
You probably saw it on some
sort of special mission.
That's why it was flying so
low..."

Fei
"Shevat..."

Ouch...

Bart
"I guess the Bart Missiles
weren't such a good idea,
huh...
We were able to save you
and your friends, Citan...
But I wonder what happened
to Fei and Elly..."

Bart
"I'm sure...they're alive
somewhere...
And, once again..."

Bart
"Man!
The sea breeze stings my
eye... So this is what
they call the sea..."

Bart
"First of all, I have to
apologize to those two."

Maison
"Oh, young master...!
If the young master doesn't
come here more often to
receive an education fit for
a prince, then old Maison,
who is in charge of his
upbringing, will disgrace
the very memory of King
Edbart IV... god bless him.
Typical of the young master
not to even listen to me!
The king was peace-loving,
a very generous person...
On the contrary, not only
does the young master, put
his name on a missile, but
goes and shoots an unknown
airplane with it.
To make the matters worse,
his good friend Fei and
company were onboard it..."

Maison
"Anyway, one must apologize
to Doctor Uzuki and his
friend Master Rico, right!?
They were on their way
toward the Gear Hangar..."

Citan
"Oh, young one.
Did you want to
talk to me?"

Bart
"Um... About my shooting
down the Goliath... I'm,
errh, really, errh..."

Citan
"Oh, is that it?
I guess it could not be
helped...
But, jumping the gun is
your bad habit.
A king should always keep
calm and judge carefully!"

Bart
(Maison says the same thing.)

Bart
"Yeah, I know, I know!
By the way, I have
something to ask you..."

Citan
"Oh?
That is unusual."

Bart
"Well, it's about this
warship we're on...
...which is the same type
as the Yggdrasil.
Years ago, my old man told
me it was scrapped because
the peace talks with Kislev
made progress.
So I knew it existed..."

Citan
"Hmm.
Then, what is
bothering you?"

Bart
"The symbol on the ship...
It's not our Royal Crest!
Look at this."

Citan
"This is..."

Bart
"I thought you knew it.
Whose crest is it?"

Citan
"I am not positive but
it looks like Shevat's."

Bart
"Shevat?
What do you mean?"

Citan
"The Yggdrasil may not
have been made by your
father.
At that time, much of the
potential technology was
not understood and hence,
was hidden.
Maybe your father might
have been scared of its
power and so sealed it
away."

Bart
"Hmm, I see.
So this may not have been
ours from the start.
If so, I wanna meet
the guys who made this
amazing baby."

Citan
"Actually, they may
be closer to you
than you suspect..."

Bart
"Huh?
What did you say?"

Citan
"Nothing...I was just
wondering if Fei and
Elly are alright."

Bart
"...
Sorry, it's my fault."

Citan
"N, no,
I did not mean to...
I am sure they are fine."

Bart
"Though there's no proof to
back it up, I feel better
now that you said that...
Even though I know you're
probably lying through your
teeth to make me feel less
worried..."

————————————————————————————
-BEFORE-Talking to Rico

Citan
"Anyway, enough worrying...
But I do think you should
apologize to Rico.
You may get more than a
bruise this time though."

Bart
"Yeah."

Citan
"Rico was checking
on his Gear."

Bart
"Quit the silent treatment!
I came here to apologize!"

Rico
"...
What's your problem!?
I thought I dealt with
you a while ago.
I'm not the type to
dwell on the past."

Bart
...

Rico
"I'm more concerned about
those two Gears there...
Who the hell are you?
I'm amazed you tune them
to run so well!
I thought Fei and I were
the only ones who could
work Gears that well..."

Bart
"Wow you really are the
Battling Champ... Oops,
I mean ex-Champ...
I'm amazed how you can
tell how good a Gear is
just by looking at it."

Rico
"I guess you can't learn
all about the world inside
a dark prison.
Really interesting.
I was gonna move on but
now I've changed my mind...
Let me join you, boss."

Bart
"I guess it's alright..."

Adrift at Sea - 1224
————————————————————————————

Elly
It...seems like
we've drifted
further off.

Fei
...Constantly drifting...
Sounds like me right now.

Elly
What do you mean?

Fei
I've just been drifting
around...being lead by
circumstances.

Elly
No...
that's not right.
In Aveh,
you helped Bart
when he needed it.
And in Kislev,
you gave your all
to defend, to
save everyone.
You've even shown
concern for me
many times.

Fei
No...
I'm just no good.

Elly
Why?

Fei
Probably deep inside,
I'm not really trying
to help.
Somehow, I get the
feeling that all I've
done I did because I
wanted to be needed.
That if I did something
for them...then maybe,
I'd have a
place to belong...
There's a side of me that
comforts itself like that.
That doesn't mean I don't
want to help. But, that
doesn't mean I really want
to help either.
It might not be 'nothing',
but it sure isn't the
'whole' either.
I'd been drifting, led
around until I met you,
Elly.
Now, we're stranded out
in the ocean.
I'm sorry...I got
you involved.

Elly
It's okay.
Don't worry about me.
I've been thinking
why I'm here.
I could've just
gone back.
But for some reason
I didn't...
Probably because
you said it's better
to do something
than nothing.
I think that's why
I felt I had to do
something.
It's OK not to
feel 'whole'.
Even if you only feel
partly complete, if
you repeat that enough,
eventually it'll be
'whole'.
A part...
is better than
zero.

Fei
You're right...
I'm sorry...

Fei
"If we're saved...
will you go back?"

Elly
"I probably won't go back
to my squad.
Right now, I really don't
want to be there...
Besides, I could probably
do something else...
I don't have to be in the
army.
So, I'm thinking of going
back to my country."

Fei
"Is that possible?
But what about the army?"

Elly
"It's not like anyone
knows what I did.
They've probably already
classified me as MIA."

Fei
"Hmm.
I hope at least
you'll survive.
I'm sure you'll
find what you
want to do in
your life."

Elly
"You said...
something about...
being comforted."

Fei
"Yes."

Elly
"Don't be too hard on
yourself. Everyone wants
to be needed at times.
All of us want to give
something inside ourselves
to others to be accepted.
...Even me.
Remember how you forced
yourself to eat those
emergency rations?"

————————————————————————————

Fei
UUUURRRGHH!

Elly
"Hey...are you okay?"

Elly
"I told you not to eat
such a gross looking
animal."

Fei
"It tastes horrible. The
last time I had food this
bad was doc's cooking."

Elly
?

Fei
"But unless we do
something we're
going to die."

Elly
"I guess there's no other
way. I was hoping to save
this a little longer..."

Elly
"This should hold us
for another day...
But it's only for emergency
calories so I can't promise
how good it'll taste."

Fei
"Huh!?
What?
It's dry and crumbly?"

Elly
"I thought so...
You don't like it,
do you?"

Fei
"Wha? N, no...
It's good.
Yeah, ah, it's great.
Whatever you'd share
with me couldn't be
that bad, could it?"

Elly
"You forced yourself to
eat those rations earlier,
didn't you?
For me to survive, it
would have been better
not to share it.
But, watching you eat it
even though it tasted bad
comforted me.
I felt glad that I shared
it with you... It made me
feel a little better."

Fei
"For your own sake?"

Elly
"Yes, for my own sake.
Selfish, I admit.
But, I think it's okay to
be that way at first.
But little by little you
learn about your own
happiness...
And someday you are able to
share that important part
of you with someone else.
Some...day."

Elly
"Ah..."

Fei
"?
What's up?"

Elly
"...Nothing. It just felt
as though I've told you
the same thing long ago...
It must be my imagination.
I couldn't have said it to
you before, because we've
only just met, haven't we?"

Elly
"Yes, it's probably
just my imagination..."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Elly!
Hey, Elly!
Wake up!"

Elly
"Good morning, Fei.
You're up early."

Fei
"No time for formalities.
Look at that!!"

Elly
"Huh?"
