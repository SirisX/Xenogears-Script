DISC 2 - Shot Down! - The Chair - 1840

Dreaming...
 
I was dreaming...
Perhaps it may have been
but a long forgotten memory...
 
A dream...
A memory...

Things remembered
when one is asleep...
Things forgotten
when one is awake...
 
Where the deepest layers
of memories
Become the outmost layers
of one's dreams...
 
Which are reality?
Which are illusions?
One cannot tell until
one awakes...
 
Or perhaps they are,
At the same time, both
Truth and fiction...

A vast nebulous...
With no boundaries...
 
An emptiness equivalent
To my own existence...
 
I dreamt such a dream...
 
A long...
Never-ending,
Dream...

————————————————————————————
Fei's Memory of Painting Sophia - 1946
————————————————————————————

...La...can...

"Lacan, what is wrong?"

"Lacan?"

In that dream,
I was called 'Lacan'...
 
I was an artist...
I had become recognized as a
talented artist and now was
painting the portrait of the
Nisan Mother, 'Sophia'...

Lacan
"Huh...no,
it is nothing."

"...Let us finish for today.
You look rather tired.
...Are you alright?"

Lacan
"I am fine, thank you...
But, now that you mention
it..."

Lacan
"Shall we stop for the day?
You must be the one who is
tired, 'Mother Sophia'?"

Sophia
"Enough of that, now."

Sophia
"When it is just the two of
us, would you stop calling
me that.
Just call me 'Elly'... As
you used to do in the old
days... And you don't have
to be so stiff and formal."

Lacan
"Oh, errh, alright.
Very wel...no, I mean...
Yes, let's do that 'Elly'!"

————————————————————————————
The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

'Elly'...
 
It was a time when she
went by such a name.
A time when we had met
up with one another...
A time when nothing
mattered between us...
 
It was better that way...
Just two people,
together...
 
It was better to have
left it that way...

————————————————————————————

Lacan
"I think I might go back
home...
only for a week or so."

Elly
"Oh, really?
What is the matter?"

Lacan
"I ran out of paint.
So...I, errh, need to
go make some more."

Elly
"You're going all that
way...just to do that?"

Lacan
"If I don't go there,
I won't be able to get
the right pigments."

Elly
"Oh...
Then how about I have
one of my followers,
the -Kahal-, take you
in one of our Gears?"

Elly
"You'll arrive quicker
and you'll be much
more safe."

I lied...
I wasn't out of paint.
I just feared I would
finish the portrait.
I wanted to keep on
painting...forever.
So I wanted to buy
time...
She'd probably despise
me for that...
No,
she'd probably just
give me her usual smile.
She was that kind of
woman...

Dreams...
 
A life of a man named
Lacan...
And the lives of countless
other men...
 
All but dreams...

Now that I am awake,
those countless numbers of
long, heartrending dreams
are almost impossible to
remember at all...
 
In those dreams,
I loved one woman...
No matter the day,
No matter the era...
That did not change...
 
Nor did her name...

————————————————————————————

That dream changed me...
That dream was the catalyst
for me to resolve what my
purpose was.
 
I think I know now...
What I have to do...
 
That long, long memory
of a dream...
Perhaps it was
the memory of my soul...

Elly sitting in The Chair - 1840

A dream...
 
I was dreaming a dream...
Or perhaps it was a memory
From a distant past...
 
A dream...
A memory...

Those words I was
unable to convey...
That day...
That time...
 
Those thoughts I was
unable to carry out...
Words and thoughts...
The connection between
the two...
 
Without words,
Thoughts cannot be conveyed...
Without thoughts,
There are no words...
They are both as vital
as each other...
They can never be
divided...
Like the wings of angels...
Like a man and a woman...

An unchangeable destiny...
Feelings one wishes
one could change...
 
Meeting with the person
who would change me...
And watching myself change...
 
I dreamt such a dream...
 
A long...
Never-ending,
Dream...

...La...can...

"Lacan, what is wrong?"

"Lacan?"

In that dream,
I was called 'Sophia'...
 
Mother Sophia...
A symbolic name...
Crowned upon the person who
would be the people's hope...
A name I was destined to have
Whether I wanted it or not...

Lacan
"Huh...no,
it is nothing."

"...Let us finish for today.

'Elhaym'...
 
I've always liked that name...
Because, when I first met him,
that is what he called me...
 
That is my true name...

I wonder when it started...
 
That he started refusing me...
The walls between us...
Our 'positions'...
Our 'circumstances'...
He refused to recognize these...
 
No...maybe it was me...

Therefore...
I didn't want them...
 
I wanted the two of us
to be ourselves...
 
That is what I wished for...
So,
I had him paint me...
 
The way I really am...

Mysterious old man
"Hmm... He's
finally awake..."

Here you go...

Fei
"I'm...healed..."

Mysterious old man
"You've been sleeping
in this Nanoreactor
for three weeks."

Fei
"Nanoreactor?
Who are you...?"

Mysterious old man
"Me...?"

Mysterious old man
"I forgot my name...
Some people call me
Taura..."

Taura
"You seemed to have
recovered completely.
Those were terrible wounds,
but maybe your youth and
strength helped..."

Taura
"But your friend's wounds
are more serious and may
take a while longer..."

Fei
"My friend...?"

Elly!!

Fei
"Elly..."

Taura
"Hey!
Quit staring at the naked
girl and come over here!"

Fei (*???add*)
!!

Citan
"Fei!!"

Fei
"Doc!!"

Citan
"I heard from Taura and
hurried right over here!
Boy, was that lucky.
You were fortunate to have
come down near Taura's
research facility..."

Taura
"Hm... This is no
research facility. 
It is 'a man's hideaway'!"

Taura
"Citan told me about you.
I was shocked to see a
couple lying down with
blood all over them."

Fei (*???add*)
A couple...

Citan
"At any rate,
you had a narrow
escape.
Fei, make sure
you thank Taura!"

Fei
"Taura,
thank you very much...
for helping Elly..."

Fei
"Both Elly and I were
hurt so badly...
What is that machine...?"

Taura
"It's called a Nanoreactor.
It is a device that can
rebuild substances at
the molecular level.
Not only can it just heal
humans, but theoretically
it should also be able to
create many substances."

Fei
"Is that the same thing
as that guy in Solaris...?
I mean...
Is that the same thing
as Krelian is studying?"

Taura
"Yes, that's right."

Taura
"I was the one who taught
Nanotechnology to him..."

Fei
"You did?"

Taura
"We shouldn't waste time
talking about such an
unimportant subject.
Looks like her treatment
is done."

Taura
"Oh, you don't
need to come.
Just wait there."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Fei..."

Fei
"Elly!!"

Elly
"Fei...
I..."

Taura
"Ahem! Now, why don't you
two go get some fresh air
outside?
It ought to ease the
shock of the change."

Fei
"I knew it was you..."

Elly
"Fei...?"

Fei
"When you came in the
room just then...
I was afraid you may have
forgotten about me and
everything else..."

Elly
"What do you mean...?"

Fei
"I mean...because...
Elly, you seemed a little
different than before..."

Elly
"Has my face...changed?"

Fei
"No, that's not it...
It's more like..."

Fei
"I mean your atmosphere or
impression is different...
just a little..."

Fei
"But, I felt something
familiar...
I felt the same way when
I met you for the first
time...
Some peculiar feeling
like we've met before,
somewhere..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"Yes?"

Elly
"I don't remember much
what happened after we
were shot down..."

Fei
"It's better that way."

Elly
"But I heard someone
calling my name...
I felt I was covered with
something very warm...
I remember that clearly..."

Fei
"..."

Elly
"Thank you, Fei."

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Taura
"Hey, it's almost time
for you to come back.
There's something
important we need to
talk to you about."

Fei (*???add*)
...

Fei
"A, alright,
we're coming!"

Fei
"Well, Elly,
shall we go
see what's up?"

Elly
"S, sure..."

Taura
"How do you feel now?
The fresh forest air
should have refreshed
you somewhat, heh?"

Taura
"Anyway...
It's about the removal
of the seal...
I found out it can be
released by using the
Nanotechnology that
regenerated you two."

Taura
"The Nanoassemblers are
enclosed in this pod."

Citan
"If only we could scatter
them all over the world..."

Taura
"There's an ancient
military installation
nearby...
We might be able to use the
'Mass-driver' located in
there to launch this pod
into the upper atmosphere.
Once the Nanoassemblers
are released up there, the
convection currents should
spread 'em over the world!"

Taura
"I wish I could go do it...
but I am getting much too
old for that type of thing.
Then again, it's for your
future. An old man should
not butt in. You young ones
must do it for yourselves!"

Taura
"Here."

Taura
"And, of course,
I'm not asking you
to do it for free.
Try this wrist band
on."

Fei (*???add*)
?

Citan
"What is that?"

Taura
"This is an 'Emotion
Control Device' in which
nanotechnology is applied.
From this machine shaped as
a wrist band, nanomachines
are infused through your
epidermis into your brain.
There they refine the SSRI
intracerebral substances,
such as Serotonin, that
control emotions."

Fei (*???add*)
??

Taura
"Well, I suppose it's
rather difficult for
you to understand...
But in short, it means
that the manifestation of
your second personality,
'Id', can be suppressed."

Fei
"Id..."

Elly
"Fei..."

Taura
"Well, it's all theoretical
though... Oh, and I did one
more thing as well...!
I installed the same
control device in your
Gear..."

Citan
"You mean, it can
release Id at will...?"

Taura
"Yes.
I called it 'System Id'.
But of course it should
not be over-used.
Use it only as a last
resort."

Fei
"Elly, doc,
I..."

Citan
"Fei, there was nothing
you could do...
It will never happen again
with Taura's technology
though. He is one of the
three Shevat sages."

Taura
"Whether you believe it
or not, it's up to you."

Fei
"..."

Taura
"Oh?
It sounds like
we have a guest!"

"Fei...!
We've got problems!!"

Shevat Emissary
"Today, a peace settlement
between Aveh and Kislev
is being held at Shevat...
But, Solaris' mobile
weapons are approaching
Shevat as we speak!
Please, help us!"

Taura
"That has nothing to do
with this young man!!"

Shevat Emissary
"Taura!!"

Taura
"You're getting on my
nerves for being so
selfish.
Citan told me about you.
You showed up after
finding out that Id is
now controllable...
Aren't you ashamed? You
haven't changed since
then. You only care
about yourselves."

Taura
"Fei! You don't need to
listen to these guys who
once tried to kill you!!"

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"..."

Elly
"Please go.
I'll go to the
Mass-driver..."

Fei
"Elly?"

Elly
"No matter what happened
before, Shevat needs your
help now.
Although you may be saving
some selfish people...
there is still the world
and its countries with
many more innocent people.
Please,
don't forget that."

Elly
"Bart and his people are
fighting to protect those
same lives, aren't they?
So, please go help them!"

Fei
"Are you sure?
What about you?"

Elly
"Don't worry about me.
I'll manage somehow."

Fei
"But, all by yourself..."

Citan
"I will accompany Elly.
You do not need to worry.
I have brought along my
own Omnigear."

Fei
"Your own Omnigear...?"

Citan
"Yes my Omnigear,
'Fenrir'.
It is the same one I
brought from Solaris.
I left it with Gaspar
in case of emergencies."

Fei
"Doc...
Alright. Please take
care of her for me."

Fei
"Elly, be careful."

Elly
"I will."

Shevat Emissary
"We are truly grateful
for your kindness, Fei!!"

Taura
"Hmph!
Suit yourselves."

Fei
"Ignas, right?"

Shevat Emissary
"Yes.
The goal of the enemy is to
destroy the cities in Ignas.
They have already destroyed
half of Bledavik and will
probably reach Nisan in 
about four hours.
Shevat will try to drive
them back with all the
power it has!"

Fei
"Four hours...
That's cutting it close!"

Taura
"No need to worry.
Balthasar and I fixed your
Gear with the nanomachines.
It's much more powerful
than it ever was before.
Why, you should get there
in half the time."

just can't explain with
the word...fate.
You're just going to have
to see it with your own

"Are you sure you want to
go through with this?
You wanted to live quietly
away from the battle
field, did you not?"

Elly
"I noticed myself running
away from reality...
At first, I thought
my situation was
similar to his.
I thought Fei would
understand my feelings...
I didn't know if my love
for him was real...
I might have been desperate
after losing my mother and
father..."

Citan
"Elly..."

Elly
"Despite all that...
I may still love him...
That's why, I want to
see what Fei can do

I want us to be apart

ourselves again."

Elly

Elly.
What happened to you

I don't think
I've changed..."

Citan
"Yes, you have.
I should say...
you have matured...
...Like a mother..."

Elly
"Excuse me!
I'm only 18 years old.
I'm nowhere near the
age of being your
mother!"

You gave me that

I go!

I'll be fine on my own."

Emeralda have to go
with you."

Elly
"Emeralda...?"

Emeralda
"No!
Emeralda go too!"

Citan
"Why not let her go?
I am sure Solaris has a
hunch about the Limiter.
They may interfere, so
you may feel uneasy going
it alone. I think Emeralda
is cut out for this job."

Citan
(...Besides, she is going
to want to go no matter
what.
Take care of her until I
can join you, please?)

notice...
They looked the spitting

Yes, just as you yourselves

Blue 4
What do you mean...
he's still alive...!?

Krelian
"Yes."

Red 4
Ridiculous.
Didn't Ramsus shoot
him down?

Krelian
"She was also on the Gear
that Ramsus shot down.
I won't have her die."

Blue 2
But, there is already
a 'mother'...
Although she may be the
'Antitype', as long as the
current mother exists...

Krelian
"As far as I see it,
that is not complete."

Red 3
Quite picky aren't you...?
Didn't you say you threw
away all human emotions?

Krelian
"I don't care what you
think. Anyway...
As far as he is concerned,
I will put Ramsus onto him.
Any objections?
Where is he presently?"

Blue 3

towards Ignas.

Krelian
"I see.
So he has left the area...
(That means...
it is only a matter of
time before the seal is
broken...)"

Red 2
Did you say something?

Krelian
"It's nothing.
Just sit there and wait
for the good news."

the girl?
The key is already
beginning to resonate.

to be now...

On my way to Ignas,

       Kahran Ramsus...
Ramsus once again
   stood in my way,
      in his Omnigear
         'Vendetta'...

It was an unavoidable
battle. I released the

added to my Mark II
Gear... 'System Id'!

Ramsus'
   absolute confidence
      was shattered...
Leaving only his
   cry of disbelief
      and resentment,
Ramsus' machine
   disappeared into
      a sea of foliage.
Why he was so
   fixated on me...
      I know not why.
         But he did say
            this...

If only you
   didn't exist...
