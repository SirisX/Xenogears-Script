Captain
"What's wrong?
What do you need?
Point x1507, z1235?
Hans, does that sound
familiar?"

Hans
"It's Sargasso point."

Captain
"What?
The Sargasso?"

Fei
"Sargasso, what's that?"

Captain
"It's a cave formed from
microbes over many years.
It's supposed to have
hidden treasure but no
one's ever returned from
there.
The story is that the cave
itself is alive. Are you
going to the Sargasso?"

Fei
"It looks like it."

Captain
"Your Gears can't dive that
deep. If they did, you
would not be able to move.
Equip your underwater gear
here. Then take your ship
as far as you can and dive
in with your Gear.
I'll go wake those
winos up, right now."

Fei
"Really? It's okay with
you? Thanks for always
helping us out, Captain."

Captain
"Don't mention it."

————————————————————————————

Captain
"It looks like
they're done."

Fei
"That was fast."

Captain
"Of course.
We're..."

Fei
"Men, of the sea, right?"

Captain
"Blimey. 
I think he's got it.
Take care then."

Fei
"Yeah."

Captain
"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell
you how to operate them
underwater.
It's easy. You can jump in
water without your feet
touching the ground. Keep
jumping to build up speed.
You can swim pretty well in
a Gear, but there may be
places you can't get past
if you don't do it well."

Fei
"Got it.
Thanks."

Captain
"No need for thanks.
Maybe you can buy something
from our Gear shop. 
Looks like there be some
new booty to sell."

Hans
"Since our work with the
'Ethos' has deep sixed
we've lost our 'porpoise'!
Guess we'll just have to
stick with wandering the
seas and salvaging.
Seems Thames will have to
continue this haphazard
lifestyle after all."

Fei
"Is this, 
the 3rd gate......
......?"

Fei
"Who are you?"

Emeralda (*Not named ???)
I will...
kill you.

Mysterious Gear
"How do you do?
I am a Rattan, one of the
followers of Krelian.
Please excuse me, I'd like
to show you my face but as
a result of the
human-machine fusion..."

Citan
"You are the ones who left
Kahr for the surface...
You must have a good
reason."

Rattan
"Our current task is
totally about inspection
of the evidence.
It'll ruin everything if
someone as dead to the
world as he appeared here.
A person who's calm and
cool like myself would be
perfect for the job.
Oh, but don't worry.
I'll just be inspecting
here. Emeralda here, will
take care of you."

Emeralda
"......Kill...you."

"Ki......m...?
Ah, ah-a-a, I..."

Rattan
"...I see...
Reckless...now that...
You should view it as a
release of...memory,
or maybe a recording.
It turned out just as
Krelian said...
It is a manifestation of
the imprinting.
At any rate, it is proven.
With that, excuse me.
I must report the results.
Oh yes, go ahead and take
the girl.
Use her anyway you like.
After all, she is your
'daughter'..."

Emeralda (*Added name here*???)
Ah, a
aha-a-a-a-a!!

Fei
"...
...Let's...see..."

Fei
"What the hell is it
saying?"

Elly
"..."

Elly
"Fei...?
You mean, he resembles
someone you know?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT-

Elly
"Does Fei resemble
someone you know?"

————————————————————————————

Emeralda
What do you mean by
'resemble'? Kim is Kim?

Elly
"Kim? The person
resembling Fei, right?
Who is he? Is he the one
who created you?"

Emeralda
What do you mean by
'creating me'?
Kim is Kim!
Don't you see?

Emeralda
Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim! Kim!
Kim! You're really here!
I thought I was dreaming.
The person in my dream.
Yes, Kim! I was dreaming!
A long long dream.

Elly
"Sounds like you
resemble him. Someone
important to her...
probably the person
who created her..."

————————————————————————————
-ALT-

Elly
"It seems you resemble
him. Someone important
to her...
probably the person
who created her..."

Fei
"Huh...?"

Fei
"H, hey you.
My name is Fei.
Not Kim."

Emeralda
Now I know, Fei's Kim!
Listen, listen, I was
dreaming! A long long
dream!

Fei
"...Kim is fine..."

Citan
"For her, 'Kim' means
more than just a name.
...More like...'father'."

Fei
"...Father?..."

Citan
"No, no, I mean it has
general meaning."

Emeralda
Listen, listen, Kim!
I was dreaming about 
really old times.
Kim was much older,
and I was in some clear
tube...
Kim was...putting many 
candles on a white soft
confection...
I didn't know why he
was doing that...
But I sensed he was 
looking forward to me
coming out of the tube...

...
But...soon everyone... 
was gone...
My body disappeared...
Then I was in somewhere
dark for a long...
long time...

Please! Promise you'll
stay, Fei's Kim!?

Fei
"Huh?...Uh yeah."

Emeralda
Really?
Really truly?

Elly
"Really."

Emeralda
Don't bother me!
Who is this old lady?
I'm talking to Kim!

Elly
"Old lady...!
Maybe I should bury
her back at the
ocean floor..."

Fei
"Hey..."

Elly
"Why don't you be her
Kim? The Fei...Kim!!"

Fei
"Umm..Oh...
...By the way,
do you have a name?"

Emeralda
Oh no! You're cruel,
Fei's Kim!
It's me, Emeralda,
Emeralda!
Kim named me because
I have emerald hair!
Don't you remember...?

Fei
"Okay, okay.
Emeralda, right?
Alright, Emeralda.
I'll stay with you this
time. I promise!"

Emeralda
"Really? Really truly?
Yeah!"

Citan
"...I doubt Krelian acted
on his own to use her as a
disposable soldier.
Some information existed
in her which passed over
to Krelian.
Who knows what he will
do next.
We must find Solaris
before that happens..."

Received a telegram
from Shevat!
Due to a weakening
gate, a city that
may be Solaris has
been discovered!!

Citan
"Perfect!!
Let us go back to
Shevat for now!"

Shevat - Queen Zephyr's Chamber - 1512
————————————————————————————

Zephyr (*??? added name*)
We are finally able to
locate and see Solaris
after destroying the 3
Gates on the surface.
However, unless we destroy
the final main generator on
the Solaris homeland...
...we cannot completely
wipeout their Gate.

Citan
"Maria, this is where you
and Seibzehn come in.
Now that the Gate is
weakened, we can use
Seibzehn's heavy
particle cannon...
...to distort space
and neutralize the Gate
for a brief moment!
Upon penetrating into
Solaris, it would be best
to move about...
...in small groups so that
we do not attract
attention.
Well, if possible I would
like to..."

Elly
"Yes...
I can guide you...
through Solaris..."

Fei
"I'll go too. I'm a little
concerned if it's Elly."

Elly
"What are you...?
Wait, I didn't mean it
like..."

Citan
"Understood!
Then Elly, Fei, and I will
move about together.
The rest will form a
separate group to sneak in.
Maria, it looks like you
and Seibzehn will wait
outside on standby."

Maria
"Fine...
I understand."

Citan
"Well, let us break up
for now.
Once you are all ready,
we should all meet here
before we take off..."

Yui
"You're going aren't
you... To Solaris..."

Citan
"Yes...
I have chosen my own path.
There is no turning
back..."

Yui
"You will be hurt...
They will also be hurt..."

Citan
"Indeed...
But I could not find any
other path to choose...
If I happen to be overcome
by the dark side... At
that point, I have
already..."

Yui
"Don't say anything more.
I already know..."

Yui
"Now, here.
This is your sword...
Please...
Please come back alive!"

Citan
"Then you too...
Please take care of
Midori."

Listen, Hyuga.
I'm going to Solaris, too.

Jessie
"Don't misunderstand me.
It doesn't mean I'll help
you.
I don't know what you're
thinking or trying to
do...
But, if you take their
side, I'll kill you without
a doubt. Even from the
back..."

Citan
"Yes...
I will be counting on
that."

Jessie
"Heh...
so discouraging..."
