Fei
"Huff...huff...
Damn you...!!"

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"Hiyaaaaa!"

Fei
"Huff, huff...
That's one down!?"

Fei
"What on earth are you?
No matter how often
I knock you down
you still get up!"

Citan
"Fei! Stop!
You must not
fight here!"

Fei
"Guh!
Boy are you
persistent!"

Fei
"Huff, huff... Damn it!
How come...? Why did it
have to come to this?"

Fei
"Whew!
That about does it..."

Fei
"Alright...
Now for a
short break."

———————————————————————————————————

Maid
"Hello, Fei.
You're looking well today."

Maid
"My, how time flies! Why, it
has already been 3 years since
you came to our village...
When they first saw you brought
in all bloody and soaken, to
tell you the truth, they didn't
think you were going to make it.
And that strange masked man who
carried you here that day...
Do you think that maybe he was
your real father?
Don't you remember anything?
Why, they say you had terrible
nightmares and constantly
called out for your father."

Who is it? 

Chief Lee
"Wh, who are you? ...
What? You want me to
look after this boy?"

Maid
"But now, you're so
healthy and strong...
And it's all thanks to our
village chief, Lee.
My, should you be grateful!"

Maid
"It's alright for you to
like painting and all...
But please try not to make
so much mess. Cleaning isn't
such an easy job you know!"

Lahan Village - Chief Lee's House - Wedding Day Plans - 0632
———————————————————————————————————

Timothy
"Yo! Hi there, Fei.
Sorry for us all using
your house like this.
But, we have to talk about
the big day tomorrow with
the village chief."

Fei
"Yeah tomorrow, huh...
Your wedding with Alice!
Now that is a big day!"

Timothy
"Yeah... right...
But it still hasn't hit
me as reality though."

Fei
"Hey, errh, Timothy.
I just want to thank
both you and Alice...
3 years ago, I woke up
in this village without
a trace of my memory...
I didn't know who I was,
where I had been or what
I had been doing up until
that day...
I couldn't recall a
single thing..."

Fei
"Despite that, you and
Alice sympathized with me
and encouraged me to go on.
If the two of you hadn't
have been there for me,
I don't know what would
have become of me..."

Fei
"Timothy...
From the bottom of my
heart, I thank you!
Now, you and Alice
had better live
happily ever after!"

Timothy
"Hah! Quit it will ya!
You don't have to go and
get all mushy on me...
Anyway, to me it feels
like I've always been
friends with you ever
since we were kids."

Timothy
"And we will go on being
friends forever, right?"

Fei
"Of course!"

Timothy
"Oh yeah, Fei...
Could you stop by
and check on Alice?
I still have stuff to
discuss with my old man
and the village chief.
But I'm sure she'll
be glad to have some
company."

Fei
"Yeah, sure!
I'll do that... Anyway,
I'll see you later.
Oh, and I am really
looking forward to the
ceremony tomorrow."

Dan
"So there you are! 
Fei, I have to talk to
you about something!"

Fei
"Why, hello there Dan!
You're lively today...
as you are everyday!"

Timothy
"Dan! Don't be so rude.
What's this barging in
and all?"

Dan
"Argh! Timothy's
here too."

Dan
"Butt out, Timothy!
Until you marry my
sister, you have
nothing to do
with me at all!
I just have some
business here with
my friend Fei!"

Dan
"So anyway Fei, I errh...
I have something to talk
to ya about later..."

Fei
"What is it, Dan?
It sounds serious!"

Dan
"Yeah, that's why I can't
talk about it here...
There's a certain person
listening in who could
cause us trouble...!"

Dan
"It's really important!
We gotta talk, seriously,
one-on-one, man-to-man!
I'll be hanging around
outside. So I'll see
ya there later, OK!"

Dan
"Be seein' ya, Timothy!
Take care of yourself
until tomorrow..."

Fei
"Huh...? 
What's up with him?"

Timothy
"As of tomorrow, I'm
going to be that kid's
brother-in-law...
Hah!
That part isn't going
to be no honeymoon!"

Chief Lee
"Oh, it's you, Fei.
We're in the middle
of discussing Timothy
and Alice's wedding
arrangements."

Chief Lee
"Hey, why don't you bring
a girlfriend or two home
once in a while?
Just because you live with
an old man like me doesn't
mean you have to hold back
now, you hear!?
Why, when I was as young
as you are, it seemed like
everyday I would..."

Ahem!
Ohum!

Chief Lee
"Oh, errh... never mind.
Now, we still have
important things to
discuss... so don't
get in the way now."

Chief Lee
"We still have many
important things to
talk about...
So you had better
not bother us now."

Timothy's Father
"Hello there, Fei.
Our Timothy is a really
lucky boy to be able to
marry such a beautiful
girl like Alice!
I hope you come up with
some embarrassing tales
to tell in your speech!
Hah haah haaah!"

Alice's Uncle
"I don't know whether to be
happy or sad...
Tomorrow, our little Alice
is going to become someone's
wife...
I knew this day would come!
...This is the worst part of
bringing up a little girl!"

Sigh...

Woman
You know Fei, I am sure that
our village chief thinks of
you as his own grandson...
Not having any family for
all those years, and living
on his own for oh so long...
That's why he cares so very
dearly about you!

Please, never do anything that
would break his poor old heart!
You promise me that, Fei!?

———————————————————————————————————

-AFTER- After visiting Alice

Timothy
"So how was Alice? I still
can't believe we're really
getting married tomorrow!
It's such a weird feeling.
We've always been together
ever since we were just
little kids..."

Dan
"Oh good, Fei!
Ya ready to talk?"

Dan
"As you know, tomorrow's
finally the day of my
sister's wedding...
So, what I want to talk
to you about is exactly
that... Alice's marriage!"

Dan
"Fei, to be perfectly
honest with you...
I've always wished
you could have been
my brother."

Dan
"It's still not too late.
You could go steal Alice
and run off with her!
If you need me to help,
I'd be glad to!"

Dan
"It may be odd for me to say
this, but my sister's
beautiful and a good cook...
(and this is just between
you and me but, she's
well endowed too! 
Heh heh heh!)"

Dan
"So c'mon! Go for it!
    Let's do it!!
    That's crazy 

Fei
"Alright Dan,
you've got it...
I guess I'll just go sweep
Alice away and make a run
for it!"

Dan
"Really!?
I knew I liked you, Fei!
That's the spirit!"

Dan
"... But, if only
it was that easy...
It's not like we can
change their feelings...
And you would need to
have love for her too..."

Dan
"But, I'm not gonna
forget this, Fei!
You were really willing to
go that far to help me...
Fei, you're a good guy!"

———————————————————————————————————
-OPTION 2-

Fei
"Hey...
What are you talking
about, Dan?
Timothy and Alice are both
my best friends.
You know I can't do that!"

Dan
"Tch, yeah I know that.
Well if you're gonna be
like that..."

Dan
"But, if you change your
mind, come and talk to
me!"

———————————————————————————————————

"Timothy is a balding
headed fool! And his dad
is bald and stupid too!"

"Mountain path ahead!
Beware of the HP
gobbling hob-gobs!!
Those wishing to see the
doctor on the mountain top
should proceed with courage
and conviction."

"Alice and Fei
are in looove!!"

"From all the cool
people of Lahan...
  Buon giorno!"

"- The Laughing Fox  
   & Piglet Tavern - 
   Drunks welcome!  "

" - Lahan's General Store - 
    You want it?
    We've got it...(maybe)! "

Fei
"Phew!
That was a close one...
This well is dangerous...
Perhaps it's better if I
don't go near it again."

Received a chill from the
depths of the cistern!
Oh 'well'...!

'High' there Fei!
Did you know that beyond
that black forest lies the
great kingdom of Aveh?
It's got a big capital
city with lots of people
living there.
My father is working
somewhere in Aveh.

Soon, my father is going
to come pick mother and
me up so that we can all
live together in Aveh.

Oh, father!
Please come home soon...

Hey hey, Fei!
Let's go catch some
scampi again sometime!

I'm gonna get you!

Hey hey, Fei!
Help me find another
elephantsparrow's
nest sometime, okay!!?

Run away!

Hey, Fei. Next time,
teach me more of your
kung fu stuff.

I'm gonna get you!

Hey, Fei!
Let's go tease
the girls again!

Run away!

Birds are great...
They can fly so high in
the sky and go wherever
they want to...

You know Fei... Mom
was saying that you
might have come from
a far away place...

If you were a bird,
you could fly back
to your real home
anytime you wanted.

———————————————————————————————————
That Dan...!
When will he ever grow up!?

Small Girl
Oh, Fei!
Maybe you can help...
Have you seen Dan?

Fei
"Oh, he's just hanging
about over there...
He's thinking about his
sister's marriage and
doesn't seem to be able
to calm down.
He likes to talk and act
big, but he really is
still just a kid...
It's kinda cute, huh?"

Small Girl
Oh really?
I'm a little suspicious
though...
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...
I bet he's avoiding me...

Small Girl
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...
How could a brat like
him possibly be related
to Alice?
Oh, brother...!

You're right! I've got my
whole life ahead of me!
I've got to strive harder
to fulfil my goals in life.

Sigh... The never ending
hardships of a woman.

Alice and Timothy's
wedding tommorow is
the talk of the town.
I guess it's to be
expected though...
It is one of life's
biggest events.

The women of the village
are born, raised, married
and live out the rest of
their lives here.
There must be some
happiness in that, but...
I've been thinking from
time to time.
Sometimes I wish I were
born a man so I could
travel the world and live
an ever-changing life...

Heh... It's weird, isn't it?
    Yeah, that is weird!
    No, of course not! 

Ooooooh! You think so?
Maybe I need to rethink
this...

Really? Do you mean it?
Hah, I knew you'd say
that for me, Fei.
Here, this is my very
own homemade Aquasol.
Our bearcows love it! 
Try it out sometime!

Received Aquasol, the
choice of all bearcows.

Hello, Fei.
Tomorrow is Alice and
Timothy's big day.
Isn't it exciting!
I know Alice will
make a lovely bride.
Ahh... I hope a
handsome prince comes
into my life soon.

Hey! Stop pushing!
What are you...some
kind of pervert!?

That doctor is weird!
Why would anyone want to
live up on that mountain
peak?
He should live closer to
the village...
Hey, you're good friends
with the doctor. Why
don't you ask him to move
closer to the village!

Lately, my legs have
gotten weaker...
It's causing me a great
deal of trouble.
I would like to go and
have Doctor Uzuki take
a look and see if he
can help me...
But it's a tremendous task
to go up that mountain path
to visit the doctor.
I must be getting old...

That doctor's eccentric!
Why else would anyone
live up on a mountain
peak like that?
He should have moved
closer to the village!
Fei, you're good friends
with the doctor...
Ask him to move closer
to our village for us!

Lately, my legs have been
giving me trouble.
It's really getting to me!
I would like to go and have
Doctor Citan Uzuki take a
look at them and tell me
what's wrong...
But it's a dreadful chore
to climb that mountain path
to visit the doctor.
It must be a sign of my age.

Uuh... Sob...
How could Alice go and get
married...and to that
muscle head, Timothy...!!
I...I've loved her...
since I was a baby...!!
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to live!?

AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHH!! 

Sob... Life...
can be so unfair...

Uh... Sob...
Woe is me...!

Zzzzzz, snore...

Uh, uhn...?
Oh, it's you Fei!
What do you want?

Finally, at my age,
I've become able to
live in peace.
At this rate, I'll
probably live to be
a hundred! Hahahah!

No, no!
Don't waste perfectly
good food like that!

Fei!!
I thought I told you
not to step on my food!

You know you won't come out
in one piece if you try and
pull anything on the bride!

Welcome to the village
of Lah...
Oh, it's you, Fei!?

Oh, don't worry...
We already consider
you a proud member of
the Lahan community!
So, how about finding a
wife and settling down
in our village too?
I'm sure if you live a
peaceful life here your
memory will be bound to
come back one day.

You have a natural ability
to paint and can do martial
arts rather well, I hear!
I bet it's because your body
remembers these things.
You'll be able to breathe
a sigh of relief when your
memory returns to you...
And don't you worry!
I'm sure it will!

Yo, Fei!
Alice has sure
gotten pretty, huh!
Come to think of it...
Alice, Timothy and you
were always together.
I bet you also had a
crush on Alice too, eh?
Am I right? Hahahaha!

Oh, hello there, Fei.
Come to think of it,
it's already been quite
a while since you first
came to our village...
I take it you still
don't remember anything
prior to your coming
here though?
It must be terrible
not knowing your true
identity and all...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being rude...
Please don't take it
the wrong way.

Sorry.
That's all the
Aquasol I have.
But I've got plenty of
my special fertilizer.
Ya want some?
Hahaha!

Oh alright. Here ya go!

Received Aquasol.

Oh yeah, I forgot!
Here's some of my
homemade Aquasol!
I used my special
fertilizer in it so
it should work real
well! Haw-haw-haw!

Received Aquasol.

Hmmm... Oh I'm just
contemplating what I
should plant next.

It's a lot of work just
trying to raise crops.
But it's an excellent
feeling, Fei.
In this great open land,
new life emerges...
I'm not saying we're
doing it.
It's just the earth, 
rain and sun combining 
together to nurture 
these striving new lives.
We're just helping 
them out.

Pumpkinberry...
Applelily... radish...
Hmmm, they all seem
good...

This is the village
consultant's house.
He can teach you
all kinds of things.
Before you step outside
of our village, it might
be wise to stop by here
for some advice first.

———————————————————————————————————
Lahan Village - Village Consultant's House - Lucca - 0616
———————————————————————————————————

Good day. 
I'm the village consultant.
(But to tell you the truth,
the village chief knows far
more than I do...
However, the chief is an
awfully busy person, so I
have been placed in charge
of answering some of the
more mundane questions.)

As a special for this week,
we are lecturing on the
techniques of "Marshal Art's"
self defense. Wouldn't you
like to learn about it?

What can I do for you today?

    Explain battle commands
    Explain 'Defense' option
    Explain 'Action Points'
    Explain 'Attack' option
    Explain 'Combo' option
    Nothing now, thanks. 

Alright then.
Allow me to explain the
overall battle commands.

During battle, there are two
groups of commands you can
choose from. You can toggle
between groups with the Left
& Right Directional buttons.
The first group includes the
most frequently used Attack,
Defense and Chi options.
The second group contains
special commands such as
Combo, Escape and so forth.
You fight by skillfully
selecting from the two
groups of options the
action that best suits
your circumstances.
Normally, you should be
able to get by with just
the first group of options.
The item option is in both
sets, so you don't have to
switch groups to use items.

...Well, that pretty much
wraps it up. Please come
back again whenever you
need my services.

Oh I see, I see. You wish
to inquire about Defense? 
Well allow me to begin...

By choosing 'Defense', you
can halve the damage your
opponent does to you.
Fighting is not just about
being on the offensive - at
times it pays to hold back.
When you find yourself in a
pinch, it may be a good idea
to leave the attacking up to
your other party members and
simply choose to defend
yourself from enemy attacks.

...Well, that's about it.
Oh, and if you have any
other questions, please
feel free to stop by any
time now, you hear!?

Aha! I knew you were going
to ask me about them! 
Well then, allow me to
explain about Action Points.

There are three kinds of
attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each using
up a set amount of Action
Points when performed.
When all your Action Points
are used up, your turn will
end. Conversely, as long as
you have Action Points left,
you may continue to attack.
In other words, Action
Points represent how many
attacks you can perform in
one turn of combat.
In the beginning, you
will only start out with
3 Action Points. However,
as you increase in level,
your Action Points will
increase accordingly.
The secret in putting up a
good fight lies in how you
utilize your Action Points
- what strengths of attacks
you use, and in what order
you dish them out in...!

...Well, that's it in a
nutshell. Oh, and don't
hesitate to ask if you
have any other queries!

My, you are bold!
Okay then, allow me to
explain to you a little
about attacking.

I am sure that you already
know that there are 3 types
of Attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each of which
uses up a different amount
of Action Points.
The Fierce Attack (<X> button)
uses up 3 points in a single
blow. Hence, if you have only
3 Attack Points, all will be
used up in one Fierce Attack.
The Weak Attack (<T> button)
will use up 1 point per blow.
So, with 3 Attack Points, you
can attack the same enemy 3
times in rapid succession.
The Strong Attack (<S> button)
uses up 2 points per blow.
So, if you've got 3 Attack
Points, you can combine one
Strong Attack with one Weak
Attack to total 3 points.
It is possible to continually
press the <X> button to keep
obliterating enemies in one
Fierce blow, but you may find
out that relying on this will
have repercussions later.

...That's about all I have
to say about that, really.
Please come by again when
you're in need of advice.

Ooooh! The 'Combo' option,
eh? I didn't expect you to
ask about it! Well then,
allow me to explain the
art of the 'Combo'.

When you use the Attack
option, there are times
when you do not use up
all your Action Points.
Such is the case when
you eliminate an enemy
by using only a fraction
of your total points, or
when you cancel midway
through an attack turn.
Action Points which don't
get used are stored in an
'AP Counter'. When this AP
Counter stores up a certain
amount of points, you will
become able to use 'Combos'.
'Combos' are rapid series of
Deathblows let loose all at
one time, and they tend to
be rather ferocious. Any
foe on the receiving end of
a 'Combo' will likely die.
At low experience levels,
you probably won't be able
to do much 'Combo' damage.
But in time you will become
able to do some devastating
'Combo' maneuvers!

...And that's that!
So, if you need any
other advice, you
know where I am!

I see. Well anyway...
feel free to ask me
anything, anytime!

Ahem!
AHEM!

So as not to bother other
clients, please keep all
personal conversations
down to a minimum!

When it comes to fighting
techniques, I tend to be
extremely fussy!
I've started to study up
on them recently...

How 'bout it then?
Wanna hear what I have to say?
    Explain 'Abilities'
    Explain 'Deathblow Skills'
    Explain 'Skill Levels'
    Forget it!

Hmmm, you're pretty
scholarly for a young'un.
Good, now listen up!

That 'Guided Shot' ability
you already have is one of
the many mysterious powers
related to Ether and Chi.
Not everyone has the
talent to use such powers.
People are each born with
differing innate abilities.
If that individual does
have the gift, increasing
in level will give birth
to more powerful abilities.

Hmm. I see a lot of
potential in you.

Good, good.
Ask away young'un!

As you already know, there
are 3 strength levels for
the ordinary Attack option:
Weak   Attack (<T> button),
Strong Attack (<S> button) and
Fierce Attack (<X> button).
'Deathblow Skills' are special
chains of Attacks that first
use some Weak or Strong blows
to knock your foe off balance
and then end with a Fierce
blow to do some major damage!
But first you must master
the use of Weak, Strong
and Fierce Attacks in order
to become able to learn
such 'Deathblow Skills'.
To master these Attacks, you
should keep trying to do, say,
four Weak blows in a row, or
two Strong blows, or even a
Fierce blow accompanied by
another type of blow.
In other words, the way to
learn new 'Deathblow Skills'
is through the frequent use
of various combinations of
the three basic Attacks!

So, whatcha' think?
Doesn't it just make ya want
to go out there now and start
learning those 'Deathblow
Skills' as soon as possible!?

Alright, here we go!
More about Deathblows
and their relation to
Experience Levels...!

If you want to see how
close you are to learning
certain 'Deathblow Skills',
go to the Menu Screen and
then to the Status Screen.
From the Status Screen you
can select 'Skills' to view
a list of your Deathblows,
with meters showing the
percentage learned so far.
If one of the Deathblows
just doesn't seem to be
increasing, then you're
probably using the wrong
types of Attack buttons.
In that case, it might be
best to try those Attacks
you normally haven't been
using. So experiment with
different attack patterns!
But remember this...!
Some 'Deathblow Skills'
cannot be obtained until
you have reached a certain
level of experience!
If you have not attained
that experience level, then
it won't matter even if the
Deathblow's meter has
reached 100%...!
In this case, you will have
to wait until your level of
experience increases before
you will be able to learn
to use that Deathblow!

... And that's about it.
If you keep up in your
studies, you're bound
to go far!

Here you go...
This is an allowance for
being such an enthusiastic
scholar! Hah hah hah!

Received 80G!

Buy some pencils and
books with that, OK!? 
Stick with it, kid!

Oh well... You can never
be too old to study. There
are mountains of things to
learn out there, young'un!

Lucca
Don't tell me!
It's about the
'Memory Cube',
right?

Oh good, good!
You're lucky, you came
just at the right time...
If it's about the 'Memory Cube',
then don't hesitate to ask me.
No one knows better than I do!

How about it then?
Want to hear me out?
    Yeah, okay!
    No, not really!

Alright! Good show!
That's the spirit!
You're pretty smart
for an artist.
Now, open up those
ears and carve every
word I say into that
tiny brain of yours!

I'll begin by explaining
how to save your adventure.
Normally, you can open up
the Menu Screen by pressing
the <S> button. From there
you can select the 'File'
option, and simply follow
the directions to save.
However, when you are in a
town or a dungeon, you can
only save at designated
Memory Cube areas. Without
a Cube you cannot save!

To make a long story short...
This bobbing, spinning thing is
a 'Memory Cube', right!? You
must be cool, calm and collected
to superimpose yourself with it
and boldly open the Menu Screen.
If you accomplish that you will
be able to save successfully.
You should always save without
hesitation whenever you find
one of these in the dungeon.
In life, you can never tell
what may lie around the corner! 

So, what do you think?
You understood everything
perfectly, then!?
Okay, well I gotta...
Wha?
You didn't understand?
Aww gee... Well alright,
let me explain once more!

Alright, this time, make
sure you're listening then!
This spinning and bobbing
thing here is the Memory
Cube I just spoke about.
Fearlessly stand inside of
the Cube's area and calmly
and composedly open up the
Menu Screen! From there you
will be able to save into a
memory file as per normal.
Especially in dungeons and
other like areas, as soon
as you see one of these,
you should save without
hesitation. You never can
tell what may happen next!
When outside on the World
Map, you can save anywhere
you like (... probably)!
If you don't want to wind
up crying later, make sure
you save frequently, okay!?

So, that's it for
my concise summary!
You took it all in this
time, didn't you...?
Well, even a 2 year old
Dongarian Monkey could
understand my fantastic
explanation 120%, right!?

Hooh-ho-ho!
I'm such a genius!!

And now, about the
explanation fee...
Ha-haa! Just kidding...
You didn't think the great
Lucca would be that mean
did you?
This time I'll give you a
special deal and let you
have that one for free!

And you owe me 28G!
Don't forget that, okay!?

Alright, now for the
explanation fee...
it's 28G!
28G is a bargain considering
you were able to receive
such a perfect explanation
from the likes of me!!!
So c'mon, drop the excuses.
Be a man and pay up!

Had 28G taken from you!

Yes, thank you so much...
No receipts given though!

What the...!?
You don't even have 28G?
I guess I have no choice...
You'll have to owe me then.
Don't forget, you now owe
me 28G! You got that, Fei?

Owe Lucca 28G!

What!?
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me, the
one and only great Lucca,
can only do you good...!
... No matter how many
times you listen to it!
Oh, what a waste! Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

What!?
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me, the
one and only great Lucca,
can only do you good...!
... How will you ever know
unless you hear it out!
Oh, what a waste! Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

Oh, and you owe me 28G!
You haven't forgotten
that have you, Fei?
I'm not going to let you
get off so easily if you're
trying to get out of paying
your debt. You got that!?

Did you know that you can
spin the world around with
the L1 and R1 buttons!?
I'm sure you'll see things
you weren't able to before!
Explore the world by using
your own eyes and ears!
That is how you make the
gains in your life truly
your own!
If you're lost, then be
lost! There is no need to
rush, is there? Nor do you
have to explore the world
using someone else's maps!

I come here often to talk
to the village consultant.
He usually gives good advice.
Although, once in a while
he can be a little absent-
minded...
Just recently, he mixed-up
the love potion with the
balding potion...

Hehe... Yes, sir!
Whatever you say!

We'll have to continue
this conversation later!

But then again, we're out

Lahan Village - RPS Guy's House - 0620
———————————————————————————————————

Rock!!

Scissors!!

Paper!!

Wife
Sigh... 
My husband's love for the
rock-paper-scissors, or
'RPS' game is ruining us...
Just recently, he even said
he had a dream of receiving
the hero title from the
'RPS King'...
If only someone could
utterly defeat him to
make him see reality...
But he's just so good...

Husband
Yo! You want to play
rock-paper-scissors?
It's 50G per challenge.
    Let's do it!
    No thanks!

What the...?
Ya don't even have 50G!
Come back and talk to me
when ya have money, OK!

Argh... I can't afford
to lose the next turn.
This time I'm getting
serious... Ready?

Tisk... Lost three times
in a row! Not bad, Fei.
But, it's not over yet.

We're just getting started!
Are you ready to 'rock'!?

Yeah, that's the way, Fei!
If ya manage to beat me 5
times in a row, I'll give
ya a special reward!

I need some kind of risk
to make things interesting
against such an amateur.
Hehehe...

Here we go!

One, two...
    Rock
    Scissors
    Paper 

Rock!!

Whoa, you did rock too!?
Not bad! Not bad!
Let's do it again...

Scissors!!

Aww no, rock!?

Darn, you got me!
I can't believe this!
Aarrgh...!!

Paper!!

Rock!?
You did rock?

Muahaha.
Are you serious?
Yesss! I win!!
Ah-hahaha...!!

Rock!!

Scissors!
You did scissors!?

Yesss! I win! 
I did it baby! 
You can kiss my...!!

Scissors!!

Hey, you did scissors too, huh?
Hmmm... So that's how you play?
Anyway, here we go again...

Paper!!

Doh! Scissors?
You did scissors!?

Uuuaaahh! I, I lost!
How could this be!! 
What a snot!

Rock!!

What the!? Paper!?
Paper!?

Me? Lose!? 
This's ridiculous...!
Oh-my-gobrino!

Grraaaaahhh!!
I lost to an amateur!?
M, me...!? MEEEEEEEE...!!

Received 50G.

Guh!? I lost 4 in a row!?
How could I...!?
This is not good!!
If I lose the next one...!!

...
......
It's over...

I give up. I completely
lost to you, Fei.
It just goes to show that
I need more training.

Uuuhh... I give up!
It's my loss, Fei.
Here, as promised
I'll give you this!

Fei received the
'Mythical RPS Hero Badge'!!
Although, no one has any
idea what use it has...

Wife
I see you've beaten my husband!
Well, this should stifle some
of his manic love for the game.
But now I see you've come to
have a passion for RPS too!

———————————————————————————————————

Scissors!!

Oh, paper!
You did paper!?

Yesss! I win, so pay up!
Hallebalooyah! Boy...
that was too easy!!

Gyahahahaha!! Too bad, Fei!
You're 100 years too early
to even try to win 5 in row!!

Lost 50G.

———————————————————————————————————

Paper!!

Oh my, you did paper too.
Hmmm, well I see...
Here we go again...

———————————————————————————————————

Here...!! Hey! 
You were late!!
You cheezy cheater!!
Only cowards do that.
The penalty's 15G.
C'mon, cough up!

Lost 15G.

Tch! Ya don't even have 15G!
What are ya, a pauper? Boy!

Humph. 
Well, see ya later then.

Lahan Village - Elder's Home - 0622
———————————————————————————————————

This town may be hidden
away deep within the
mountains without anything
else... But, I still love
it...Lahan.

Well if it isn't Fei.
Isn't it exciting to know
that Timothy's wedding is
going to be tomorrow?
I think it's time you
found a wonderful girl
like Alice yourself.
Hah hah.

By the way, Fei. What
do you think of Lahan?
    I like it
    I don't dislike it...

Fei
"Lahan...I like it.
The village leader,
Chief Lee, has taken
such good care of me...
Everyone in the village
has warmly accepted
me..."

Fei
"Regardless of where I may
have been born and raised,
Lahan is now my home."

Ah, yes. It makes me
happy to just hear that.

Here, take this as an
allowance. Don't squander
it all at once.

Received 120G!

———————————————————————————————————

Fei
"I don't dislike Lahan.
The people here are good
people."

Fei
"But, someday, I'd really
like to leave and find my
true home...
To walk upon the land I
was born on, I want to meet
those who've known me...
I want to know who
my true self is."

Fei
"As it is now, it feels
like there's some kinda
empty void within me..."

That's unfortunate.
But I'm sure there are
people out there waiting
for your return...

If the day comes and
that happens, think about
us once in a while and
remember our village.

Fei
"Of course. 
I'd never forget."

But let's forget that
for now. That won't come
along for a while.
It's not good for an elder
like me to be so hasty,
hah hah.

Lahan Village - Bar - 0624
———————————————————————————————————

Barkeep
"Aaarh, Fei!
That's the back door!
Go around and come in
through the front door!"

Man
Have you heard the
latest rumors!?
It's said that, in the
southern desert of Aveh
there is buried treasure
all over the place!
There's hundreds of
people who are trying
to strike it rich by
digging everywhere!
A single strike could 
make you totally rich.

But then again, you
never can tell how
much is the truth...
In life, if it sounds
too good to be true,
it usually is. Bah.

Barkeep
"Hey, it's Fei.
How's it going?
I ain't got any drinks
for kids, ya know! 
Come back when you're
older, alright!!?"

Ellen
Oh my! Welcome Fei...
You wanna have some fun?
I give the best service
in Lahan, you know!?

Barkeep
"Hey, Ellen!
Quit teasing the
innocent kid!"

Ellen
Yeah, yeah! I know!
It's just a joke...
you blockhead!

Gee, he's got sharp
hearing! Anyway...
(Maybe next time, okay,
Fei!? I'll be waiting...
Rowrrr!)

Barkeep
"Here's a tip, Fei.
Be very cautious of
alcohol and women.
Behind those sweet and
beautiful appearances
lies a deep, dark swamp.
Before you realize it,
you are trapped, and
lose your freedom.
They are the most
fearsome demons
in this world."

Old Man
Hmmm...!!
Young one, beware!
I can see it...
There is a dark and
icy wind that blows
where you are going.
A wind that nurtures
grief and resentment,
inviting death from
which there is no
salvation...
No one will be able
to escape from it!
But you, and only you,
must eventually face
up to that dark wind!

... Just kidding!
I've always wanted
to try saying that!
Did I scare you?
I'm really sorry!
Wahaha...

But in reality, these
premonitions of misfortune
tend to take on their own
shape once uttered.
You ought to be
prepared...
... Hah hah! Just kidding!
It's also a joke!
Don't let it get to you.

Instead of believing
what others say, you
should follow your
own path.
After all, your
fate will be what
you make of it.

But, do you want to hear
my prediction again? Eh?
    Yeah, from the top!
    No, enough already!

Oh good!
That's the spirit!
Well, here goes...
Are you ready?

———————————————————————————————————

How boring.
A guy like you will
never be popular.

———————————————————————————————————

Gramps always makes
things out to be
easier than they
really are!
It's actually quite
a tremendous feat
to get through that
Blackmoon Forest...
All those dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
live there...
I tell you, it's
better if you don't
go near the place!

South of here is the
'Blackmoon Forest'.
If you can make it through
there, you'll come to Aveh,
the great land of fire!
I shouldn't be wasting my
time here in this little
country village.
Why, I oughta go to Aveh
and work there...!
Beautiful women and good
liquor...
And if I work hard enough,
I'll be rich in no time!
Hehehe...
Wouldn't that be good!

Pay no attention to
the fool!
He's always saying all
this carefree stuff.
In reality, it's an
incredibly hard task
to get through the
Blackmoon Forest...
Lots of dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
make their home there!
It'd be better for
you to stay away
from there!

If you get through the
'Blackmoon Forest' to
the south of here, you
will find the kingdom of
fire, 'Aveh'.
Instead of just wasting
away here in this little
mountain village, I should
go have some fun in Aveh!
Beautiful girls, tasty
liquor...
Why, a gentleman like
myself is bound to draw
the babes wherever I go!
Haw-haw-haw...
Wouldn't that be good!

Drunk Man
You gotta problem with
me, hic, drinkin' at
midday? How can I not be
drinkin'... Damn it...

Nobody knows...
In the depths...
of the sea...
a tear...drop...
shed by...
a mermaid...
It's not some dream...
You idiots...
Hic...

You got a problem, boy?
    No... Go, go, go for it!!
    Yeah... I hate drunks!
    Drinking won't help matters!

Hya hah hah...
I like you, boy! Now go
away and leave me alone.

Hah!
The feeling's mutual...
I hate nosy people!
Since we both hate each
other, why don't you just
leave me alone then, eh?

Shut up! 
What would you know!?
You don't know how I
feel. I wouldn't want
you to know. Damn it...

No...
Wait up, boy!

I'll give you this.
Take it.

Fei
"???
What is that?"

I have no use for it...
Don't worry 'bout it.
Just take it.

Nobody knows...
In the depths...
of the sea...
a tear...drop...
shed by...
a mermaid...

Received a 'Mermaid Tear'!

Fei
"Hmmm...
Well, whatever."

Fei
"Well then,
thanks for this."

Young Man
My, that drunk had the
most beautiful stone!
Hmmm...
I wonder what it was?

There he goes again...
How could there be a
mermaid in the middle
of the sea of sand?

Fei
"Sea of sand...?"

Young Man
What's this, Fei?
You've never seen
the sea of sand?
This is what the
sea of sand is...
It's a vast, swirling,
bottomless desert.
More than half the world
is this sea of sand.
I'm surprised you haven't
heard anything about it.

I wouldn't need anything
else if I could only live
together with my family.
Just the three of us...
Why can't men understand
something so simple...

...I wonder how
he's doing...
Aveh's so far...

Lahan Village - Outside Alice's House - 0618

Why, hello Fei.
Are you here
to see Alice?

Actually, it's customary
that we don't let any men
in to see the bride today...
But, you can be an exception.

———————————————————————————————————
Lahan Village - Alice's House - 0628

Alice's Aunt
"Why hello, Fei. Have you
come to visit our Alice?
She's upstairs right now.

Alice's Aunt
"But doesn't time fly...?
It has already been ten
years since my brother
and his wife passed away.
We did our best to raise
the two children in their
place..."

Alice's Aunt
"But now, as far as
Alice is concerned,
I can finally say my
job is done.
I know Timothy will
take good care of
her from here on...
Now all that's left
is Dan...
I'm going to have a
hard time raising
him to adulthood."

Sigh...

Alice's Aunt
"Tomorrow, please pray
for Alice's happiness.
And, from here on as well,
I want you to stay the best
of friends with both Alice
and Timothy. Thanks, Fei!"

Lahan Village - Alice's Room - 0630

Fei
"Hello, Alice.
Is that your
wedding dress?"

Alice
"Oh!?
Fei, you startled me!"

Alice
"Yes it is...
I just finished it. It took
more work than I expected."

Fei
"Hmmm...
You did a great job there!
It'll look wonderful
on you, Alice...
Congratulations."

Alice
"Thank you.
..."

Alice
"..."

Fei
"Hey, uh, Alice..."

Alice
"Oh, um, Fei..."

Fei
"What is it?"

Alice
"Oh, nothing..."

Fei
"I see..."

Alice
"Um...
Oh yes, that's right..."

Alice
"Fei, 
have you seen Dan?"

Fei
"Yeah, he's outside...
bragging as always."

Alice
"Ugh, that kid!
I just told him that I had
an errand for him to run!"

Fei
"Oh yeah?
What kind of errand?"

Alice
"It's for my wedding
ceremony tomorrow...
I was hoping he could go
borrow a camera and some
lights from Doctor Uzuki,
up on the mountain peak."

Fei
"If that's all it is,
I'll be glad to do it
for you."

Alice
"Could you?
Oh, but I couldn't
possibly..."

Fei
"Don't worry!
It's no problem!
Anyway, it doesn't exactly
make me feel comfortable
having Dan handle such
delicate instruments.
What's more, I might have
a chance to eat some of
Yui's cooking if I go to
the doc's place."

Alice
"Hee-hee...
That's my Fei!"

Fei
"Well, I'll go up there
now and get them for you!"

Alice
"Oh...
Fei, wait!"

Fei
"Huh...? Is there
something else you want
me to get from Citan?"

Alice
"No...
It's not that..."

Fei
"... ?"

Alice
"Fei...
Have you ever thought
about things this way?"

Alice
"If... If, you had
only been born in
this village...
And if we had only
known each other
earlier on..."

Fei
"..."

Alice
"...
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm sorry..."

Fei
"...
Well, I think I had
better get going now!"

Alice
"Oh, OK...
Be careful on that
mountain path.
And give my regards
to Doctor Uzuki!"

Alice
"...
Is this fate...?"

Alice
"I feel so foolish...
Who am I kidding?"
