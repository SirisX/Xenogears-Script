...Sigh... Will the day
ever come when I will be
able to live peacefully
on the surface?

Man
Yeah, that was an
incredible battle.
Thanks to you all, we're
somehow still here.
Thank you so much. We're
depending on you till
the day we bring freedom
back to the surface.

Crew 1
It's a small world.
I already remember all
the land, sea and air!!

Crew 2
Shevat's communication decoder,
charts of angular cordinates of
the radio wave lighthouse and
it's pulses, table of guidance
communication code settings...
There're so many things we
need to buy.
Things have gotten a lot more
complicated and expensive,
now that we can fly!

Crew 3
...Wingtip-stalls...
hammerhead-stalls...
the Helpst maneuver...
grumble... grumble...

Crew 4
...In short, it flies
cause it has wings, right?
This is hard to understand!

Crew 5
So how's the status of
our ammo supplies...
Hmm, maybe we need more
anti-aircraft shells...

Crew 6
I hope Jerico doesn't go
learning any more strange
things ever again...

Sigurd
"We are currently
anchored at Shevat..."
    Leave Shevat.
    Changed my mind.

Bart
"Our Yggdrasil was reborn
with Shevat technology.
This vessel will be
named 'the Third'!"

Sigurd
"The operations are a
bit different from the
previous Yggdrasil.
So you'll have to
learn the workings
all over again!"

Bingo
Yes!
I'll do my best!

the residents either.)

(Where'd all the
townsfolk go to?)

Chu-Chu

townspeople go chu?)

Maria
(And I don't see
any civilians.)

————————————————————————————

Citan
(It was said that there
is a hidden shelter
facility in the town...
But whether it was safe
in there or not is
another problem...!)

————————————————————————————
-ALT-

Elly
(I heard there is a hidden
shelter. But do you think
they're alright in there?)

Billy
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but I wonder if
it was safe in there?)

Rico
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but do you
think it was safe?)

Chu-Chu
(It's going chu be alright!
There's a secret hole.
That's what I heard chu.)

Maria
(I've been informed that
there was an emergency
shelter facility.
Do you suppose they
took refuge there?)

————————————————————————————

Fei
(Yeah, I think I heard Bart
say something about that.
So you think the townsfolk
went there?)

Fei
(How was it on your side?)

Sigurd
(The side roads are also
similarly quiet.)

Fei
(I see.
So, what now...?)

Sigurd
(Hmm, just from what little
I've seen I can't tell what
their next move might be.
But, we can't just leave...
considering the residents
were placed in danger
because of our treasure.)

Fei
(Okay, agreed.
But by the way, is
Margie doing alright?)

Sigurd
(Well, about that...
The young master is quite
concerned that Marguerite
has tagged along.)

Maria
(How can you blame her?
I kind of know what Margie
may be going through.
She probably can't stand
to just sit around.)

Sigurd
(Yes, but you know him...)

Sigurd
(Well, I should get going.
We'll coordinate our
moves according to yours
and try to break through
the rear path.)

Citan
(Let us just pray
for success.)

Fei
(Yeah.)

Citan
(But now that we have heard
and seen so many things up
until now...
We should realize that
Shakhan's existence is
no longer just the young
one's problem.
If we do not stop Shakhan
and his men here, the next
time it may be us who face
such a misfortune.
Let us brace ourselves and
help these people out!)

Fei
(Okay then, let's go!)

————————————————————————————
-ALT- Bart

Bart
(They're probably in
the hidden shelter.)

Bart
(I dunno, but I'd like
to think that everything
is still okay.)

Bart
(How was it over
on your side?)

Sigurd
(Everywhere along the
roads was also just as
quiet.)

Bart
(... What's your
take on this, Sig?)


Sigurd
(From what little I've
seen, there isn't anything
much I can say.)

Bart
(Either they haven't 
found what they are
looking for yet...
Or they've already found
what they were looking for
but have just left behind
some guards...
Either way, we still need
to check on the safety
of the residents before we
even think of pulling out.
Hey, by the way, how is
Margie holding up?)

Sigurd
(From the looks of it, she
doesn't seem much different
from her usual self...
But how she feels on the
inside... well, who's to
know...)

Bart
(Really... Thanks for
looking after her, Sig.)

Sigurd
(No problem.
Anyway I shall go and
command the other unit.)

Bart
(Alright. Be careful!)

Bart
(Margie...
I thought I told her to
stay put in our ship.)

Bart
(Yeah, I know but...
Well, she's come this far,
so we can't stop her now.)

who were in the town."

Nisan - Overworld - 0794
————————————————————————————

    With the help of Fei and his
    colleagues, Nisan was freed
        from Shakhan's army.
     However, the Fatima Jasper
     and the legendary treasures
       of the Aveh royal family
        were still in danger.
     And now, he's going to play
     his last card and Shakhan's
       true intentions will be
          brought to light.

Margie
"You okay?
Sister, are you wounded?"

Sister Agnes
"I'm fine. 
Marguerite and Bartholomew,
I'm sorry..."

Sigurd
"I took some troops and
searched the area, but I
couldn't find anyone."

Bart
"Really?"

Sister Agnes
"Earlier, 
after everyone came out..."

Sister Agnes
"Over half of the
residents have fled
from Nisan.
After that, Shakhan's
position in the country
was compromised so...
he didn't care about
reputations anymore and
attacked this land."

Citan
"I see. 
A last desperate plan to
reverse the situation..."

Bart
"Sister, I assume the
people remaining in the
town are...?"

Sister Agnes
"Yes. 
Hiding in the mausoleum."

Fei
"Mausoleum...?
Hiding in a grave?"

Margie
"The Great Mothers and
Kings of Aveh of old
are revered there."

Bart
"It's not just some regular
grave or anything."

Sister Agnes
"Bartholomew,
about that..."

Sister Agnes
"Shakhan and
the Fatima Jasper...
He's after the Fatima
Treasure."

Citan
"Treasure...? If he
wants the treasure what is
he doing attacking here..."

Bart
"Huh? Ahh..."

Bart
"Actually, the Fatima
Treasure is in the
mausoleum.
There was even father's
will there, but I didn't
tell anyone..."

Fei
"Treasure...
You mean that thing in the
picture scrolls you showed
me earlier in your base?"

Bart
"Yeah.
If you follow that legend,
you're supposed to get
your hands on some great
power."

Sigurd
"We must stop them
somehow."

Bart
"There's no problem.
The Jasper is..."

Sister Agnes
"They plan to use the
former Mother's retinas."

Bart
"Wha...what!!"

Sister Agnes
"Remove the deceased
Mother's retina, and
break the seal."

Bart
"Use the body of Margie's
mother?"

Margie
"Mom's...!!"

Sister Agnes
"I'm sorry. They used
innocent citizens and sect
followers as a shield.
There was no other way...
The truth we heard
previously from Margie
about the Jasper's true
form and how it's used.
They know now...
I am truly sorry."

Bart
"Well...
I don't blame you.
They had hostages!"

Citan
"Wait a moment.
Retinas...what are you
speaking of?"

Bart
"The Fatima Jasper is the
topaz blue pupils of the
Fatima dynasty...
In other words...
our retinal pattern.
The doors to the treasure
are opened by that...
Or so it is said."

Bart
"However no one has ever
used it. It's not to be
used for minor conflicts.
The doors are to be opened
only when the kingdom is
truly in danger.
So neither I, 
nor my father, 
nor grandfather,
nor my great grandfather
have ever used it."

Citan
"So, that is the true
form of the Jasper..."

Bart
"Damn!"

Bart
"That old coot, he wants to
profane a holy person's
corpse? That's unthinkable!"

Citan
"It is a closely guarded
secret but the 'Ethos'
people are not holy men.
They simply supervise."

Fei
"Yes, of course they
wouldn't feel anything!
Let's go Bart!
Before the mausoleum is
trashed."

Bart
"Alright!"

Sigurd
"Young master!
I have a proposal."

Bart
"What is it Sig?"

Sigurd
"Currently Aveh is in
confusion with Shakhan
running amok.
It should be very easy
to bring down the center
with no Gebler units
around.
It'll be the best time to
make our return to the
capital."

Citan
"That is a good idea.
Shakhan is most likely
thinking of the Fatima
Jasper as his last card.
While we prevent the young
one from handing over the
treasure to Shakhan...
a separate force will take
back the capital.
Then he will have nowhere
else to go."

Bart
"I got it...
Sounds good.
We can pay everything
back in one shot!"

Bart
"Let's split up!
I'll go to the mausoleum.
I'll take Fei and..."

Fei
"Well, let's get goin'.
Where's this mausoleum?"

Bart
"There's an entrance at
the rear of the cathedral.
So first of all, we have to
get on the road that runs
around this town and go in
through the back way."

Elly
"Do we have to
walk that far?"

Bart
"The distance to the
mausoleum isn't that
much...
But, I don't know
how much more there
is to go from there."

Fei
"You haven't been inside
there yourself Bart?"

Bart
"Yeah...
This is my first time to go
beyond the mausoleum too."

Margie
"Well, the place is all
sealed up. Even I haven't
been far inside of it."

Bart
"So neither Margie nor
I know much about it.
Sig and them have already
taken off, so we won't be
able to return to the ship
for a while.
For now, we're just gonna
have to work this out on
our own."

Margie
"Alright then, I'm going
to go on ahead and wait
for you at the entrance."

Bart
"We'll come once we
finish our preparations.
So could you wait for
us at the entrance
until then?"

Margie
"Okay!"

Bart
"Alright...
let's get prepped."

Fei
"But, by the looks of it,
I don't think we'll be able
to find the tool lady."

Bart
"Hmm... Why don't we just
leave the necessary money
behind then?
Sure it might not be good
manners, but I'm sure they
will forgive me..."

Yes, somehow...

"Shakhan...
Where did he go!?"

Man 1
Oh yes, Shakhan?
No, I haven't seen him...
The only people that came
here were those soldiers
that threatened me to
stay quiet...
I'm sorry laddie.
If only I'd been braver.

"He isn't here yet

It's OK to go back!"

Is that true!?

Man 2
Bartholomew,
you're indeed powerful.
I've seen you come and go
from time to time and I
didn't think much of it.
Exactly who are you?

Man 1
...!

Bart
"Everyone, I need your
attention! My..."

Bart
"...My friends are
currently headed for
Bledavik.
They're on a mission to
take down Shakhan from
his seat of power."

"There is a need to
rebuild this country from
scratch again.
I've, I've
inherited that task from
our late king."

"If all goes well, we'll
soon be able to make
it a reality.
Please, believe me,
and wait for me."

king...?

Laddie,
be careful out there!
I know you'll make it ok.
And when you do...
you have to promise that
you'll come out and
announce who you are.
I want to see you stand
on the terrace of Castle
Fatima, proudly!

You gotta win lad.
You've got my support!

is no light."

That explains the moldy
smell."

Billy

why it smells like mold..."

Mausoleum Angel Statue - 1568

Fei
"This is...
the same angel statue at
the cathedral."

Bart
"So this is the door that
connects to the great
royal treasure."

Bart
"It's time for
the Fatima Jasper...
to do its thing...
Oh yeah, one of mine's
closed."

Margie
"I'm here."

Fei
"The...
Fatima Jasper."

Bart
"Yeah.
That punk, Shakhan
mistook that for the
royal pendant."

Bart
"But that made it
easier for us, so I kept
my mouth shut."

Fei
"What's up ahead...?"

Margie
"Up ahead will be the
central core of the
fortress."

Margie
"It's been said that if
we shine that mysterious
light across our eyes,
the fortress will rise
to the surface.
They say this was built
before the country of
Aveh was founded.
So, you ready to go?"

Mausoleum Computer Room - 1570
————————————————————————————

Bart
"There sure are a lot
of gauges and meters in
here."

Margie
"I wonder which is more
impressive? The pilot
room on your ship or the
one in here?"

Bart
"My ship of course..."

Bart
"Uhh, well... since they
are our ancestors, I
guess this one's better."

Bart
"And you, quit asking
mean questions like that.
Anyway, it's not called
a pilot room. It's the
bridge, got it?"

Margie
"Does it really matter?"

————————————————————————————

Bart
"...Not moving."

Elly
"I think it's locked."

"Hmm..."

Margie
"Want to go check out the
great treasure first?"

Bart
"Hmmm...
From the looks of it,
Shakhan hasn't found the
great treasure either."

Fei
"Yeah...
When we were leaving 
Nisan, Bart and them said
they've never been here.
Well, first of all let's
go locate the great
treasure."

Bart
"Yeah...
I know for sure that the
great treasure is
somewhere inside the
mausoleum. I can't
pinpoint the location
though.
So, let's go find it
then we can decide what
to do next."

Mausoleum 2nd Jasper Lock - 1580

"There's another Jasper
lock..."

Margie
"Let's try it out."

————————————————————————————
Mausoleum Central Chamber - 1588
————————————————————————————

Elly
"For being in storage for
so long, this thing's in
great condition!"

Fei
"... It kinda looks
a lot like Bart's Gear."

Bart
"Huh?
Oh yeah...
Now that you mention it...
Well, if you trace my
Brigandier's history, it
was a Gear originaly made
in Aveh, that I customized.
It wouldn't surprise me if
there was some connection."

Bart
"Yeah well...
Looks like there's no power
drawn here except for the
emergency lights."

Fei
"This Gear too...
No power in the lights."

Fei
"The drive unit's been
sealed..."

Bart
"Hmm.
There might be something
around here."

————————————————————————————
-AFTER- Trying control panels

Bart
"Hmm.
The control panels down
there didn't do much...
Meaning there's probably
something around here."

————————————————————————————

Bart
"...?"

Bart
"Something's written here."

Bart
"Does anyone have a light?"

Bart
"This...
There's an inscription.
It's in old Fatima.
......It's my
ancestors'."

Margie
"What does it say?"
 
     "Peace to all those
        who come here.
   Fearing great calamity,
    we sealed this legacy,
 entrusting its fate to you." 

Bart
"OK, this should work."

————————————————————————————
-ALT-

Bart
"All right, this should
work."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Now, how do I get it
out?"

Fei
"You said it would appear
above if it read the eyes.
You think you can move this
building?"

Bart
"No. That last room
looked like a bridge.
Let's check it out!"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Margie
"Now, how am I going to
get this out?"

Bart
"Yeah."

Bart
"Okay, let's go back
downstairs and try it."

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Father, looks like we're
gonna have to move this.
Sorry, but I'll have to
borrow it."

Ft. Jasper Ship Bridge - 1572

"We've surfaced!
Next open the sky dome."

Bart
"...Huh?"

Bart
"What?"

Fei
"What's up?"

Bart
"Huh? No,
it's already moving."

Elly
"You moved it?"

Bart
"No.
That's not why."

Bart
"No doubt...
it's something...
I accidentally pushed."

"............"

Bart
"Yesss!
This is the way!!"


"Oh REALLY!?"


Bart
"Wha?
What're you talking
about?"

Fei
"Quit foolin'!
What the heck did you
just press!?"

Bart
"...Ohhh...
Well, I wouldn't say it
was a complete success...
but it'll do for now."

Elly
"A really bright light
just shot out.
...Did you just do
something you shouldn't
have done?"

Bart
"Don't worry!
I've  never fouled things
up yet, have I?
Well have I!?"

Bart
"How 'bout... Ladies and
gentlemen, behold!"

Bart
"Tis that not Babel Tower
...over yonder?"

Bart
"Well?
Isn't it way coooool!?
It floats from the Fatima
Jasper...
I call it Ft. Jasper, and
you'll be able see it from 
far off.
I'm sure that last beam
cannon could reach it!"

Bart
"Well, I guess I wanted to
show you all its greatness.
Have you ever seen such a
cannon? And don't mix it
up with Vanderkaum's pea-
shooter. This one's many 
times more powerful and
many times more refined.
After all, that's why my
ancestors used it for
generations to guard the
treasure.
Yeah, this is the real
thing. And don't you
forget it.
Now as I was saying,
I haven't fouled up yet."

Bart
"So, let's go get this
treasure and go home!
But first, we have to
open that door in the
dome!
I don't think the switch
on this control panel
will do it though."

Bart
"Over there!"

Elly
...

Fei
(Didn't you say you hit
the wrong button earlier?)

Bart
"Hey, they all look alike.
Ah well, let's start
hitting some buttons."

Fei
"Whoa whoa!
Is that safe!?"

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Alright, let's
hurry up and get the
treasure outside."

Shakhan
Well done, Prince
Bartholomew.
Thank you for unlocking
the seal.

Bart
"That voice,
Shakhan!"

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Damn you!
This was all a setup!?"

Shakhan
"Of course."

Shakhan
"You don't really believe
that the door would open
up for just anyone?
I simply leaked the
information and merely
awaited for your arrival."

Bart
"Crap, so that's why I
haven't noticed your
stench for a while!"

Shakhan
"Knowing your impulsive
nature, I knew you would
come...
But I never thought you'd
go so far as breaking the
seal for me."

Bart
"Son of a...
Makin' a fool outta me!"

Shakhan
"My soldiers have already
secured this area.
If you don't like it,
come here and get some!
Hah hah hah!"

Mausoleum Hallway - 1578
————————————————————————————

Bart
"One after the other...
Don't these guys give up?"

Shakhan
"Most impressive, Prince
Bartholomew.
But you'll go no further."

Bart
"The central area's gone.
What can you do now?
How about killing yourself
honorably?
What a fitting death
for a clergyman."

Shakhan
"There's much more to
the 'Ethos' than you
would know.
We're not a single unit.
We each have an agenda.
We have no need to admit
defeat just because the
central area's gone.
I have my own motives.
And it is for them, that
I used Aveh and Gebler.
Now, the treasure's mine.
I suggest you retreat now."

Bart
"...Crap!"

Bart
"Margie!"

Shakhan (-ERROR-??? No name here)
"After her!"

Shakhan
"Hmph...
You're actually trying
to protect the Omnigear?
What do you think one
little girl can do?
As they say, out of the
frying pan and into the
fire...idiot!"

Shakhan
"I'm going to take care
of this once and for all!
That detestable girl has
made a fool of me for the
last time. I'll send her
and everything with her
to the depths of hell."

Bart
"Dammit...
Get the hell outta
my way!"

Sigurd

I was worried about you
so I returned here."

Sigurd
"Shakhan,
it's only a matter of
time until Bledavik
returns to us.
At this point, you have
nowhere to go."

Shakhan
"Errrgh...
It's not over yet!
I've still got Margie.
For now, she'll once
again be my hostage
until I get that
Omnigear."

Bart
"Wait!"

"Damn, it won't open!
It's locked on the inside."

"Just do it!"

Margie
"My leg...got shot.
Heh...looks like I'm
causing you trouble again."

Bart
"Stupid!
Why'd you put yourself
in danger like that!?"

Margie
"I...it wasn't much,
I just thought this is the
least I could do for you."

Bart
"...Dumb...
Stupid!
You're the
biggest fool!"

Margie
"...heh, heh."

Bart
"...Can you move?"

Margie
"Uh huh...I guess."

Shakhan
"Minor damage can be
repaired.
Aim for the cockpit!"

Bart
"Dammit!"

Bart
"It's too dangerous to go
outside now.
Can you hold on?"

Margie
"Don't worry
about me."

Bart
"...Damn!"

Bart
"Wha, what the!?
There's no control stick!
How am I gonna move this?"

"Are you okay,
young master!?"

Bart
"...Sig!?
Ya know how to operate
this thing?"

Sigurd
"...What do you mean!?"

Bart
"There are no controls!
What am I gonna do?"

Bart
"Uuuaaaaahh!"

Shakhan
"Impudent little..."

Bart
"H, how!?
How'd it move!?"

"I got it!
Young one, you must think!"

Bart
"That voice... Citan!?"

Citan
"Apparently, the Omnigear
does not function by
mechanical controls, but
mental ones.
Remember how Elly and the
Omnigear in Shevat
responded?"

Bart
"...But..."

Citan
"Margie probably moved it
through the same means.
Young one, try and
envision the Gear moving.
Then the Gear should react
to the image in your head."

Bart
"Now that I know...
...here goes!"

Citan
"Fortunately, the bullet
passed through. I will
apply some first aid.
Later, when we return to
the city, we should have
it looked over thoroughly."

Bart
"Good...I'm glad.
When she passed out I
thought the worst."

Margie
"...Bart."

Bart
"...How ya feelin'?"

Margie
"...Okay.
You know, when I
passed out, I still heard
your voice.
For some strange reason...
your cries reached me.
That's why I thought I had
to help you..."

Bart
"...Oh.
We were fighting together
weren't we? You 
protected me."

Bart
"But, is this
really the legendary Gear
in the scroll of our
founding nation?"

Bart
"The way it handles,
it feels just like my
Brigandier...
...Except maybe it's
a little more powerful."

Citan
"Perhaps...
The controls, output and
weapons are similar and
adjust to the strength of
the pilot's mental waves."

Citan
"If so, the pilot must be
skilled at mentally merging
with the Gear to gain its
true power.
Marguerite was able to move
the Gear through her strong
desire to help you.
It was her strength
that moved it."

Bart
"Meaning, I'd have to get
used to it?"

Citan
"That would be the case."

Bart
"Ergh. I already
went through a lot of
trouble getting it..."

Citan
"Do not be discouraged.
We now know that these
Omnigears were used in the
battle between the land
and Solaris.
Even now, the 'Ethos' and
Solaris are seeking the
Omnigears.
At least, this one did not
fall into their hands.
Eventually, you will be
able to unleash its power.
Let us hope you use it
for the right reasons."
