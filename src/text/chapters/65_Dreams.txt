Dreams... - Citan in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

God...the inter-planetary
invasion weapon -Deus-...
had awakened and its ark,
 
Merkava
 
was activated.

Deus began to absorb,
one after the other,
the mutated people,
destined to be its parts...
 
While the non-mutated,
would eventually,
only become a threat to it.
To exterminate us
and our civilization...
 
it set into action.

The planet's surface
was devastated...
 
...by Merkava
and the weapons born
from out of it, called...
 
'the -Seraph- angels'.

————————————————————————————

While pursuing
the newly awakened Deus,
we chanced upon Fei,
whose whereabouts
had hitherto been lost...
 
Along with his Gear,
Weltall...
 
Discovered together
at the place where 'Merkava'
was originally located...

We were overjoyed by
Fei's return...but
it was short lived...
 
For some unknown reason...
Fei was found in a state of
suspended animation.
 
He did not regain
consciousness.

The people of Shevat,
and we ourselves,
feared a relapse of
Fei's, no...
Id's power...
and had no choice
but to put Fei into...
 
'Carbonite Freeze'.

————————————————————————————

Citan
"...Your Majesty.
Why do the people of
Shevat fear Fei so much?
Even if Grahf and Id's
power are comparable..."

Zephyr
"...
It is not that
we fear him."

Zephyr
"We fear the error we
ourselves committed.
And now we are simply
trying to put a lid
on it..."

Citan
"The error that you
yourselves committed?"

Zephyr
"Shevat instigated a battle
500 years ago to gain our
independence from Solaris.
However, we became overcome
with the lust for power...
Fearing the war-torn
people's will would no
longer be with Shevat, but
with the Nisan Mother...
and that the people would
assemble under Sophia...
...the Council of Elders
of Shevat back then, made
a deal with Solaris."

Citan
"A deal?"

Zephyr
"Yes..."

Zephyr
"At the time, Solaris...
or the Gazel Ministry to
be exact...
...were at odds with a
woman who held the real
power behind the scenes."

Citan
"...Would that happen
to have been Miang?"

Zephyr
"Most probably it was."

————————————————————————————

Fearing the increasing power
of the masses assembling in
Nisan, the Gazel Ministry
schemed to hand over to us
their antagonist, Miang, and
promised a division of the
rulership over the earth's
surface.
 
But in exchange...
 
We had to give them the rebel
army that had assembled in
Nisan and also their patron,
Sophia...

————————————————————————————

Zephyr
"The leaders of Shevat
accepted...
...and it was decided that
Nisan would be the location
of the final decisive
battle with Solaris."

Zephyr
"Shevat did not participate
in that battle...
Thwarted by the awesome
numbers of the Solarian
army, and with their path
of retreat cut off...
...the Nisan rebel army
ran out of options and
was destroyed...
Caught up in the middle
of all this was Lacan,
Bart's ancestor Roni,
myself... and 'Krelian'."

Citan
"You were also there?"

Zephyr
"Yes...
Surrounded on all sides...
we were prepared to die.
And then, the rebel
forces' flagship appeared
with Sophia on board.
She sacrificed herself
so as to create a path
for our retreat...
Sophia's ship headed
straight for the enemy's
main ship on a suicide
attack."

————————————————————————————
► Mini-CGI Cutscene - Sophia's Ship Crashing into Merkava
————————————————————————————

Zephyr
"Thanks to Sophia's
sacrifice, we were
able to survive.
However, her death
forever changed the
fate of two men..."

————————————————————————————

Krelian, who followed closely
under her as the leader of the
Nisan sect's militia, completely
lost faith after calling out to
a god that would not respond.
 
    "I will create god
    with my own hands!"
 
...were the last words he
uttered before he disappeared.

And Lacan...
 
He resented himself for
not having the power
to do anything while she
died in front of him...
 
...So he began to search
for the 'Legendary Power'.

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Legendary Power?"

Zephyr
"God's resting place, 
'Mahanon'... The source of
divine wisdom, 'Razael'...
And the 'Anima Relics'
which were created by
that very wisdom...
Besides these...
there is one more
legend."

Citan
"And that is?"

Zephyr
"'Zohar'..."

Citan
"Zohar!?
That has the same name as
the 'Zohar Modifier'...
...the power reactor that
Miang spoke of, saying it
was the infinite energy
source of god -Deus-...
What she claimed is also
the source of our Ether
powers and the driving
force of all our Gears."

Zephyr
"It would have to be one
and the same thing...
It is the place that
contains the ultimate
source of this world's
power.
It is said that only he
who has the correct
destiny would be able to
discover its location..."

Zephyr
"Losing all faith in
humanity, Lacan sought
after its power...
Lacan became Grahf...
and the world collapsed...
This tragedy happened
because of the people's
lust for power...
I must take part of the
responsibility for not
having been able to stop
it...
And now, Fei...
the one who has the same
power as Grahf...
We just wanted to seal
up that dreadful power
that arose from our own
sinful deeds..."

————————————————————————————

Grahf, the man once known
as Lacan, sought after
the 'Power of Zohar'...
 
  The one who has the same
  power as Grahf...Fei...
 
I had this premonition
that Fei too would awaken
and seek out that power.
 
And that presentiment
became reality.

Where...
Am I?
Who...
am I?

This is...

Doc...

Rico...

Billy...

Wiseman...

Grahf...

Elly?

Mother?

Who are you?

I'm surprised.
That's pretty clever.

You are...
Id?

I misjudged you.
I didn't expect you,
the fake personality,
would create a fourth
persona.

Fourth persona?

He can't feel anything.
He's shut up inside your
ego.
The pressing facts and
truths you won't face.
You're afraid of them, so
you desired to completely
shut yourself off from
the outside world.

And so you formed
a fourth persona.
A fourth 'Fei'.
The name...doesn't matter.
He's the one on the stage.
He's the one who's in
control of our body.
But it is a useless
form of resistance.

Come with me!

Wait!
What are
you doing?

He has the key.
I merely want
to borrow it.
I've got to
go somewhere.

Are you...
coming too?

Roni
"C'mon guys, eat up.
You haven't been able
to get this kinda food
around here lately,
have ya?" 

Roni
"Well, this is also due
to my business savvy."

Rene
"...What's wrong, Lacan?
You look kinda down.
What's bothering you?
Are you worried about
something?"

Lacan
"It's nothing...
I'm just thinking about
painting Sophia.
I don't know why I agreed 
to do her portrait..."

Rene
"Sophia... You mean your
childhood friend who's now
the Holy Mother of Nisan?"

Lacan
"She's not really a
childhood friend...
...I just made her
acquaintance at the
monastery near my home
when I was a child...
She went to the clinic
there for convalescence."

Lacan
"She was frail."

Rene
"So...
what are you worried
about painting her for?"

Lacan
"She does not wish 
herself to become a 
symbol of her sect.
...Actually, it seems
she wasn't interested
in having her portrait
painted at first.
But, when she heard I
would be the painter,
she turned around and
agreed.
That's what I don't
understand..."

Roni
"I see..."

Roni
"Then she must
like you..."

Lacan
"What are you
talking about?"

Roni
"That's how women are...
Right, Krelian...?"

Roni
"Hey, Krel!"

Krelian
"Huh?"

Rene
"...What's up?
You're not having any?
It's ready to eat."

Krelian
"Ah, yeah..."

Roni
"The Holy Mother
of Nisan, huh?
What, are you out
to offend divine
providence or
something, Lacan?"

Lacan
"Cut it out...!
It's not...
like that..."

Lacan
"Wh, what?"

You've gotta lighten
up a little...

"Sophia first showed me
that books are the best
way to calm the heart...
...and now I'm hooked on
reading."

Krelian
"I'm not trying to brag...
but I've learned a lot of
things I never knew before.
Lately, I've been reading
this."

Lacan
"What is it?"

Krelian
"Something I borrowed 
from Melchior.
It's about a form of
molecular engineering...
nanotechnology.
I believe it's a book found
in the ancient ruins of the
Zeboim civilization.
It's a copy of someone's
research report, but it's
incomplete.
I think there were even
more wonderful things
written in it, but we'll
never know now..."

Elly
"What's wrong?
You don't look so good."

Elly
"Lately, you've seemed
melancholy almost everyday.
Has something happened?"

Lacan
"I don't know.
I just can't paint
right now.
Sorry, but do you
mind if we stop
here for today..."

Elly
"I see...
It is not good to push
yourself too hard...
Why don't you rest up
for a little while?
I'll have Krelian take
you..."

Krelian
"Even so, there was a
time  when I did some
pretty vicious things.
I lashed out at random...
Everyone around me
feared me...
Even my friends.
I lived a life surrounded
by people who looked at me
with fear in their eyes."

Krelian
"But she was the only one
who wasn't afraid of me.
She would just smile.
Peace of mind...
She was the one who taught
me what that was and how I
could receive it...
She taught me how to live
as a human..."

Krelian
"What are you
doing Lacan?"

Lacan
"Oh it's you, Krelian...
I was thinking...I'd stop
painting the portrait..."

Krelian
"Why stop now...?"

Lacan
"It's the circumstances.
I shouldn't be painting
her at a time like this."

Lacan
"Eventually she too must
stand at the front lines.
So..."

Krelian
"Is that really
the problem?"

Lacan
"..."

Krelian
"Lacan...?"

Lacan
"...
Her smile...
it's killing me.
The more she smiles at me,
the more I...I feel my
very being become
insignificant.
Inside my heart there is
this empty existence.
Other than painting,
I have no worth...
Yet, she continues to
accept my presence.
I feel like I'm getting
smaller and smaller."

Lacan
"I didn't have this
feeling in the beginning.
I just wanted to paint her
one more minute...
one more second longer...
I wanted to keep on
painting forever.
But, suddenly I couldn't.
As the picture neared
completion, the empty part
of me started to manifest
itself in my brush strokes.
I was meant to be painting
her as she really is...
but...this picture is...
my own self...
My empty self has begun to
appear within there.
That's why...
I've got to stop now."

Krelian
"Your own self...?"

Krelian
"You're just running away!
You can't bear it when
she smiles at you.
By painting her portrait,
you noticed the gap between
your own inner emptiness
and her inner abundance.
And you could not fill that
gap...
That's why you are quitting
your painting.
You are refusing her!
Even so, you still can't
bring yourself to leave
her, can you?
In spite of that...
why is it that she
continues to smile at you?
You who can't accept her
feelings...
You who won't accept her
feelings..."

Krelian
"Tell me why!?
If it was me...
who was receiving...
such feelings..."

Roni
"...Is this really
her true expression?"

Lacan
"Yeah...
To people who don't know
her that well...I guess..."

Roni
"Her smile...
I don't know...
The smile in this picture
is somehow different from
the one she usually shows
us.
I realize Lacan's feelings
are in there, but...
I don't think she has ever
opened herself up and shown
her inner self to others
like this before."

Roni
"You've been painting such
a beautiful expression of
Sophia...
I just can't see the reason
why you want to stop."

Lacan
"Beautiful...?
Forget it.
This picture...!?
It's anything but
beautiful..."

Roni
"Lacan, you say you're
empty. Then why do you
come along with us?
What we've been doing
up till now, are not
just acts of mercy...
It's a fight for freedom.
Time and again you've
been through life
threatening situations
with us..."

Roni
"A man who has nothing in
his heart couldn't do that
kind of thing...right?"

Lacan
"Roni, you're giving me
too much credit.
As long as you do some-
thing to keep yourself
occupied...you can ignore
the hollowness inside."

Lacan
"From the beginning, my
very existence itself
was an emptiness.
It wouldn't matter if I
were to die right now...
You live, you die...
That's all..."

Roni
"Pessimistic as usual,
Lacan...
And now you're lying."

Lacan
"..."

Roni
"It is just that you're not
good at expressing your own
feelings.
You're not empty.
She knows that.
That's why she shows only
you her true smile."

Lacan
"I don't deserve to
see her true smile.
She is the hope of the
people. Their support.
There is so much more
for her to do."

Lacan
"Why would she open her
heart to a mere artist
like me..."

Rene
"Bro! Bro~!"

Rene
"Hey, bro...
What are you
doing here?"

Roni
"What's up?"

Zephyr
"The Council of Elders of
Shevat issued a decision.
Tomorrow we will leave
for Soylent."

Roni
"Soylent?
That's in Solaris..."

Rene
"Yes.
And...Sophia will
be coming with us."

Krelian
"That's ridiculous!"

Krelian
"The refugees are still
increasing! We can't afford
to have Sophia leave Nisan!
And going to Soylent!
That's plain foolish!
It's too dangerous!
What are the elders
thinking?"

Zephyr
"No.
It wasn't the
council's wish."

Zephyr
"It was Sophia's will. It
appears that she expressed
this desire herself."

Krelian
"That can't be...
What is she thinking?"

"Originally, we 
talked about it
being just us..."

Krelian
"Okay...
I suppose you are right."

Lacan
"Elly...
I am so sorry."

Lacan
"I...
It was my misjudgement
that did this to you."

Lacan
"I was terrified...
It was like you could see
right through me...
Your eyes... 
That look...
That was me that was
being reflected back
in your eyes...
I was looking at myself...
And thus painting myself...
I couldn't stand it!
So that's why...
Oh Elly...
What in the heavens did
you find inside of me?"

Lacan
"When you wake up, I think
I will ask you that...
On second thought, no...
No, I don't want to burden
you with my concerns...
Besides I wouldn't be able
to ask you...
One look into your eyes
and I can't say a thing...
I wouldn't even be able to
tell you how I feel..."

Sophia
"You are the sweetest
person..."

Lacan
"Elly...!"

Elly
"You are someone who cannot
bear to see others hurt by
your own actions.
So you hold everything in
and bear all the burden.
If you get hurt in the end,
you think that is fine..."

Elly
"That's...
what I like
about you."

Lacan
"Stop! Don't say that.
If you become just another
human, everyone will..."

Elly
"Humans...aren't all that
frail you know.
They don't need a symbol
who is just appearances
only.
I believe that if you have
light in your heart, you
can overcome any hardship.
What I have been doing is
simply showing people that
such light exists in the
hearts of everyone."

Elly
"I'm just a woman.
And to fulfill my womanhood
I am prepared to throw away
anything...
even this position.
I'm just playing the role
of Sophia.
But I am still me.
I haven't changed...
a cowardly, selfish,
crybaby...
I am still the same."

Elly
"Could you live a lie like
that and still be happy...?
I...don't want to do that."

Elly
"Oh, Lacan...
I want to live more
honestly with myself...
To be able to tell the
man that I love that I do
love him. And I don't care
if I get hurt or rejected.
You only have one life.
I don't want to turn around
later and regret not having
done such things..."

   I..."

Wait for me!

This is as far
as you can come.

From here on is my world.
You can't enter.

What do you mean?

You're a subordinate,
fake persona...
that's why.

A subordinate
fake persona?

Yes...
He has part of my
memories from back then...
He has sealed away
the very meaning of
my existence...
my drive...
my motivation...
my subconscious -Id-.
Because of that,
I became a basic,
blank persona.
And on top of that, I
constructed a new persona
based on my experiences
since then...
That is what you are now!

Him? 
You mean father?

You call him father?
He who never did
anything for you?

It was because of his
cowardly behavior...
If only he had been
able to protect me...

If he had done that...
mother wouldn't have died...

Didn't my mother die
right after I was born?
What really happened to
my mother? Tell me Id!

You don't need to know.
You'll only disappear soon.
Along with your basic
persona, the 'coward'.
I'll rule my being through
the power of the Existence.

??

Of course you don't know.
But it is etched in my
metempsychotic memory.
Your persona is fake, so
you'll never stand on the
'stage' of consciousness.
You'll never be able to
take charge of the memories
from our past lives.

I know the dreams and
hallucinations! I've
seen them many times!

Them...
I showed them to
you on purpose.
To break the seal,
I chose to weaken
the power of your
existence.
If your mental
energy is weakened,
I can become free
to do as I wish.

What?

There are still things
inside you which you
haven't been shown yet...

Huh?

Someone's coming!
It's probably your friends.
They must have followed me.

Where are you going?

I came to reestablish
contact with the
Existence.
To tie together all the
threads of your memories
since ancient times...
and then cut them off...
That is the fate of the
Contact... All is ready.
It's time for the true
awakening!
I will eliminate all
those who were full of
hypocrisy from the very
beginning.

Wait!
Wait for me, Id!

You just stay
here and observe!

Fei's Story - 1930
————————————————————————————

Our's was an ordinary family.

A strict but reliable father.

A kind and loving mother.

Up till then, it was
complete happiness.

But one day...

Mother suddenly changed.

She was like a
totally different
person.
From that day on...
'Fei' lost his home.

Father was away often.
He had some important work.

————————————————————————————
The Experiments - 1932
————————————————————————————

When father was away from
home, 'Fei' was taken to
a place with mysterious
machines.

Inside there were many 
strangely dressed people.

Many types of probes were
injected into 'Fei's' body,
as the start to some kind
of experiments.
The tests caused Fei much
pain.

Mom, help me!

What are you doing!?

No!

Nooo!

————————————————————————————
The Experiments - 1932
————————————————————————————

Mother didn't come
to his assistance.
Young 'Fei' had no
way of resisting.
But he was able to endure.

Eventually,
the experiments 
became unbearable.

Many people gathered
around 'Fei'.
These people had a high
compatibility with the
Anima Relics.
This psychic contact
with Fei was to force
him to awaken.

But no one could make
contact with 'Fei'.
The power drawn out of
'Fei', regardless of his
will, destroyed them all.

This is unbelieveable!
Mother allowed this to
take place...?
Psychic contact?
What do you mean by
'awaken' me?

To awaken god, everything
had to be in perfect order,
with nothing lacking...
Things divided in the past
must become one complete
whole again...

Countless people died
before Fei's eyes.

Men, women,
the old, the young,
even demi-humans...
Suffering, grief,
fear, ecstasy...
A variety of emotions
and words lingered...
And tumbled about Fei 
like broken dolls...

It was a scene...
    from hell!

————————————————————————————
Fei's Story - 1930
————————————————————————————

In front of father
she acted normally.

When Fei tried to tell father
about mother's strange conduct
and the experiments, father's
mind was taken up by his work
and he didn't really listen.

He thought it was just
childhood fantasies.

But he didn't have
to endure the pain
much longer...

'Fei's' subconscious
discovered a way to
escape from the trauma.

He formed a separate
persona to deal with
things he didn't like
or couldn't bear.

He removed himself from
out of harms way.
My role was to have all the
things he hated forced upon
me, the moment they arose.

From the time of my
division from him, I
was dominated by hatred.
That hatred naturally
turned into destructive
impulses.

I wanted to destroy
everything.

Mother, father, 
the entire world...

Finally father noticed
mother's odd behavior, but
it was already too late.
I had completely separated
from that coward...
my original self.

The puppets were broken
...and...
'Fei's' heart was too...

What would make mother
do such a thing...?

Mother repeated the
experiments to study
the power she knew
existed within me.
Yes, that woman...
mother, was Miang.

That's a lie!

No, it's true.

Mother was Miang.

mother's turn.
Only Elly was 'special'
originally!!"

Grahf came seeking
the power that
exists within me.
To return to his
own body.
You understand now,
don't you...?
Grahf is...Lacan.

We, his descendants who
inherited his lingering
thoughts and memories
from him, know only too
well...
Divided 500 years ago...
He would became a part
of us both...
Lacan became Grahf.
He destroyed everything
on the face of the earth.
He then mastered how
to possess the bodies
of others by dwelling
in their minds.
He was probably enabled
to do this after his
contact with the
'Existence'.
The bodies died but
Lacan's spirit
continued living by
possessing others.
He had come that day
to return his soul, at
last, to the perfect
reincarnation of his
physical body...
The body of 'Fei'.

Father...
fought him.
But he couldn't
protect mother or I.
He pitifully fought
on while coughing
up his life blood.

Grahf made a mockery of
father and mother would
not even help him when
he needed her the most.
As for their son...
'He' couldn't take what
was happening any more...

————————————————————————————
► Anime Cutscene - Karen's Death pt. 1

He gave into his feelings
and released his power.
And as a result...

...Mother died.

Mom!

And 'he', off-loaded
the results of his
actions onto me.
To avoid taking the
responsibility for
killing mother, he
used me as a shield.

"I also killed mother."

————————————————————————————
Fei's Subconscious - 1936

He pushed all the bad
things onto me...
but kept all the memories
filled with happiness and
mother's love to himself.
And he shut himself away
with those memories
inside his own little
shell...forever.
This is the place.
What you see before you,
is what he made.
He just keeps hanging on
to those memories.

That's what this is...

Stop it!
Just stop it!
This...
These scenes...
Are these all
there is to us?

Enough already!
There is nothing here!
Just a world filled with
deception and pain...

It can't be helped.

This is 'everything'...

it to the person who

You should talk.
You're the one who
killed mother!

No I didn't, you did!
I did not kill her!
Mother didn't care

Father didn't notice
either...
That's why you
killed her!
I didn't kill her!
I didn't!
I didn't...!

Knock it off!!

...'We' killed mother.
It's no one's fault
but ours.
It's not because she
became Miang or because
father didn't notice.
Don't look outside for
the reason. Don't blame
anyone but yourself.
Yes, mother was Miang,
and I know that you
suffered. No one could
have endured it.
But you can't push it
onto Id alone.
We are all one person.
We must all become one.
Right? Fei...

Walk on your own two feet!
Face up to the reality that
you don't want to see!

Show them to Id.

for yourself...

all grim, Id...

My power...
couldn't save anyone.
It only destroyed.
I thought that I could
only make a connection
with others through
destruction.
So I had to destroy
it all. People...
The world...
Even Elly...

No...
That's not the case.
We can save others
just as our mother,
despite being Miang,
saved us.
Our power...
can save people...
We can save Elly!

Then figure out what
ought to be done.

not yet complete.
