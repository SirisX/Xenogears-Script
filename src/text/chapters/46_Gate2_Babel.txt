Bart
"Thanks to you, Aveh has
been taken back from
Shakhan and Gebler.
Thank you.
Now, in order to free
other lands from
Gebler and Solaris...
...we must destroy the
other two gates and
bring down Solaris.
We've learned from
Shakhan's notes that the
gates form the points 
of a triangle."

One point was the Great
Mausoleum. 
Two others remain, but we
only know where one is.

Citan
"Yes, under the 'Ethos'
headquarters. However..."

Billy
"It wasn't there when we
followed Stone under
the 'Ethos' headquarters.
If it really is there...
it must be buried deep
beneath the earth..."

Rico
"How are we gonna 
destroy it then?"

Chu-Chu
"By combining
everyone's
Gear power."

Rico
"What are we gonna do 
with everyone's Gear,
dig a giant hole in
the ground?"

Chu-Chu
"What's wrong
with that?"

Sigurd
"...it would take years."

Fei
"What if we used 
Shevat's cannon..."

Maria
"If that worked, we would
have tried it already."

Fei
"...Oh..."

Citan
"So it must be something
more powerful than
Shevat's cannon."

Elly
"And we don't have a
Gebler battleship."

Fei
"Is there any weapon
that powerful on earth?"

Citan
"Gebler battleships and
Shevat's cannon are the
most powerful weapons
ever produced by man..."

Bart
"...but...
I seem to remember
seeing something..."

Sigurd
"What?"

Bart
"A weapon with firepower
like those two...
Yeah! I got it!
Ft. Jasper!
Her gun can take out
a mountain!
What about that?"

Bart
"Citan, what?"

Citan
"However powerful the Jasper
may be, how are we going to
aim it at the 'Ethos' H.Q.?
To damage something that
deep underground we would
have to attack it from
directly above.
But the Jasper gun is..."

Sigurd
"Yes, of course..."

Rico
"What, are you sayin' we
should just move Ft.
Jasper on top of Babel?"

Billy
"Now that you mention it,
Babel does overlook their
headquarters.
If we shoot it from there
it might just possibly be
able to reach that far
underground."

Sigurd
"But how could we move
Ft. Jasper?"

Elly
"It's impossible.
Something that heavy..."

Fei
!

Fei
"Didn't the control room
in Babel control a
cannon or something?
I think it moved the
giant mirror outside."

Bart
"Maria, do you know
of anything like that?"

Maria
"I've never heard
anything about it but..."

Fei
"But it might be there.
Let's go check."

Bart
"Alright..."

Citan
!

Citan
"Wait a moment...
A giant mirror and a giant
cannon both from the same
ruins? There might just be
something in this..."

Bart
"Like what?"

Citan
"Ah...
I have solved
the puzzle..."

Sigurd
"Puzzle, what puzzle?"

Citan
"The Babel and Jasper
ruins are from the same
civilzation. (-ERROR-??? spelling civilization)
One far more advanced
than our own...
Do not the two structures
seem similar to you?
I believe they were both
built with Gears and a
powerful foe in mind."

Fei
"Yeah, I noticed that. 
But what's it all mean?"

Citan
"It means, the people
who built the giant
mirror at Babel Tower...
...knew about the giant
gun at Jasper!"

Bart
"And...?
What are you
getting at?"

Citan
"We can probably assume
the mirror was built to
reflect something...
That something being a
beam. A beam shot from
the Jasper gun!"

Fei
"Reflect?
You mean that mirror can
reflect a beam attack?"

Citan
"Yes."

Rico
"Long ago Babel and
Jasper must have
been at war."

Citan
"Not exactly.
The Babel mirror and
Jasper gun were combined
to make one weapon."

Rico
"Whaddya mean?"

Elly
"But those things are so
far apart, how could they
be one weapon?"

Citan
"Well the gates may be
far apart, but aren't
they still one device?"

Elly
"Yes, I see what
you mean but..."

Billy
"What did they use
that weapon for?"

Citan
"That, I do not know."

Bart
"Whatever. The point is
how do we use the
two weapons as one?"

Citan
"Aim the Jasper gun at
the mirror and fire.
The mirror will reflect
the beam on the gate."

Bart
!

Maria
"Do you think it will
work?"

Citan
"Theoretically.
It will require a few
minor adjustments..."

Sigurd
"Adjusting the mirror
is going to be rather
difficult and tedious."

Citan
"If the two weapons are
one, then it should not
be too difficult.
I hope..."

Rico
"It sounds dangerous.
I think it was meant to
reflect shots back at
the enemy.
If you're wrong it'll
come back and hit you."

Citan
"Yes. That is why it is
most difficult for the
gun crew.
The mirror must be hit
precisely."

Citan
"We will need to divide
into two teams.
One will fire the gun...
While the other will adjust
the angle of the mirror to
ensure the beam hits the
'Ethos' headquarters.
Since this was my idea,
I will take the dangerous
part of adjusting the
mirror."

Sigurd
"Alright Hyuga, we'll
let you take care of
that...
...It seems like
your type of job."

Fei
"I'll go too.
Doc might need help."

Elly
"It might be lonely with
just Citan and Fei.
So I had better go too."

Sigurd
"Alright, you three take
Babel. Now what about
the gun?"

Billy
"I'll do it. Looks like
my kind of job.
Don't worry, I won't
miss. I haven't been
using a gun for nothing."

Bart
"Well, I probably better
go to the Jasper."

Chu-Chu
"Me chu! Chu-Chu 
wants to go chu!"

Bart
"Then it's settled.
You go with Citan to aim
the mirror at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
We'll aim the Jasper gun
at the mirror.
Let's get back to the
Yggdrasil and get going!"
ggdrasil and get going!"

there are three on earth,
and one in Solaris..."

Sigurd
"According to
Shakhan's report,
each gate is
placed in a triangle
around Solaris..."

Citan
"Let us look at the map
given by the Queen,
which describes the area
before the gates were
placed."

————————————————————————————
World Map - 1220

Citan
This is how the land
actually looks like
on the other side of
the invisible barrier.
The Gates should be
set up somewhere here
on this map.

First, the Ignas' Gate is... here.

The 'Ethos' H.Q. in
Aquvy is here, so...

Fei
"Well, logically thinking
the next place could be
here, or..."

Fei
"Here.
One of the two."

Elly
"North or south, huh...
Well, at least we have even
chances of guessing which."

————————————————————————————
Yggdrasil III Gun Room - 1212
————————————————————————————

Bart
"What if we try both ways?
Isn't that all it takes?"

Sigurd
"That would be difficult.
I doubt they expected the
2nd gate to be destroyed.
So I'm sure they'll be
serious next time.
We'd better plan it
carefully but quickly."

Citan
"In any case, we will not
be able to avoid Gebler's
interference, will we?"

Fei
"Doc, Elly, where
exactly is Solaris
located?"

Elly
"There is only a map of
Solaris in Solaris.
I didn't even know the
area of this land until
I arrived here."

Fei
"Even in Gebler?"

Elly
"The relations with
earth are only revealed 
to commanders."

Bart
"If that's the case,
even Billy's father may
not know it."

Sigurd
"Jesiah left there in the
middle of it."

Citan
"Sigurd and I were
smugglers
and did not have the time
to look out the window.
On top of that,
when going through the
gate from Solaris,
we transferred to other
places by using the
environmental plane
between each gate.
Remember when we made
contact with the Kislev
gate in the Goliath?
The same thing happens
and we lose all sense of
where we were before."

Fei
"Even if the gate divides
the other space, can't you
recognize its topography?
Like mountains, jungles
and so on?"

Elly
"...I don't think there
were mountains.
More like we were
surrounded by the ocean..."

Bart
"Ocean...
Then it can't be the
north?
This is the pole. It's
all covered with snow."

Fei
"Then it's settled.
The location of the gate
is south of here.
The center of the triangle
is only the ocean.
If the gates are placed
in the highest point in the
north, the center will be
the continent.
Hence, it coincides with
Elly's story."

Citan
"You may be right."

Sigurd
"Wait a minute. There
shouldn't be any facility
over the ocean."

Elly
"Then, underwater?"

Sigurd
"Hmm...
But the whole area around
here is deep.
If it exists,
it must be deep down."

Fei
"The Yggdrasil is a
submarine, right? Then,
what's the problem?"

Bart
"You're crazy!
It is a submarine but
not a bathyscaphe.
It isn't made for deep
sea exploration. The water
pressure would crush us
instantaneously."

Fei
"We have a problem..."

Citan
"We may be able to use the
bathyscaphes or Gears used
by the Salvagers..."

Bart
"'Salvager'?
Right!
That's it!"

Fei
??

Bart
"The captain of the Thames
must have tons of them.
He owes us from last time.
Let's go to the Thames."

"It may be our best
choice for now. Shall
we go to the Thames?"

Ramsus, he couldn't

Blue 2
What is the purpose of
his existence...

Red 4
Once 'trash', always
'trash'. How much can one
really expect?

Blue 1
However, it must not
be aligned before the
'Animus' data is

Red 3
You are right.
There is a higher

not getting
the proper type.

As it was in the
past...

We can't allow the 
lambs to go free yet.

"Who cares about the

Krelian...

Blue 1
This can't be.
The panic has spread

"Those fools we call

His body's already at

"As usual a 
clone may be used.
Those fools won't know
the difference.
And even if the 
barrier fails, it
still will not be like 
the disaster before.
Anyhow...
if I recall, there's some
very intriguing data on
that memory cube."

Blue 4
And what is that?

Krelian
"The 'mother'."

Red 1
The 'mother'?

Krelian
"Indeed.
It is probable that the
'mother' exists
among the Lambs."

Blue 3
Are you telling us
our 'mother'is
somewhere else? 
Why didn't we
notice that
sooner...?

Krelian
"The sign of the
'mother'...
Her persona, only
appears after she
reaches a certain
age...
There is also a high
probability that she
transmigrated into
the 'Antitype'."

Blue 2
The 'Antitype'...
That woman from Nisan...?

Krelian
"Here...
I would like to use that
nanotechnology product,
'Emeralda'."

Red 4
What you retrieved
from the Thames?
Why?

Krelian
"To be sure.
As 'mother' says,
that nanomachine colony...
that artificial organism,
was a creation between the
'Contact' and the
'Antitype' 4000 years ago."

Blue 1
The 'mother's'
memory...

Krelian
"Yes, that is it.
We can probably attain
some kind of reaction.
But even if we obtain no
reaction, and if
'Emeralda'is destroyed,
I've already gathered all
the data I need.
Any loss of it will have no
consequence to the plan."
