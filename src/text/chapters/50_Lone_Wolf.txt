Krelian
"Children of the Emperor, 
please open your heart."

Elly
"Krelian!"

Fei
"Huh?"

Elly
"That's Krelian. 
He's the real leader
of Solaris.
He doesn't appear
in public very
often.
That's all I know."

Fei
"He's...
the leader
of Solaris?
What...
Why do I feel...
Something seems
familiar."

Krelian
"It's been a long 
time Lacan."

Lacan
"Krelian. 
You're back?"

Krelian
"I just got back 
last night.
You came back home 
to get paints, right?
Sophia told me.
Allow me to accompany
you."

Lacan
"Is that okay?"

Krelian
"Yeah.
I'll leave someone else
in command of my unit.
Because of Solaris,
things are a lot more
dangerous these days.
Anyway, wouldn't you feel
more secure if you were
with me?"

Lacan
"...Thanks."

Lacan
"...What did you say?
What's the name of the 
teacher you're studying 
under?"

Krelian
"Melchior"

Lacan
"But still,
why are you studying?"

Krelian
"Sophia told me the best 
way to calm the heart is
to read a book...
It's a good opportunity.
And it has sparked my
interest in studying."

Krelian
"...Now,
I'm reading 3 books 
a day."

Lacan
"If it can change,
it will."

Lacan
"...The art of war,
that's all you think 
about......"

Krelian
"Hey, that's mean.
You know, I'm the best of
all of his students."

Lacan
"I see......
That's great,
it sounds like you found 
something to put your 
heart into......"

Krelian
"What do you mean?"

Krelian
"You have something.
Your pictures are 
splendid.
You should be 
thankful......"

Krelian
"...The gate we control
was removed by will of
the Emperor. 
However, there are 
foolish beasts here 
defiling our holy land 
with their feet.
These beasts destroyed
the gate and want to remove
the Emperor from the throne
in the confusion.
This is a grave matter,
the Emperor's throne
has been polluted.
We cannot rest yet.
Those imbeciles have
been caught and shackled
like the dogs they are!"

Ughh!

Elly
(Don't yell!
What if they find out
you're a land dweller?)

Fei
(Sorry,
couldn't help it.
They've been caught!
Damn...
Let's go!
We gotta help them......)

Elly
(Wait!
He's still talking...)

Elly
('To revive
our progenitors,
the Gazel of old...
The day after tomorrow, 
these land dwellers
will be disposed of in
the Soylent System'.)

Fei
(Revive Gazel?
Soylent System?
What's that?)

Elly
('Gazel' are purebreed
Solaris people... the word
means 1st Class citizens.
...But, in this case,
it probably means 
'the Gazel Ministry'.
Long ago the members of the
Gazel Ministry lost their
fleshly bodies in order to
protect the Solaris people.
I've heard the Soylent
System is an important
support system for Solaris,
but I don't know much else.
Anyway, it's probably a
cover for some kind of
experiment...)

Fei
"Don't tell me what to do!
I'm going! 
Those guys won't stop me."

Elly
"That's why I said wait!
We don't know what's
going on over there.
If we just run out there
brazenly, we might just
fall into the same trap!
The palace is on alert so
we need to investigate... 
We don't even know where
they were taken prisoners.
We still have 2 days,
I'm sure there's a way
to help them. 
We must find it."

Fei
"How do you know we
have two whole days?
What if they change 
their mind and then
tomorrow...
I mean, it is possible
isn't it?"

Elly
"Maybe...But there's
nothing we can do, right?
Citan wasn't there, which
means he's probably
watching the broadcast
somewhere right now.
First we must find him.
He knows the layout of
the central core of the
city better than I do.
So let's not do anything
careless, okay?"

Fei
"Where is he?
We need him!"

Elly
"How should I know?"

Fei
"Don't be a snot.
You haven't thought
anything out at all!"

were missing in action..."

Elly
"No, mother,
that's not true.
See, I'm alive!"

Elly
"Mother,
where is father?"

Medena
"He's still at the 
palace. I think he'll 
be back soon..."

Elly
"I see..."

Medena
"Elly, who's this?"

Elly
"What? Ah...
Um, he's from the
Special Forces,
the same as me.
He was only recently
promoted from 3rd Class
citizen.
It's because of him
I was able to return."

Right, Fei?

Fei
"What? Um...no...I mean..."

Medena
"I see. That must be why
he's dressed like a land
dweller.
But, why isn't
he wearing a Special
Forces uniform
like you, Elly?"

Elly
"S, sorry mother. There's 
a report I must turn in 
right away, so..."

Elly
"Fei, come with me."

Elly
"This is my room..."

Elly
"Ahh, I can finally relax."

Fei
"This place is huge!
It must be bigger than 
the village chief's!"

Elly
"Heh.
I'm sweaty after running,
so I'm taking a shower."

Fei
"You have a bathroom
in your room?"

Elly
"It's pretty normal."

Fei (*???add*)
...
(It's not normal...)

Elly
"When are you going to 
stop staring?"

Fei
"Hey, 
Elly, 
was that your mother?"

Elly
"Yes."

Fei
"Oh.
She sure is a pretty lady."

Elly
"...
Yes, she is."

Fei
"But you don't look 
much like her.
Do you resemble your 
father?"

Elly
"Haven't you noticed yet?"

Fei
"What do you mean?"

Elly
"The color of my skin,
hair, and eyes are...
different from normal
Solarians..."

Fei
"I've never paid 
attention to it so...
Really?"

Elly
"A long time ago, when I
was small, I had a nanny.
She was so nice to me.
But she was a land dweller.
And First Class citizens
rarely associate with them.
But the nanny lived in 
our house and took care 
of me.
She lost her child when 
she was in the 3rd Class 
area...
My dad felt sorry for her 
and kept her under his 
protection. But he never 
told anyone about her..."

Fei
"Why?"

Elly
"My father was worried 
about my appearance...
He had a reason for it.
She was probably my
real..."

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"I'd better not...
I'm sure you don't want 
to hear about this...
Sorry."

Fei
"That's alright..."

————————————————————————————

Elly
"Now, it's your turn!"

Fei
"No thanks.
I don't have time for
that."

Elly
"You need to relax.
You don't get a chance 
like this very often.
Please?"

Fei
"Alright, if you insist!"

Elly
"You should've listened 
to me in the first place."

Fei (*???add*)
...!!

Wa---a-a-a!!

Elly
"You're fine.
Just relax."

"Wow...feels good.
There's a world of
difference between this
and doc's old bath tub!"

Fei (*???add*)

Fei
"S, stop it!
Stop staring at me!"

Elly
"Don't worry, I'm not
looking.
I'm just adjusting it.
How's the temperature?"

Fei
"Hey,
I'm fine.
Go away, NOW!!"

choice..."

Fei
"You have any good 
ideas?"

Elly
"The network terminal
in my father's room.
He got angry with me
for touching it once.
There is numerous
information only a handful

It's me, Erich.
A burglar broke in here,
yeah, come quickly."

Fei is not a burglar!!"

"Then, what is he?
A strange man in my room...
Isn't he a burglar?"

Elly
"There's a reason...
!!"

Elly
"Please! Don't shoot him!
Fei just wants to save
his captured friends!
They're my friends too!"

Erich
"No! Even if he is your 
friend,
I can't overlook
a land dweller who tries
to sneak into the palace!"

Elly
"Fine. 
Then I'm also a traitor.
Go ahead and shoot me!"

Erich
"No!
You're staying here!
Now, move out of the way
Elly!!"

Elly
"No!"

Erich (*???add*)
......

Erich
"You know how traitors're 
punished even if they're 
1st Class citizens!
You'll be safe if we kill 
the intruders who know 
about us. I'm worried 
about your safety..."

Elly
"You're lying!
You just hate being in any
postion that endangers you.
Isn't that why you didn't 
want me to join Jugend?
You just didn't want 
everyone to see your 
own daughter!"

"Because I'm half a
land dweller...!"

Medena (*???add*)

"I can't believe you 
still...?
How dare you say that in

Fei
"Stop it!!
I don't want to see a
father and a daughter
fight because of me.
I won't cause you anymore
trouble.
I came of my own will.
I'm an intruder.
If I just get out of here
it'll be fine."

Elly
"Fei!?"

Fei
"Elly, 
you shouldn't say that
in front of your mother.
I don't know the truth, 
but she is your mother,
not a stranger.
Isn't that right?"

Elly (*???add*)

"Now, get out of the way.
I hafta hurry to save my 
friends. But if you intend
to shoot me, I'll put up a
big fight."

"Doc!! Citan,
why are you here!?"

Citan
"I saw Bart's image on
the Birdvision in the
dedication."

Fei
"You saw that too, doc?"

Citan
"Yes. But I did not
see either of you.
Soon after, I heard
there was an intruder
at the 2nd floor of
the Arebato Grounds.
I suspected
it was probably you
so I waited here.
After that,
I did not hear anything
about the capture of
any intruders."

Fei
"How did you know I was
going to be here?"

Citan
"The best possible way to
sneak into the Palace
is through the dust chute.
And to get back to
the 3rd floor, one must
pass through this
observation tower.
I have always
been thinking...
Do you think you could
possibly be a little more
subtle?
When infiltrating
enemy ground, the most
basic thing to do is to
be stealthy.
With the amount of
activity you have stirred
up, you could even wake
up the dead."

Fei
"Well, I was actually
trying to be subtle..."

Citan
"By the way, what
happened to Elly?
Was she not with you?"

Fei
"Elly... She went back
home.
She really shouldn't have
any relation with us land
dwellers.
She already has such
wonderful parents..."

Citan
"I see...
Yes. It may have been
better for her that
way. Let us head for
the dust chute then."

Fei (*???add*)
Yeah!

Citan
"Now Fei, stay very close
to me.
That way it does not pick
up on your presence."

??

Fei
"Doc, hold on. 
How can you get 
past here?
According to Elly, only
1st Class citizens
and military personnel
can pass through...?"

Citan
"Uh!? Well...that is...
P, probably they have not
deleted my ID from the days
I was in the military 
and it is still stored
in the data bank."

My, how the Solaris

"The Imperial Guard?
Why are you here instead
of the military police...?"

Elly (*???add*)
What?

Erich
"What are you doing?
The intruder fled.
My daughter has nothing
to do with this!"

Imperial Guard (*???add*)
I can't, Lord Erich.
Turn your daughter 
over to us.
Lord Krelian's orders.

Erich
"Lord Krelian? What does
he want with my daughter...
What?
You mean...Gazel's...!"

Imperial Guard (*???add*)
You do not need to know.

Take her!

Erich
"Leave my daughter alone!
Or else!"

Elly
"Father!?"

Imperial Guard (*???add*)
W, what!?
Lord Erich! Have you lost 
your mind?

Erich
"I'm perfectly fine!
Leave her alone!"

Imperial Guard (*???add*)
Lord Krelian's orders are
the Emperor's orders.
You realize what'll
happen to your rank
if you disobey this order?
You'll be demoted to
3rd Class citizen!

Erich
"I know.
But even if it's Lord
Krelian's order I will
not allow my daughter to
be Gazel's test subject.
Elly, go!
I'll take care of this!"

Elly
"But..."

Erich
"Don't worry about me.
Go help Fei."

Elly
"Father..."

Elly
"Father,
mother..."

Fei
"Elly..."

Citan
"...The 'Ministry'...
..."

Elly
"'Ministry'!?
Father said that too!!
What is the 'Ministry'?"

Citan
"...You will
find out."

Fei
"Let's go back!
We gotta save him!"

Elly
"We can't!
If you go now, they'll
catch you too.
My parents will be fine.
Their military record
should protect them.
...If necessary I'll turn
myself in after everyone
is rescued and that will
settle it."

Fei
"But..."

Elly
"Let's go.
Something might happen
to them while we're
just talking here."

Citan
"I am worried for Elly's
family, but...
Her father risked his
life to get us this card.
We must go on!"

Fei (*???add*)
Yeah!

Citan
"But in this filthy place?
Spare me.
What I would not give
for my old bath-tub now!
Do you not agree, Fei?"

?

Fei
"OK, let's go!"
