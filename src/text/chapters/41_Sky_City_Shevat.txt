"This is the dock floor
located at the lowest
layer of Shevat."

Girl
"I met you a little
while ago. My name is
Maria Balthasar."

Fei
"Balthasar...?
I've heard of that name
before."

Fei
"That's right!
Ol' man Bal,
the hermit."

Fei
"That reminds me, the Gear
I saw resembles Bal's Gear,
Calamity."

Maria
"Calamity!?
That's the prototype Gear
my grandfather made."

Maria
"Do you know my grandpa?
Where is he now!?"

Fei
"I just happened to come
across him in the cavern
underneath Aveh's desert.
I didn't know him that
well...
So you're Ol' man Bal's
grandchild."

Maria
"Yes...but I haven't seen
him for the past few
years..."

Maria
"He said he was looking
for something very
important.
And he left by himself
...
My father was captured
by Solaris and his
whereabouts are not
known either..."

-ALT- Bart in Party

Bart
"Hey, Fei. Isn't that the
same name as the
eccentric old man?
Remember the crazy old
man playing with Gears
underground Aveh?"

Bart
"But, the crazy o....
your grandpa looked just
fine.
He's the kind that never
dies. Don't worry,
squirt."

Maria
"I'm not a 'squirt'!!
Besides, my grandpa 
isn't a crazy old man,
I know it!!"

Bart
"Sorry.
Don't get mad, squi...
Maria.
I didn't meant to offend.
I apologize.
Sorry, sorry."

Maria
"I heard you say sorry
once already. You don't
need to say it again."

————————————————————————————

Maria
"I'm glad Grandpa Bal's
doing fine."

Maria
"Please go ahead and
take the elevator to
go upstairs.
I still have to finish
inspecting Seibzehn."

Maria
"I'll show you the way
to the Palace when the
time comes.
Till then, please take
a look around town."

Maria
"I'll see you later."

Fei
"Alright.
Let's go up there."

Fei (-ERROR-??? Actually Elly)
"Shevat...the only
organization that stands
against Solaris..."

Citan
"You are right...
We came this far,
we cannot turn back
now, Fei."

Maria
"This Seibzehn was
developed by my father.
At the research
institute in Solaris..."

Maria
"I just turned five years
old at that time, and had
no clue what was happening.
Using me as a hostage,
they forced my father to
continue the research..."

Maria
"But he never showed his
pain or sorrow in front
of me...
He always smiled 
and said...
'Don't worry, Maria,
 Seibzehn will be
 by your side to
 protect you...' "

Maria
"Five years ago, that day,
when I fell behind in our
escape...
My father protected me
and ended up
being left behind..."

Maria
"My father's voice, his
smiles...are leaving me.
They are far away, 
becoming obscure...
I believed this would
never happen...I swore
I'd never forget...!
Now, the only connection
between my father and me
is this Seibzehn..."

Maria
"But...I'll save my
father someday!
I'll bring back my
father's smile!
Seibzehn and I will
do it, I swear...!!
I swear...!!
..."

Maria
"Sorry...I shouldn't have
told you such a bizarre
story...
It has nothing to do with
you..."

————————————————————————————

Maria
"It'll take a bit 
more time to inspect
Seibzehn.
Please go up there,
and take a look around
town."

Man 1
They say the fight between
you and Seibzehn
was well matched?
Amazing...
There are still people
from the surface that can
do all that.
No sweat. If we all work
together, we can teach
Solaris a thing or two!

...Maybe

Bald Man
But, this is such a
monster...Maria's father
designed something really
extraordinary.
I hear he's a Solaris
scientist, but I still
respect him. He proved to
me a genius really exists.

Man 2
Well, talking about
servicing, it's not like
we know everything about
Seibzehn.
Realistically, all we can do
is check for abnormalities
and do simple repairs.

Don't worry,
I'll also take a look at
your Gears later.

Shevat Entrance - 1454
————————————————————————————

Old Man
Oh, we rarely have
visitors from the surface.
Welcome to the wandering 
city in the sky, Aphel 
Aura.

This city used to be the
capital of Shevat, an
independent liberal country 
that fought against Solaris.
A place that turns
yesterday's tears into
tomorrow's smiles...
That's what they called
this city a long time ago...
But now, those hopes and
despairs have been worn
away long ago...
Probably the only things
that remain are the echoes
of resentment...

You might be able to find
something that can solve
your troubles and sadness.
But fate can be cruel
sometimes...
Don't forget that.

And, that stone plate
floating there is called
a Stepping Stone. It
moves with people on it.
Try and get on it and
talk to the stone.
It'll be glad to give
three of you a ride.

————————————————————————————

Shevat Woman???
Why do humans hate and
hurt each other?
Everyone lives under
the same blue sky...
Will there ever be any
relief from the pain of
losing what was precious
to us?
When will it be the day 
we can understand what
all this loneliness and
sorrow was for?
In short, we may be
repeating the same 
mistake we made
500 years ago...

Camel Man
That large white statue of
an angel at the entrance 
of the palace is a 
representation of a
particular woman who
sacrificed herself in that
war 500 years ago.
It's so sad. She was probably
the beloved heroine of
the rebellion back then.

Bald Man
Yo, this house is basically
an apartment for us land
dwellers that were saved.
I've heard that there
aren't that many pure
Shevites in this town
anymore.
Basically, it's been said
that a majority of them
were lost in that war with
Solaris 500 years ago.

Well, if we're not careful
ourselves, our fates may
be similar too. Heh.

Woman 1
Back in Kislev, I used
to deal with homemade
medicines.
By the way, I've heard 
rumors that the enemy
has some really cool
medicines.
I wanted to learn some of
those techniques, so I
snuck into their shop
but...I was a little
clumsy...heh.

I got desperate and somehow
managed to escape, and make
my way to Thames - the city
I had heard stories about.
That's where the good people
here picked me up.
If they hadn't picked me up
then, without a doubt, I 
would've been a guinea pig 
for their experimental 
drugs...
Because I'm so cute.

Man in green coat
So where did you fellas
come from? From the looks
of it, I'd guess you're
from the Ignas continent.
Were you saved by the people
here too? I understand. We 
were all in the same
situation.
Everyone's got their unique
story on how they got
involved in this fiasco with
the Gebler and the 'Ethos'
and all.
The usual pattern here is
that many of the people were
almost eliminated for some 
reason they don't know but 
were saved by the people here
before they were doomed.

Woman 1
Yeah! Even if I were to
have returned back to the
land, they would probably
try to capture me again.
It wouldn't matter how
many lives I had, it still
wouldn't be enough.
So I've decided to stick
around here.
That's probably the case
for the majority of the
people here.

And anyway, don't you wanna
make the bad guys pay for
it? They gotta be crazy if
they think we'll just take
this lying down!

Man in green coat
That's basically it. 
From now on we're all on
the same boat. 
Welcome aboard!

Man in chair
Yeah, they say this city used
to be like any other city 
when it was on the ground 
500 years ago.
But after losing to Solaris, 
they launched just the 
palace block of the city up 
into the sky.
It's basically an unbelievable
story, but in reality we're 
riding on that part of the 
city, and floating out in the
sky right now.
In life, you never know what
to expect.

Camel Man 2
But...we're in an odd
situation.
We're picking a fight with
an organization that has
the power to manipulate
the world from the shadows.

Heh, and to think we're
all just a motley crew of
rioters from the land
below.
We're just a bunch of 
people who've lived most of
our lives without knowing 
the existence of Shevat or
Solaris...
Come to think of it, 
it almost sounds like a
joke.

Guard 1
Hey, haven't seen you
before. You new?
Welcome to the Shevat
Liberation barracks!!
...But in actuality, we
aren't as glorious as the
name may suggest. Hahaha...
But it is true that this
is the barracks for the
anti-Solaris troops. Think
of this as home and relax.

Man working out
Ha...

What am I doing?
...huff...puff...

Can't you tell!?
...huff...puff...

I'm working out.
...huff...puff...

Gonna kick Solaris' butt.
...huff...puff...

I have to get pumped up.

Guard 2
This is just between you and
me but, I am the one and 
only hope for Shevat.
I am the secret agent man...
In other words, I'm a spy!
Well? Ain't I cool?
...But, come to think of it,
if you're here too, you 
guys are probably no
different than me...sigh...

Woman 2
Have you already met with
Queen Zephyr? A very nice
person she is.
We are all able to live
like this because the
Queen saved us.

Don't scare me...
I was wondering if there're 
some drinks in here.

Are the higher ups still
planning on fighting with
some country called
Solaris?
Aren't they the scary
guys who actually control
the world from the 
shadows?
Uhh...this is crazy.
Just when I thought I was
able to survive.
I can't take it anymore.

Oh, are you new?
It's been so long since
last time we had a visitor
from the surface.
This is a 'Plant Shell'.
Vegetables and fruits
needed in Shevat are grown 
in it.

Since we live away from
the land, we must put
more effort to get food.
Right now, it's a dusty
season so only the staff
members are allowed to 
go in.
Humans are good carriers 
of germs, you know.

I'll bring some fresh
Thunder Strawberries for
you to eat. So look
forward to it.

Come again!
I'll give you a discount
next time!

Old Yellow Chu
They're so beautiful.
These are wonderful things
that nobody else sells,
yes they are.
But this's a very important
treasure of the Chu-chu,
so I can't sell it to you.
Sooorry. Please go to the
counter if you'd like to
buy something. Thank you, 
thank you.

Chu 1
There is a rumor that
the secret room of the
Sage of Shevat is hidden
somewhere in this town.
I wonder if it's true?

Chu 2
Wha? That's strange.
You smell like soil and
trees, yes, you do.
Looooong ago, the Chu-chu
Tribe lived in the woods,
with no interference,
yes they did.
I wonder if someday, we
could ever return to the
land and live in the
woods again...?

Chu 3
I like people in Shevat
because they're all nice.
They treat Chu-chus the
same as themselves...yes,
they do.
But I heard people on the
land are all scary.
They lie, say awful
things, hurt and kill
each other...

I am wrong, right? They
are all nice people, right?
    Everyone's nice.
    Not necessarily...

I knew it!
I want to go down to the
land and live with other
people, yes, I do!

————————————————————————————

I see...I hope everyone
understands each other,
and lives happily together
someday...yes, I do.

Say, I have something
really good to tell you,
I could let you in on it.
It's a deal you can't

Do you wanna know?
    Sure
    No thanks

Hmm...
I see...
You wanna know, yes you
do...
Alright, I'll tell you
about the inspirational
tradition of the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes I will.

Loooong long ago, the
Chu-chu Tribe had a great
big guardian god, who could
step over huge mountains in
one step. The Wondrous
Mambo god, yes he was!
The Chu-chu Tribe and the
Wondrous Mambo god lived
happily together in perfect
peace, yes we did. A dreamy
sweet existence.
But one day, a huuuge red
fireball rained down from
the sky, and blew away our
guardian god as he was
asleep. Blam, kablam, boom!
But don't worry!
The great big guardian god
became a star in the sky!
He protects the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes he does!!

Yes, yes, it's a great
story...No matter how
many times I listen to
it, I'm so moved...yes
I do... 
Be careful now, remember:
Bad guys that pester the
poor Chu-chus will get
punished by our guardian
god, yes they will.

Dark Gray Chu
Hmm ooh...
I see,
you want to listen...
Wha? No?
You don't wanna listen?
Are you sure?
I see. Too bad.
It really is a great
story...yes it is...

————————————————————————————

Old Pink Chu
The guys in Solaris
pestered the Chu-chu Tribe
who'd lived on this star
from the beginning.
So gramps and grandmas
escaped with the people
from Shevat, yes they did.
But most of the Chu-chus
couldn't escape and were
killed...Those guys ate
them, yes they did...
That reminds me...
I'm hungry, yes I am...
I just remembered I
haven't had lunch yet.

Young Pink Chu
Forget the guardian god
of legend. Nobody believes
such fairy tales in this
day and age...no, no.

If a great big guardian
god existed, he'd have
beaten Solaris to death a
loooong time ago, yes he
would.

Just a bunch of
optimistic, happy guys...
What are we to do about
them...

that a looooong long time
ago. Don't know what
it is, though, maybe a spell,
yes maybe it is.

Orange Chu
I hear the Sage in Shevat
did some research on the
Chu-chu Tribe's tradition,
yes he did.
That's a lot of work.
Even the old generations
of the Chu-chu Tribe don't
know many things about it.

our first date, isn't it?
I recall that on that day,
you dear, read me a poem
that you said you wrote
all by yourself...
I thought it funny that
such a romantic still
exists in our day and age...
But I was delighted by it...
Nothing has changed here...

I have a hunch the day
may not be too far away.

This city has been
wandering the sky like
this for 500 years...
Just watching the 
everchanging countries,

appeared and disappeared...
The people in Shevat lost
power, so that's all they
could do...
Being able to observe may
have been a reward for
those people here.

After all, pain only
causes more pain and

How come those guys up

Hello and welcome...
As you can see, the "Deep

just that we aren't doing
any business right now.

Look at these birds.
They have forgotten how
to fly during the long
history of evolution.

We humans are the same.
We threw away our broken
wings, and forgot how to
fly...
But I doubt it will end
like this. We'll remember
the sky again, someday.
Running into the deep,
vast blue sky forever...
The day will come again.

Don't you think so?

A part of you remains at

A fragment of you calls
for you to return.
That is why one returns

Hello, surface people.
Look at this picture.
It's me and my wife a
long time ago.

It may be hard to believe
but there was a time when
we were young too,
full of dreams and hopes.
My wife died two years ago.
So, I asked the people in
the world below to bury
her ashes in the earth.
My time will also come
soon... Could you young
people bury my ashes in
the earth for me too...?
I'm tired of...waiting...
and believing...
I want to rest in peace
in the earth.

Old Woman
But I was wondering
what it would be like to
live without getting old
like Queen Zephyr...
What has she seen,
and heard for the past
500 years?
Did what she see and
hear really bring her
happiness...?
That, I don't know.

Woman
This country's been
through a lot.
We no longer have enough
strength to fight Solaris...

You people from the
world below should go
to the royal palace.
Queen Zephyr will listen
to your wishes and show
you the way.
You may be the new hope
for those who're against
Solaris...

What's the use of having
a Gear if there's no one

The only Gear that needs
maintenance is Maria's
Gear which is hardly ever
used.

Well, to be honest with
you, we don't have any
chance in this fight...
Unless a miracle happens.
The battle was probably
settled at the point where
they let her escape in that
war 500 years ago.

Woman
This store is about to be
closed. Gears aren't
needed in this town except
the Queen's troops...
But, please take a look.

    No, we're not.

If that's the case then...
under there is a house that
no one lives in anymore.

Maria often used to go there

Why don't you check out the

Is that really
possible...?"

Zephyr
"Yes...
I and a select few of the
vassals have undergone some
special life-extending
treatments.
We were required to
continue living... Until
that final day approaches.
Because of one man...
To continue living...
This is our atonement...
for that tragedy
500 years ago..."

Zephyr
"Let us discontinue this
discussion of the past.
I've heard many things
about all of you from
Wiseman.
Wiseman has been conducting
his operations on the
surface under my orders...
...to keep an eye on that
man's activities.
Also, he was ordered to
bring anyone from the
surface who would be of
help to us to Shevat...
500 years ago we fought
against Solaris for the
freedom of the land
dwellers.
Even after that, we
continue to resist Solaris
although we are short of
any real power."

Zephyr
"Land dwellers, can you
find it in your heart
to help us?
We must free mankind from
the grasps of Solaris...
We must gain true freedom
and build a peacful world
to live in."

Fei
"I see...
You're quite right.
But, there's no guarantee
that you aren't the same
as Solaris, right?
Even if Solaris were to be
defeated, the people of the
surface may just as well
encounter a new dominator."

-ALT- Bart

Bart
"Tch.
Something's not right.
This fight for independence
from a tyrant. The battle
for freedom.
I see, you make it seem
like your intentions are
noble.
In reality though, maybe
you're no different than
Solaris?
Anyway, I'm too busy with
trying to take Aveh back
from that bastard, Shakhan.
Hate to break this to you,
but I don't have the time!"

————————————————————————————

Zephyr
"However, I tell no lie...
...when I say we are doing
this purely for the future
of the land dwellers.
If you still cannot believe
us, then defeat Solaris,
gain back the independence
of the land dwellers...
...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens
together."

...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens

The pretexts of the past,

"As for you, Elly...
Your family and friends...
You must understand that

a reason to live, a reason
to fight.
To understand better the
meaning of death...
However, that is something
we must find on our own,
and make it our own...
That is what my grandfather
said. Though I don't
understand what he meant
by it..."

Maria
"It's already been 5 years
since my grandfather
brought me to Shevat.
Grandfather and the Queen
always told me not to leave
Shevat. That I must not go
to Solaris alone...
There's no way I could
lose to any other Gear in
my Seibzehn...
There's no way...!
I'll step on all those
Solarians with
Seibzehn... Beat them
down, beat them all down!!"

Maria
"Why does grandfather and
the Queen stop me?
Don't they care what
happens to father...? Are
they just going to stand by

I can't forgive those

Guard 1
How's the surface doing,

I'm sure the people down
there are living blindly
yet peacefully as usual.

Guard 2
I seriously doubt any spy
would be able to get in.
And as I expected, since
we have new people from
the surface, there's
increased security.
And you never know what
might happen... If anything
ever happened to the Queen,
it'd be disastrous.

Woman
Welcome to Shevat. We've
already heard that you are
our guests.
Please use this room as you
please. You are welcome to

Woman in pink
The powerless are maimed
and slaughtered all because
those crazed leaders give
out one bloodlusted order.
It doesn't matter how
advanced their technology
or culture is.
It's the same thing. Not
one thing has changed over
the years.
It's gotten so sad, you can
almost laugh! Hah! How long
does this have to last...?

Old Man
This is the library where
many books are gathered.
This place is packed with
many ancient books that
you cannot find on the
surface.
If you're a book fanatic,
you'd drool over books
like our first run prints,
limited books, autograph...
...books, banned books, and
mountains of hard to find
books, and more mountains
and mountains of books...!
Ahhh! It's too much!

Well, setting that aside...
If there's something you
want to know about from the
past, it'd be good to go in
and talk to the librarians.
Don't worry. It's their
job anyway to tell the new
people from the surface
about the past.

————————————————————————————
Shevat Library - 1528
————————————————————————————

Woman 1
You're probably already
aware of this...
...but this Shevat is
protected by a special
gate made possible by
an ancient technology.
Even Solaris cannot break
this barrier. Because of
that, we were able to avoid
being invaded to this day.
But even with that, we
don't have the power to
attack Solaris either...
It's a stalemate.
Basically, we've just been
glaring at each other.

Man 1
After the war, Solaris
used a gate, like ours,
to separate itself from
the surface.
And then, they erased all
memory of their existence
from the surface dwellers.
Due to this, the surface
dwellers are still not
aware that they've been
secretly dominated by
Solaris all along.
To be born into a false
reality, to grow up in it,
and to die in it...without
ever approaching the truth.
...That is the life of a
surface dweller.

Old Man 1
Surviving through the great
war of 500 years ago and
the Diabolos Collapse...
...we and the rest of the
our comrades secluded
ourselves on Shevat.
At the time, Shevat was
being constructed at the
tip of Babel Tower...
...but we were able to
escape to the sky before
Solaris once again ascended
to power over the land.
Since then, we've been
wandering the skies, while
overlooking the activities
of the land below.

Old Man 2
Those giants which fought
long ago to save us. An
existence which surpasses
all other Gears.
They are the legendary
'Omnigears'.
One of them is the treasure
of the Aveh royal family...
...which is currently
resting somewhere within
the continent of Ignas.
But, I can't guarantee
that.

Old Lady
The reason mankind was able
to make it through and
survive certain death,
500 years ago...
...was because the power
of these giants created
through god's wisdom.
Roni Fatima and the other
young fighters piloted
these giants and destroyed
the heart of Diabolos.
Seeing an opportunity to
counterattack, mankind
desperately stood up
against Diabolos...
...and successfully
annihilated them.
Roni Fatima, Queen Zephyr
and the rest of the young
ones put their lives on the
line and won back...
...the future for this
world.

Bart
"Roni Fatima?
Isn't that my ancestor?
So you're saying my
ancestor, Roni, fought
alongside Queen Zephyr
against Solaris...?
Hmm..."

Young Man in orange
Diabolos...
The sudden appearance of the
mysterious army put a full
stop to the battle between
the humans, 500 years ago.
Those angels of death,
utterly unrivaled, with no
fear or mercy...
Their only intention was to
eradicate all life on this
planet.
Even Solaris' proudest
Gear battalions were
mere flies to them.
Nothing stopped them as
they indiscriminately
slaughtered and trampled
upon countless lives.
At that time, people were
certain that the end of the
world was approaching...
Dominated by feelings of
constant fear and
hopelessness, it was a
dreadful life...

Old Man 3
The great war that unfolded
between Solaris and Shevat,
500 years ago...
It was a heroic battle,
with the freedom and
independence of the land
dwellers at stake...
The rebel army, which
centered around Shevat...
...was successful at
attacking the inner citadel
of Solaris, but only with
tremendous sacrifices...
However, before we almost
made it, the unthinkable
happened...
A new enemy appeared that
even Solaris had not
anticipated.
That was when the nightmare
began. The nightmare never
seen before.
A nightmare that we pray we
would never have to see
again...

Woman in white
At one point, Solaris and
its Gazel Ministry made up
of 12 elders...
...dominated the world
with more military might
than they have presently.
The people on the land were
treated like slaves...
If any of them resisted,
they were quickly and
mercilessly dealt with.
They treated the people as
if they weren't living
beings.
Eventually, people on the
surface began to rebel from
all parts and ultimately...
...led to the Solaris-Shevat
War of 500 years ago.

Old Woman in pink
After the war and the
collapse of Diabolos,
similarly to the land
dwellers...
...the heavily beaten
Solaris forces began to
pull back and return to
their home country...
...taking along with them
vast numbers of land
dwellers as slaves.
We couldn't stop them.
The only way for the war
torned land dwellers to
survive was to depend on
Solaris...
After the brief moment of
hope, Solaris once again
began to reign over our
lives...
A cold and harsh era had
begun.
500 years have past and
their reign still
continues...
No one knows how long
this is going to last...

This is the tactical

Currently, we are keeping

Hmm. You think Solaris
found something?

Gray Chu
Hmhmm...
So the Anima Relics were
created by god's wisdom.
I wonder if that is
truly the case...

All in all, that unit was
meant to merge with
something inorganic.
That would be the proper
assumption...

It is foolish of humans
chu try chu depend on
such things...

Oh my, I've said chu much.
Forget what I said.

————————————————————————————

Gray Chu
Uh, and, yeah...the relic,
relic... I wonder where the
little Anima Relic went...

Man in orange
That which the Gazel Ministry
of Solaris desperately seeks...
is the 12 Anima Relics created
by god's wisdom.
The merging of an Anima Relic
and a Gear can produce an 
Omnigear...
But, the subjects must be in
suitable synchronization or
else the transformation will
not occur.
Some of the Anima Relics have
been discovered, but there are
still more left undiscovered,
sleeping deep in the earth.
Even we have been devoting
much to the search...
but, to no avail...

Man in tan
The power of the Omnigears
was so great that they could
even hold back Diabolos'
collapse 500 years ago.
If any more of these fall
into the hands of the
enemy...
Our future and even those
of the land dwellers will
be...!!
I implore you, land dwellers!
We require your assistance.
Shevat must collect the
remaining Anima Relics,
by any means necessary...!

Man
Balthasar has strongly told
Maria not to leave Shevat
under any circumstances.
He probably said that
because he knows that if
provided with the chance...
...that child would
immediately try to fly off
to Solaris...
All by herself, to rescue
her captured father,
riding on the
Seibzehn...

Woman
Maria has truly done so
much for us. As of now...
...many of us consider her
to be the guardian angel
of Shevat.
Regardless of how well
she can control
Seibzehn, she's
only a 13 years old girl.
She's probably worried sick
about her father who's been
captured by Solaris...

Man in orange robes
This land is a testing
ground for Solaris.
Their objectives are
genetic engineering,
crossbreeding, and mind
control...
They want to collect data
for the newly created 
organisms and general 
combat data.
Lambs are mere livestock
to be raised for Solaris'
purposes.
The 'Ethos' was
established mainly to
control the Lambs.

Bart
"What!?
Collecting combat data!?
Then, this war that's
lasted for hundreds of
years on the Ignas
continent...
It was just a farce 
plotted by Solaris!?"

————————————————————————————
???

Man in orange robes
It's not a farce.
To them, it's an important
simulation under strict
restrictions.
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

————————————————————————————

Man in orange robes
They're not doing this
for fun, either.
It's an important
simulation.
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

Fei
"..."

Woman??? blonde hair
The scientists of Solaris
had bitter experiences in
the revolt by the Lambs
500 years ago. 
So they decided to do
some work on the Lambs.
They inserted various
Limiters so that they would
never be able to revolt.
For the past 500 years,
Solaris controlled the
Lambs' consciousness,
behavior and all.
Naturally, Lambs don't
know anything about it.
That makes it even more
unforgivable!! Although
it's highly efficient...

Man in gray coat
A man named Krelian was
the mastermind behind
the planting of the
Limiter in the Lambs.
He was originally a Lamb.
He learned molecular
engineering from the sage,
Melchior, personally.
But he misused it for
such a terrible act!
An unbelievable monster!

Woman???
The whereabouts of the three
sages, Melchior, Balthasar
and Gaspar have not been
known since the great war.
There's even a rumor that
they lost faith in humans
because of the tragedy in
Nisan.
Solaris' activities have
increased once again...
I wonder where they are
and what they're up to.

Old Man
The Limiter restrains the
Lambs' abilities. But there
may be a way to remove it.
Taura Melchior, he used
to be one of the three 
sages of Shevat.
He must know a way to
remove the Limiter.

Man in orange robes
You land dwellers better
think seriously about it.
The Lambs'll continue to
be Solaris' guinea pigs
unless someone stops them.

barbaric phase like the
land dwellers!

————————————————————————————
Shevat Prison - 1540

Old Man
This is where we keep the
criminals in their cells.
It's been said that
soldiers from Solaris were
locked up in here long ago.
I've heard we've even done
many atrocious things at
that time. 
War is like that. It
abolishes good and bad.
One betrays friends,
neighbors, even his own
flesh and blood...
War turns even good, kind
humans into crazed monsters.

Man
This is a Carbonite Cage
that petrifies humans
alive. Regardless of
whether it was only used
on criminals, it is still
heinous.
No matter how you look at
it, they've sure thought
of cruel things.

By the way, you land
dwellers know about the
Nisan tragedy during
the great war?
Did you hear anything
from the higher ups?
    Yes
    No

I'm surprised they told
you. So, you know what it
is, don't you?
Don't believe everything
those old men say.
Nothing good will come
of it.

————————————————————————————

Man
I doubt they told you.
Those old men politely
avoid talking about it.
Do they think the truth
will disappear if they
turn away from the past?
Bunch of fools!

Be careful, land dweller.
You'll have a terrible time
if you open up your heart 
to those old men.
Just like they did in
Nisan, 500 years ago...

Old Woman
That day, 500 years ago,
that woman was definitely
here...There was no other
alternative but to be a
captive...
We could've won, at the
cost of many sacrifices!
Only if that traitor
hadn't disappeared with
the woman!!
The escaped woman freed the
beast. The beast sucked
human blood and ate their
flesh...
And tore the world apart...!

Excuse me...Miss...
You resemble the girl who
was like an angel, and
was sacrificed in the
great war...
I can picture Zephyr and
the followers' confusion.
They were the ones who
were actually responsible
for the death of Sophia.
In actuality, we are still
being punished for that
crime, 500 years ago!
It feels almost
ridiculous, hahah...!

————————————————————————————
???

Old Woman???
Since then, people have
found themselves groping
in the dark.
They've been atoning for a
crime for 500 years...

careful, young one. Don't
follow the same path as
the traitor...drowning in
hatred and love...

That great war 500 years

Many lives were lost...
Much love, many dreams,
friends, those...
...irreplaceably important
things in our lives were
scarred and left to
bleed...
Are those days going to
return once again...?
I don't want my children or

that nightmare...

Man 1
We've been flying up in
the sky, right?
It isn't easy getting
supplies. We can't just
go and get all our own
supplies either.
We made it this far
somehow, but if the
situation continues like
this...Hmm...we'd better
do something...

Man 2
Hmm...this month is going
to be very tight too. We
must cut down on rations
a little to make it...
But everyone will
probably gripe about
that...
What am I gonna do...?

Aveh Soldier
Uuhhh, so hungry... Is the
meal ready yet? Whatever
you do, it all goes back to
food. You got that? Food!
For me, I get the feeling
I'm most alive when I'm
eating. Isn't it the same
with you guys?
You eat to live or live to
eat. We don't even know,
do we?
I bet those Solarians are
always eating all the good
stuff. Argh!
That's unforgivable!!

Man
We're still running around
in the sky because of the
war that broke out 500
years ago. It doesn't make
any sense!
Why do we have to suffer
for what our ancestors
did? What do you think?
I can't even get fresh
ingredients for meals!
I've had it!

Yui
"Oh, welcome.
You look good, Fei.
The meal will be ready
soon. Please join us and
eat to your heart's
content."

Fei
"...!?
Yui!?
W...why,
are you here...!?"

Yui
"Oh? Didn't I tell you
before? I was born here.
After you left the village,
I decided to return to
Shevat along with the
survivors of the village.
Because the soldiers from
Aveh and Kislev were
showing up around there
..."

Fei
"I see..."

Yui
"Welcome back."

Fei
"I'm sorry for putting so
much trouble on you."

Yui
"What are you saying?
It's not your fault.
There's nothing to worry
about.
The people from the village
understood after they came
here and heard the story.
They couldn't blame only you
for that incident because
Solaris was behind it."

Fei
"Yes...
but..."

Bart
"Excuse me...but...
who's this lady?"

Fei
"Oh, you've never met her
before. This is doc's
wife, Yui."

Bart
"The wife of Citan!?"

Yui
"Aha, I take it...
you are Bart, the Orca of
the Desert, right?
I've heard a lot about you.
You've been quite busy.
It's nice to meet you."

Bart
"Y...yes!
H...how do you do!"

Yui
"Have you met the Queen?
If you haven't, go say
hello to her as soon as
possible."

Fei
"Okay!
Then I'll see you later."

Midori
"...
Chu-chu...
My friend..."

Orange Chu
Midori really talks a
lot! It's amazing how
much stuff you have
chu talk about.

We can have a conversation
without talking. Have you
forgotten already?

Man
Oh, and you are...?
I feel like I've met you
before...
Hmm...you resemble Kahn,
the one who taught us the
art of fighting.
Nobody knows his
whereabouts after he went
down to the surface on
the Queen's mission...
I doubt something bad
happened to him considering
his skills.
But, I wonder where he is?

Aveh Soldier
You just arrived from
the surface, didn't
you?
I've heard about you.
They say you saved our
colleague captured by the
'Ethos'. Thank you very
much for that.

I wish they'd give me a
mission! 
I'd teach those
Solarians a lesson...

Woman
Krelian holds the true
power in Solaris is what
I'm saying... The irony
of fate.
Once, that man fought
alongside Roni Fatima,
Queen Zephyr and Lacan
against Solaris...

Man
To protect Shevat from the
outside, the ancient
technology of the Gate is
used.
It's fundamentally the same
thing as the stuff Solaris
has planted on the surface.
Even with Solaris'
technology, the Gate cannot
be broken through.
But at times, I come to
think about whether this
Gate is only for protecting
us from Solaris?
Maybe that man left this
Gate behind to separate us.
To isolate us from the rest
of the world.
If that was his intention,
then Krelian is indeed
dreadful... Does that man's
resentment run that deep...

Man 1
Maria's father, Doctor
Nikolai, was captured by
Solaris and nothing has
been heard from him since.
In any case, I'm sure he's
being forced to do research
on Gears...
If they develop 
Seibzehn further into
a new Gear weapon, and start
mass-producing them...
Well, to say the least,
it would be more than we
could ever handle...

Man 2
Balthasar brought Maria to
Shevat about 5 years ago,
along with that
Seibzehn.
Balthasar said he sneaked
into Solaris by himself
and tried to save
Dr. Nicola and Maria.
He laughed as he told me
that he managed to escape
with Maria, and take that
Seibzehn as a
souvenir.

Man 1
Long ago, humans were with
god in a paradise in the
sky called Mahanon. The
place was protected by the
power of god. Humans were
never exposed to the fear
or danger of death.
However, one day, humans
entered god's forbidden
garden and ate a fruit
which bestowed upon them
tremendous intelligence
and power.
God found out about the
incident and the humans
were banished from the
paradise. The prosperous
times were over, an era of
sorrow and hatred began...

That was the first part
of the legend of genesis
that was passed on from
long ago. They say a
legend such as this
contains some truth to
it...

Man 2
Humans banished from the
paradise were foolish
enough to revolt against
god.
In order to resist the
power of god, they
created twelve Anima
Relics, and called
themselves gods...
For 10 days, 10 nights,
the world shed its blood,
Mahanon was enveloped in 
flames.
But human strength was no
match for god and the
arrogant humans were
destroyed by god's anger.
Only a few righteous men
were left on the land.
However, god was also
tired and wounded.
He decided to rest in the
deepest depths of the
earth.
God's rest was long.
But eternity is only
a moment to god.
Since then, the righteous
men who didn't revolt
against god had to live
in the harsh nature by
themselves, being in
constant fear of death...

The legend also says the
following:
When the righteous men's
children are born again,
god will awaken from his
long rest and give a
helping hand to them.
If the legend is true,
what will the awakening
god bring to the people?
What kind of existence is
god?

Man 3
It is not known how much of
the genesis legend is true
...
However, the 'Anima Relics'
made through god's wisdom,
do exist.
Solaris' Gazel Ministry is
desperate to find the
'Anima Relic' and Mahanon,
a place known to be god's
resting place.
If Solaris attains that
power, no one will be able
to stop them.
What will happen to the
world then...?

Old Man
Ahh...I see,
so you're the son of Kahn.
Have you met Queen Zephyr
yet?
She still can't forget
about the tragedy in Nisan
during the great war, 500
years ago. Even though
it's not her fault...
I assume she can't forgive
herself for betraying and
abandoning her fellow 
members though she had no
knowledge of what was
going on...

Oh, I may have said too
much. I'm not supposed to
know anything. Anyhow,
keep up the good work in
overthrowing Solaris,
young man!

Old Man
Keep it up the good work
in overthrowing Solaris.
I'm counting on you.

Man with long hair
So you're the newcomers
from the surface? Hmm...
It seems you all aren't
like the usual land
dwellers we get.
But we're always happy to
have more friends to fight
against Solaris.
I look forward to working
with you.
