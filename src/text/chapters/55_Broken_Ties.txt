Fei
"I heard about it from
doc.
Id...
...Who would've ever
thought within me, lies
another me..."

Elly
"But you're the same Fei
I've always known.
You returned to your old
self. Please don't be
obsessed with it."

Fei
"They say I'm the second
advent of Grahf.
The one who destroyed all
of this world...
It seems Grahf used to be
a land dweller named
Lacan..."

Elly
"They're not thinking
about what they're
saying!
They're just confused by
your powers!"

Fei
"Grahf called me the one
who would destroy god
In a way, I can
understand what he means
now.
Though my Id power isn't
good enough, if it has
the same quality as
Grahf's...I..."

Elly
"Let's escape.
If Grahf, or the war
brings out Id, let's
go to a place where
no wars exist."

Fei
"If you did that, 
you'd be..."

Elly
"That's alright...
I don't have a place to
go back, either..."

Fei
"Thanks Elly, but no.
Even if I left the
battle field, there's
no guarantee that Id'll
never appear again.
Besides...
I tried to kill you...
You're still okay with
that?"

Elly
"Then you could've killed
me if you really wanted
to, right?
The other you, Id's power
is nothing like that.
But you still didn't go
through with it.
You knew when it was
enough. Isn't that
because your will was in
effect?"

Elly
"If you're to be controlled
by Id and all those around
you became your enemies...
I'd still be by your side.
...Because...
Because...I know it's
lonely to be by yourself."

Let's go, Fei."

Citan??? (*???add*)
I thought it was about
time for you to come...

Elly
"It's no use trying
to stop me.
Even if it is you,
if you get in my way,
I have no choice but
to...!!"

Citan
"That is no way for a lady
to speak. I just came here
to see you off."

Elly (*???add*)
?

Citan
"I refueled Weltall.
We are ready to go
anytime."

Elly
"...Citan."

Citan
"...But, Elly, you cannot
use your Gear while it is
under repairs."

Elly
"What? Then what am I...?"

Citan
"You know that Omnigear...
What if you borrow it..."

Fei
"No way. I can't take
Shevat's property
without permission..."

Citan
"Elly is the only
appropriate person
for the Gear.
Nobody else can
operate it."

Elly (*???add*)
No...

Elly
"Never!!
I won't ride it, ever!!"

Fei
"Elly...?
What's wrong?"

Elly
"I'm so scared...
That's why... I'll
never want to do it!!"

Citan
"This is a problem..."

Margie??? (*???add*)
How about if I
ride with you?

Fei
"Everyone...?"

Bart
"Sorry...Fei."

Billy
"I'm sorry..."

Margie
"Sorry..."

Fei
"No...
Thanks, everyone."

Citan
"Now, I know you hate to
leave, but we should get
going before dawn.
I did some work on the
radar, so it
should work fine!"

Citan
"...They have left..."

Emeralda
"Fei...where..."

Citan
"They went far away."

Emeralda
"I...go..."

Blue 4 (*???add*)
Cain...
Making a ridiculous
setup with Hyuga...

Red 3
He certainly has his
deficiencies compared to
our digitized existence,
which permits us to use
a higher level of
logical thinking...

Red 1
He is restricted by his
human form.

Blue 3
Regardless...with
just one machine, he
annihilated Etrenank...
His powers must not be
underestimated...

Red 2
We're already short of
time. The key,
use the key...

Krelian
"Even you are beginning
to feel the pressure?"

Blue 1
Krelian... What
is Cain's situation?

Krelian
"The usual life extension
treatment. He'll hold out
for... a little
longer..."

Blue 2
Does that mean we may
not make it in time...?

Krelian
"I wouldn't know...
You spoke of using the key.
Can you be sure he
can be eliminated?"

Red 2
That we do not know.
You know who he is...

Red 3
If he is the 'contact',
there is a possibility
he may not transmigrate.

Red 4
It's an organism
composed of multiple
generations. It's a
matter of probability.

Blue 1
That does not mean we
can just remain idle.

Blue 4
Yes. At this rate we
are bound to make the same
mistake. But we can't fail
a second time.

Krelian
"Well don't worry. I've
sent Ramsus to deal with
him."

Red 4
What can a failure
like him do?

Red 1
He couldn't even defend
Etrenank. What can you
expect from 'trash'
like him.

Krelian
"Even if he has the
'Anima Relic'?"

Blue 2
The 'Relic'...?

Krelian
"The relic we recovered
before has been aligned
with his Gear.
There shouldn't be
any problems now. He
should be able to use
his full power."

Blue 3
You're going to take
the task yourself?
Although he transmigrated,
wasn't he once one of you?
I don't understand you.

Krelian
"I've thrown away all
feelings of human emotion.
All I need is 'her'."

Blue 4
But isn't that
also an emotion?

Krelian
"...Of course."

Blue 2
Is that a
blunder...

Krelian
"You are irritating...
Do you wish to cease your
existence?"

Blue 1
Fine. We shall leave
it at that.

Solaris Skies - Ramsus Pursues - 1832

Ramsus
"Elhaym...?"

Krelian
"Yes. This is the place.
I want you to
bring her here.
She is an important woman
to me."

Ramsus
"Don't be ridiculous.
Why do I have to
listen to you?
If you need her,
go get her yourself!"

Krelian
"You're quite right.
But, can you say
the same thing
after looking at this?"

Ramsus
"Th, this is..."

Krelian
"Your Gear and the
Anima Relic have been
aligned...
This is the Omnigear.
Now, she is
with Fei now."

Ramsus
"What!?"

Krelian
"Losing those battles
against Fei again and
again...
I believe it's because of
the difference
in the performance
of the Gears.
I think you'll be
able to use 100% of it's
abilities.
So how about it?
However, if you still fail
with this,
you are truly 'trash'."

Ramsus
"..."

Krelian
"Ramsus, will you go?"

Miang
"Kahr, are you going?"

Ramsus
"Yes.
I must get rid of him
with my own hands."

Miang
"Be careful.
I believe in you
no matter what others say."

'Fei'!
What a loathsome name.
I worked my way up on
my own.
But he ruined it again...

Ramsus
"!?
That signal...!
It's him!
I'm not trash!
I'm not worthless!!"

Fei
"What kinda...Gear is 
that...?"

Elly (*???add*)
!!

Elly
"Omnigear!!
And according to the
readings...
It's clearly different from 
the one Bart's using or
the one in Shevat...
...You think it's the!?
Perfect Gear!?"

Fei (*???add*)
Perfect Gear...?

Elly
"Remember what Citan said?
He said that
the Omnigears are controlled
by mental waves.
The power...the potential
varies depending on the
rate of synchronism.
The numbers indicate
complete synchronization."

Ramsus
"Slow, too slow!"

Elly
"They're catching up with
us!!"

Ramsus
"Your performance is sad!"

Ramsus
"Hmph...
I knew you'd be there."

Fei
"Ramsus!?"

Ramsus
"Turn Lt. Elhaym
over to me, Fei!"

Fei
"What!? Why do we have to
turn Elly over to
you...!?
Oh, I get it, it's
Krelian's idea, isn't it?
I don't think so!
You can't expect me
to comply!"

Ramsus
"I can take her by force,
if you wish.
But then,
don't ever expect to be
able to hold her in your
arms ever again!"

Elly (*???add*)
Fei!!

Fei
"Don't worry.
I'll protect you."

Ramsus
"Impressive words.
Fei, I intend to
take everything away
from you!!"

Ramsus
"This is your final
warning. Hand over
Lt. Elhaym, now!"

Fei
"I refuse to!"

Ramsus
"Are you sure you
want to refuse me?
It'll be too late
for you to change
your mind later!"

Fei
"Stop your stupid
boasting!"

Ramsus
"Humm... Well then,
I'll have to show you
if I'm boasting or not!
So be it.
No holding back!
And no holds barred!"

Ramsus
"Come on, come on!
What poor form!
What's wrong, Fei!?
In the presence of
my 'Vendetta', your
Weltall is but
only a infant!"

Ramsus
"Incredible!
This undeniable
difference in power!
Miang!
Are you watching this!?"

Ramsus
"At this rate...
And with this power,
I can defeat him!"

Ramsus
"Hm Hm Hm Hm Hmm...
Wah hah hah hah hah!"

Elly
"...
Ramsus, listen!
I surrender!!
So please stop
attacking us
this instant!"

Fei
"What are you saying!?
If you do that..."

Elly
"It is me he wants!
I can't drag you into
danger just over me!"

Elly
"Eeeeyaaah!"

Elly
"Stop attacking!
Ramsus!
If I'm what you want,
then just take me!"

Ramsus
"Hyah hah hah hah hah!
Win! I can win! I am
not the worthless one!!"

Fei
"Ramsus...!?
Can't you
hear us...?"

Elly
"He's lost himself in
the overwhelming power
of that gear of his...
Fei, we had
better run!"

Ramsus
"It's over for you!
Fei Fong Wong!"

Fei
"Uuaaaaaahhhhhh!!"
Elly
"Eeeeyyyaaahhhh!!"

Ramsus
"Nuah hah hah hah! I am
not the worthless one!
Hah! Uha, haah... haah
... Huh?"

Ramsus
"!!
I've even taken out
the lieutenant too...
Damn,
I forgot my orders...
Hmph...
Oh well...
To hell with
Krelian's orders..."

At this rate Elly's not
