Sigurd
"I see. So, Fei'll recover
if he continues to rest.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It seems the orphanage is
located to the southeast of
the 'Ethos' headquarters."

Sigurd
"Shall we launch
the Yggdrasil?"
    Go ahead!
    Wait a while.

Little Boy 1
Can't see the flying
saucer today. Aa~h!

Wanna know about the flying
saucer? Then just ask me!
    Tell me
    Nevermind

Ahem!!
Actually it was a long time
ago. About 50 years ago, an
old man, Henry Mingas, said
he was taken by the saucer
and his body was altered.
Well, no one believed him,
but afterward it's said he
had amazing knowledge and
skills he never had before.
Then 10 years ago, strange
circle shaped marks were
found in many places.
You must've heard about it.
No? Well anyway, they were
called mystery circles. So
this guy spread rumors that
they were saucer landing
sites, and when others
began to disappear, there
was even more talk. But
there were other things
than the saucer landing site
explanation, such as the
Naughty Stories, Dragon
Scrolls, or Plasma Legend.
So there was no real proof.
But real disappearances
did happen.

Oh, I forgot to mention,
the saucer was called
'Shevat'.
There are even people
who worship it.

So, was that of any use?
Ahem.

Little Boy 2
Why's the air so salty?
Isn't there any fresh air
around here?
If there is I want to
inhale till I'm full.

Little Boy 3
Huh? 'Why aren't you
playing with them?'
Don't be silly...!
I can't play with girls!!

Elly
"Well then, are you
saying I can't play
because I'm a girl?"

Little Boy 3
You're okay!

Hey hey 
get on this!

Green Girl

Where is everyone hiding?

Little Boy 4
It's like something's
in there, but you can't
go inside.
Some kind of haunted
house?
...shiver...

"Oh, how are you?
How is Fei doing?"

Elly
"Very well.
He hasn't regained 
consciousness yet, but he
should come around soon."

Billy
"Really? 
That's good to hear."

Elly
"Um, Billy. 
I don't know quite how to
thank you for helping Fei." 

Billy
"Don't mention it.
We may believe in 
different gods, but
none of us can leave
people in need."

Elly
"Thank you very much. 
By the way is this 
your orphanage...?"

Billy
"Surprised there are 
only children?"

Billy
"My sister and I haven't
had parents since we were
infants... 
So I opened an orphange
so kids without anyone
wouldn't have to go 
through what we did."

Billy
"They're all healthy and
obedient to the teachings
of the 'Ethos'.
They're all good kids who
even help me with work."

Hey you, in the black

Are you Sigurd?

Sigurd
"Is that any way to speak
to someone?
Who do you think you are?"

Citan
"Ah... He may not look
it but he is our senior."

Sigurd
"Senior?
Jessie?"

Billy
"Siggy?"

Bart
"He said Siggy?"

Jessie
"A silver haired man
with amber skin.
I'd say that's rare.
What are you all doing 
here?"

Citan
"It just sort of happened."

Sigurd
"A lot's happened..."

Jessie
"Well, let's talk about 
things over some drinks.
So...
Why are you all here?"

Billy
"Siggy,
it's been a long time...
What's with the eye patch?"

Sigurd
"Billy...
you've grown up.
With that smile you look 
just like Racquel."

Bart
"Hey!
Hey hey hey!
Who are you? 
Get all cozy with my 
officers, huh?
And what's all this
'Siggy' stuff? 
Don't get cute, kid!"

Billy
"What's with you?
Why are you so
arrogant to Siggy?
Who do you think
you are?"

Jessie
"Billy. 
Don't yell at
Sigurd's people.
It's bad form, boy."

Sigurd
"Bart, this was my senior
when I was a candidate 
for Elements in Jugend.
I rented a room in his 
house."

Jessie
"Back then he was still
in diapers...
and he's still a whiny
little brat now."

Billy
"You're probably still
in diapers, aren't you?"

Bart
"You punk!
What's your problem?"

Jessie
"Well...then, shall
we go straight off and
drink ourselves under?"

Sigurd
"Where do you plan
on going...?"

Jessie
"What do you mean?
There has to be a bar or
two on board your ship!"

Sigurd
"I have a slight 
headache..."

Jessie
"What?
That's OK.
We'll get rid of that
headache with a good
drink."

Citan
"What are you going to do?"

Sigurd
"I can't just say no to
him..."

Let's go!"

Hey, read me this book...
    Alright!
    Maybe next time!

Ye~y!!

<Perso1>
"Long, long ago there was
a woman named Zephyr. 
She wanted to be a god
so she built a tower that
reached up to heaven.
Then she built a city at
the top. But god got mad
and destroyed her tower.
So she then had to live
in a 'hideout for sinful
hermits'.
After that she never 
returned to the earth
again... The end."

Is there really a
'Hideout for
skinful termites'?
It sounds scary!

————————————————————————————

Demi-human Boy
You made a promise now!
If you don't read it to me
next time then that's a lie!
And if you lie, you have to
stick a needle in your eye!

"..."

Little Boy
Sounds good, huh?
My Dad gave me this bell
so I would never get lost.
But my dad has no sense of
direction and gets lost a
lot too! So he also has
the same kind of bell.
He went to the 'Ethos'
headquarters but never
came back...
He must have gotten lost
on the way...
He's so silly!

What? 
That bell...
How did you get that?
Hey, you didn't happen
to meet my dad, did you?
Where is he?

Rico
"..."

(Oh-no! 
That wasn't...
his father...!?)

Rico
"Listen son! Your father's
gone to a faraway place...
Here, this is his bell!"

Little Boy
My father's a liar!!
He said we would go away
and live by ourselves...
just the two of us...
I've waited...so long...
Oh, Daddy...why?
Boo-hoo-hoo!

Primera
"..."

Little Boy
Sob, sob...
But...thanks.
Thanks for bringing  
Dad's bell back.
It'll cheer me up...!!

As thanks I'll give you
my dad's favorite book.

Received the ''Ethos'
  Doctrine Book'.

Bishop Stone
"Oh...
By the way, about your
earlier message..."

Billy
"Yes, 
about work..."

Bishop Stone
"Yes.
The 'Ethos' transport ship
that went missing finally
turned up. 
But, there's no reply..."

Billy
"What does it mean?"

Bishop Stone
"Hmmm,
perhaps Reapers again.
Billy can you do 
the usual?"

Billy
"Right,
no problem. 
Leave it to me, Bishop."

Bishop Stone
"Thanks.
It's to the northeast
from here.
Please be careful.
It's a dangerous area.
There are some pretty
fast sea currents and
it's best to stay away
from the Salvagers.
You'd better go in
a big ship..."

Bart
"Hey, is that the massive
ship Sig was talking
about earlier?"

Billy
"I don't know if that
was it or not."

Bart
"From what I hear, it's a
place where the currents
are really fast.
It's supposedly very
dangerous for small ships.
But the Yggdrasil will be
safe there.
No matter how big the wave
or swell, it's no problem.
Besides, we have help from
Fei.
Let's get aboard.
I'll see you off to there.
What, we could even help
you finish your job!"

Elly
"I agree. You saved Fei.
It's the least we could
do."

Billy
"Thanks but this doesn't
involve you.
Just me is enough."

Elly
"But isn't that place 
dangerous?
If there is anything 
we can do to help..."

Billy
"I don't want to get 
you involved..."

Bishop Stone
"Billy, my son, don't waste
their good intentions.
That sub is theirs, no?
Why don't you cooperate
with them..."

Billy
"...
But, Bishop!"

"Yeah, it's no fun
to travel alone.
Let's help."

Well if you insist.
Thank you.
I appreciate it."

Billy, take care

Report back to headquarters

Bart

Is that enough?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ??? Bart not in Party

Rico
"You're dressed lightly.
Is that enough?"

————————————————————————————

Billy
"We Etones have some
rather unique equipment.
Let me explain about the
equipment since we're 
going to be working
together."

Billy
"First of all, my basic
equipment are guns.
There're three kinds...
'Handgun',
'Ether-gun',
and 'Big-gun'.
The handgun is the only one
that can be replaced with
other versions of the same
kind.
I made the other two kinds
of guns myself, so there
are no others to replace
them with.
You can power-up a gun's
attack force by changing
its 'ammo' or 'bullets'
with more powerful ones!
To load ammo, press Right
or Left on the Directional
button at the Equip Menu
Screen.
This will display a sub-
window in place of the
main Equip window, where
you can select your ammo.
One thing you have to be
careful of is that the
number of bullets for
each gun is limited.
To successfully manage your
ammo, you must keep an
ample supply and reload
frequently!
But now that I have said
this, note that Ether-guns
do not have such a limit.
Well that's about it...
Did you understand?
    Yes
    No, please explain again

Bart
"I understood it roughly.
But it's a bit complicated,
isn't it?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ??? Bart not in Party

Rico
"...I see.
That's very unique..."

————————————————————————————

Billy
"...This is a fine gun
indeed. I'm sure it has
a significant history."

Bart
"Of course!
It's the famous rifle
'Machiganater', handed down
in the Fatima family."

Billy
"What a waste...
It's too good for you who
just brandishes a whip..."

Bart
"Hey!
Why are you getting
sharp with me!?"

Billy
"Oh, sorry... It's just...
I didn't think you would
have an interest in guns."

Elly
"Well anyway...
Billy...
I'd like to know why you
became an Etone..."

Bart
(I'm not interested...)

Billy
"...
Hmm, I see...
Etones help out strangers,
so I suppose that would
make you curious..."

Elly
"No, I don't mean that.
I'm curious about your own 
intentions, personally.
I don't know...
I just didn't expect you
to be an Etone at all..."

Billy
...

Billy
"I see...
Well, since our job is
rather unusual, I'll tell
you about that too as I
explain..."

————————————————————————————
Billy's Story - 1270
————————————————————————————

Billy
How old was I...?
I don't remember.
Maybe 8 or 9. 
About then,
dad taught me
how to use a gun.

One day
dad disappeared.

He just ran out on us.

He never came back.

Even so,
I stayed in his room alone
often.
Dad's gun, 
Dad's smell.
Those things were all
I had left to
remind me of him.

But that happiness 
didn't last long...

When I was 12,
my house was attacked
by Reapers
and mom was killed.
They were looking for dad
but mom wouldn't talk.

I can still hear it... 
The sound of the bullets
slowly firing three times...
I even remember the sound
of the empty shells
hitting the floor.
After that,
the Reapers screamed
and I heard someone fall.

Bishop Stone was the one 
who helped us then.
Meeting him changed my life
from then on.

Bart
"Hey, hey, wait a sec. 
Do Reapers talk?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- No Bart

Citan
"Wait a minute. 
Reapers spoke in a human
language?"

————————————————————————————

Billy
"Yes.
They're not just monsters.
Some of them are more
intelligent than humans."

Primera and I hid in the
shadows escaping death,
but she hasn't spoken a
word since. 

Like a godsend, kind,
strong Bishop Stone gave
me an example to follow.
I wanted to help save
someone in need like
he saved us.
I didn't want there to
be any more children
like Primera...
So I began training at the
'Ethos' to become just
like Bishop Stone.

I left Prim in the care
of the 'Ethos' and
entered the monastery.

Many years passed...

I finished training
at the monastery and
became an Etone.

I returned home to
open the orphange...

And he...had
unexpectedly come back.

But he was different.
Some terrible accident
changed him. 
Not only his looks, but
his character and manner
had entirely changed too.
I remembered him as a
quiet man...

But... more than that,
I thought maybe I didn't 
really remember him...

That's why...
I can never think of him
as a father...

But Prim needed a father, 
and she'd become attached
to him.
Deep in my heart, I too
thought I wanted a father.

But...
even now I just can't 
believe he is my real 
father.

————————————————————————————
Yggdrasil II Gun Room - 1182
————————————————————————————

Billy
"Hah!
This is going to sound
pathetic, but...
I almost went so far as
to sell my body to support
Prim, since we only had
each other for so long...
Despite that, Prim still
prefers the father that she
never knew... The one who
suddenly appeared out of
nowhere..."

Bart
"'Almost sold your body'!?
Don't you know, kid...!?
There're things you can
get back once sold, and
there are things you just
can't!
Couldn't you see that!?"

Billy
"Of course I refrained.
But they said they'd give
me 3000G for one night..."

Bart
"You fool! Listen... Next
time you and your sister
need help, come to my ship.
We're self-sufficient, so
at least you don't need to
worry about food and a
place to sleep!
Now, don't you ever say
'sell your body' in front
of me ever again...!
You understand!?"

"Could this be...?
Maybe you are a 'nice
guy' after all...?"

Bart
"Why don't you just
come out and say
'thank you'? Geez!"

Billy
"Uh...errh...well...
you haven't taken care of
us yet, so I won't say it!"

Bart
Cute, kid, REAL cute!

But they said they'd

There are three types of
guns that are standard
equipment for you...
 Handgun,
 Ether-gun,
 Big-gun.
The only gun that can be
re-equipped is the handgun.
You can power-up guns by
upgrading their respective
'ammo' or 'bullets'.
Equipping ammo is done by
pressing the Left or Right
Directional button at the
equipment menu screen.
Doing this will switch the
equipment window to a sub-
window where you can change
the type of ammo you use.
There is one thing you have
to be careful of... There
is a only a finite amount
of each type of ammo!
Hence, it is important to
keep an ample supply of
ammo in reserve and reload
as often as possible.
The only exception to this
is the Ether gun, which can
be shot an unlimited amount
of times.
