"I am sorry.
I did not want to say
anything until I was sure.
I was on a secret mission
by orders of Emperor Cain
to monitor Fei.
He ordered me to determine
whether Fei would be a
threat to the world or not.
'The Contact'...
That is what the Emperor
calls Fei..."

Emperor
"This is your 
conclusion...?"

Citan
"Yes, your Majesty.
This is the answer
that I chose myself."

Emperor
"Anonelbe...
You think you can do it?"

Citan
"Yes.
Humans have the
potential. Managers
are no longer needed."

Emperor
"The contact is not
our enemy?"

Citan
"Yes, as you say your
Majesty, if Fei is..."

Emperor
"Then I leave it up
to you...
I atone for my crime
by doing so..."

Citan
"'Anonelbe'...
The long awaited man of
god, who will take the
people born in this world
with him to a new horizon.
Such is the destiny of
the 'Contact'.
That is what the emperor
called Fei...
He did not tell me why he
called Fei that though..."

Sigurd
"Who the heck is he then?"

Citan
"He is Fei.
But he is also the one
who...
destroyed Elru, caused Kahr
serious injury, sank the
Yggdrasil, killed Rico's
subordinate's in Kislev... (??? punctuation error)
...
Need I continue further?
He is...
...Id.

Sigurd
"What did you say!?
Id!?"

Jessie
"What do you mean?"

Citan
"He...Fei that is, has
Disassociative Identity
Disorder...
Also known more commonly as
multiple personalities."

Jessie
"D...disas...?"

Citan
"Disassociative Identity
Disorder...
or multiple personalities.
It is a mental disorder
where one person has
multiple personalities."

Sigurd
"That can't be real..."

Citan
"Oh but it is very real!
Fei is living proof of it.
I have been watching over
Fei, who has a destroyer
personality within him
named 'Id'."

Citan
"In the beginning he was
stable...
His disassociation did not
occur at all while he
lived in Lahan for those
three years.
But then, after Lahan was
attacked, things changed.
Little by little, the
number of incidences of his
disassociation and their
length began to increase.
And then at Solaris, a
complete manifestation
of Id occurred."

Sigurd
"What brought it about?
He was fine when he
was in Lahan, right?"

Citan
"My guess is that...
the appearance of Grahf
affected Fei somehow.
You probably know that Fei
worked with Grahf as the
assasin 'Id' before he was (-ERROR- spelling???)
brought to live in Lahan.
It was then that Elru,
the homeland of Dominia,
was utterly obliterated.
Grahf was intentionally
provoking the manifestation
of Id 'within'...for want
of a better word...Fei."

Jessie
"For what purpose?"

Citan
"To destroy God...
That is what Grahf
was saying...
That is all I know...
Although there might be
more to it...
But one thing is certain...
Grahf was encouraging the
manifestation of Id, but
did not have adequate
control over him."

Sigurd
"In other words, it
was too much for him
to handle?"

Citan
"Yes."

Jessie
"You said, 'That's all you
know, although there might
be more to it.'...
What did you mean by that?"

Citan
"I shall go on to explain
that now. Actually, that is
the most important point."

Citan
"...There is nothing
you can do."

Id
"You understand well.
Just as I expected, Citan,
...or was it 'doc'?"

Citan
"I have been wanting to
meet you, Id. I wanted to
talk with you.
I guess it is all due to
this machine which cuts the
nerve connections.
Anyway, what is Fei doing
as of now?"

Id
"Fei?
Which Fei do you mean?"

Citan
"There is more than one?"

Id
"..."

Citan
"Id?"

Id
"The one you call Fei is
asleep."

Citan
"Sleeping?"

Id
"When I am awake, he sleeps.
That is why he has no
memory of what I do."

Citan
"Why does he not know?"

Id
"It's obvious.
He is my subordinate.
He cannot peer into my
memories. He should not,
in actuality, even exist.
That man forcibly created
his personality.
Fei is a tenant in the
room of cowardice..."

Citan
"That man?"

Id
"Our father, Khan.
He sealed up my personality
in the deepest recesses of
my consciousness.
Through some inexplicable
reason, that is when the
present Fei was born."

Citan
"When you said cowardice,
what did you mean?"

Id
"...
Why ask about him?
You think you can do
something?"

Citan
"It is rare to be able to
talk a real schizophrenic.
As a scholar, I am extremely
intrigued."

Id
"With friends like you...
eh, doctor?
I like you, Citan.
But, he is insignificant.
After all, he is just a
failure. A coward like
him does not deserve to
be 'Fei's existence'.
A pathetic one who has
always fled from reality.
He never did one thing
against me when I control
him.
A coward who refused to
live.
He should've been erased.
But he continues to exist!
Why won't he disappear?
Dammit...it makes my skin
crawl just being in the
same body as him."

Citan
"Let us change the subject.
I would like to know how
and why your personalities
were split.
Since you are the one in
control, I would assume
you would know the story.
Normally, personalities do
not split as they did with
you.
Unless there was some sort
of past trauma."

Id
"You want me to talk about
my memories? Don't 
misunderstand.
I haven't given you the
right to question me.
Just because I'm held down
by this machine, don't
push your luck.
If I really wanted to, I
could break the restraints
and crush you.
Don't you forget it."

Citan
"Then why not do it?"

Id
"..."

Citan
"Shall I tell you why?
You do not have complete
control over Fei do you?
Your control of him is
incomplete.
To break those bonds would
require a tremendous amount
of mental energy.
Having used up your energy,
Fei would return again.
Basically, you would have
to leave the stage.
Obviously, the day you
would be able to return
is indeterminate.
Hence, you will not do it.
Am I mistaken?"

Id
"So you know me too well.
I don't have complete..."

Citan
"What is wrong, Id?"

Id
"You forced me on stage.
He's waking. Under normal
circumstances, I would've
been able to hold on.
But I can't. This is all
that woman's fault.
Her existence makes Fei
resistant."

Citan
"You mean Elly?"

Id
"That woman...the same.
Everyone. Must...
eliminate..."

Citan
"I do not understand.
I do not understand, Id."

Id
"You don't need to
understand.
But when the time comes,
just take it as it comes.
Reality and death..."

Id
"I'll eventually get to
you...Be seein' ya."
ou...Be seein' ya." (*???cut line here*)

Citan
"The emotional portion of
Fei's present personality
was sealed up by...
...his father through
some method...
And now with the cleared
foundation of Id's
personality... In computer
terms...
...it is like constructing
a mock personality on top
of the compatible portion
of the OS.
That is the reason Fei has
no memory of his past.
Those 10 or so years of
memories are under the
supervision of Id.
As long as Id does not
willingly hand over the
memories...
There is no way for Fei
to know since he did not
even exist before the
time Id was sealed up.
The present Fei's
personality is an
underdeveloped one which
was built upon within... 
...the 3 years of living in
Lahan, studying and
acquiring other people's
reactions.
Hence, he does not know how
to fully cope with sudden
or emotional situations.
Elly, you are the one who
has spent the most time
with Fei so I would assume
you would understand this.
Were there not times when
he would be psychologically
unstable?
For example, he would be
manicly depressive and then
have sudden fits of
rage..."

Elly
"...
Yes..."

Jessie
"Then his present
personality is but only a
temporary one?"

Citan
"That is not what I am
saying. The present Fei
is one single personality.
It is just that structure-
wise, his personality was
constructed on top of
Id's...
...hence placing Fei at a
lower hierarchy.
That is why when Id is
active, Fei has no
recollection of it."

Jessie
"Then that means he might
eventually be overtaken
by Id?"

Citan
"Yes, if it were only Id
and Fei. But that does not
seem to be the case.
Id only manifests when
Fei's mental energy is in
a weakened state.
It is a mystery in itself
that the lower level
personality of Fei...
...has any control over
the upper level
personality of Id.
It is obvious that there
exists a third personality.
Id calls this existence
the coward.
In my observation, this
coward may be the
fundamental personality
of Fei.
In other words, Id's
manifestation is not
controlled by Fei...
...but is controlled by
the personality known
as the coward."

Jessie
"...Then that means,
what?"

Citan
"At the same time Id 
resents this coward, he
also obviously fears it.
From a certain point of
view, this coward is the
one assisting in keeping
the present Fei in control.
I do not know the reason
why this third personality,
excuse me...
...Fei's fundamental
personality does not come
out...
If this one awakens, it
will become one with Id.
...In other words, there
is a possibility that the
complete original
personality...
...may be restored."

Jessie
"Is that for sure?"

Citan
"Probably. But I do not
know how to awaken it.
Before I had the
opportunity, Id disappeared
and he has been like that
since.
Basically, as long as
nothing happens to Fei that
would challenge his
existence...
...Fei can be himself.
But his surroundings do
not allow him that
opportunity.
It would be best for him
to live in a place that
is peaceful..."

Elder (*???add*)
That is Lacan...
No, the dark one.
Grahf's second advent!
We must restrain and seal
him up otherwise we don't
know what may occur!

Zephyr
"Cease this at once!
May we at least wait for
Wiseman to return before
we make any resolutions?"

Elder
Although a tactician, why
do you place so much
importance on him?
I have been silent all this
time since Khan's death,
since he was directly
recruited by the Queen.
However, I question why you
would use such a person
whose principles lack any
understanding of sacrifice?

Zephyr
"Well, that is..."

Elder
You must look at reality!
The existence of that
power!

Bart
"Hold on, hold on.
What's this Grahf's
second advent?"

Elder
The Day of the Collapse
was brought upon by Grahf.
Grahf manipulated Diabolos
into destroying this world.
And that power within Id is
far too similar to Grahf's.
We cannot allow such a
hazard to be set free.
We ought to immediately
freeze him in carbonite.
Otherwise, expect the
worst at any moment...

Elly
"No...!
But isn't the present
Fei the real Fei?
If that's the case,
then why..."

Elder
But he is still far too
dangerous! Think about it.
He single-handedly
annihilated the Solaris
capital!
We can't set him free!

Jessie
"Not only that.
In the past, there were
countless other cities
that were destroyed by Id.
I don't know their
intentions, but Grahf
and Krelian were always
involved somehow.
And one of those incidents
was Elru.
It was Dominia's homeland.
Solaris' purging of the
rebelling city of Elru was
done through the use of Id.
To test his capabilities.
As a result, not only was
Elru taken down, all the
Solaris units present
were wiped out..."

Bart
"He's responsible for
the Ygg's...and our..."

Rico
"So he was the one who
killed my subordinates
in the sewers..."

Elly
"What's wrong with you all?
Aren't we supposed to be
his friends!?"

Citan
"It appears everyone else
is in agreement... The
risks are just too great."

Elly
"Citan!?
No...
That is terrible!"

Zephyr
"..."

Elder
It's decided then.
He will be scheduled for
carbon freezing, tomorrow.
