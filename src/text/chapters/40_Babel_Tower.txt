Jessie
"What about the 'Ethos'?
They've completely
devastated themselves!
That mob just goes from
bad to worse!"

Citan
"Do you not think it is
about time you told your
son the truth, old friend?
You were not just
wandering around drinking
and picking fights, were
you?
I am sure he wants to
know what you have been
up to...
Is that right, Billy?"

Billy
"Yes, it would certainly
make me feel a lot better.
I now know my dad was
worried about me the whole
time, but I haven't worked
out my feelings yet..."

Jessie
"What do you mean?"

Billy
"Well I'm glad Prim can
speak now, but she only
calls out for her father...
But I am the one who has
been taking care of her
all this time...
What's wrong with her...?"

Citan
"Calm down, Billy...
I am sure she is just
being shy.
She will start calling out
for you soon. Why, my own
daughter does not even call
out her father's name!"

Citan
"So, old friend...
Why were you working
alone all that time?"

Jessie
"It couldn't be helped...
Anyway, I'll probably need
your help from here on..."

Jessie
"Okay, I'll tell you more.
Let's go to the gun room...
to get something to drink."

Jessie
"When I was in Solaris, I
found out about the secret
plan...
That was the 'Malakh' (M)
Plan.
And it was done under the
command of Krelian...
In order to proceed with
the plan, many Lambs were
gathered by the 'Ethos',
to become guinea pigs.
Or, should I say, to become
Reapers or -Wels-..."

Jessie
"Since I was disgusted with
Solaris' methods, I decided
to investigate it further.
I found out that the main
scientist central to the M
Plan moved the true facts
about it into a test-Gear.
Then he let that test-Gear
escape with his daughter,
so that the truth would
not be discovered...
And that, I'm afraid, was
the last information that
I was able to obtain..."

Jessie
"Because of what I found
out, I came down to the
surface world...
And this is where I hid,
along with my wife,
Racquel, and son Billy.
I've been looking for
that Gear and the girl
ever since."

Jessie
"Finally, I found out that
the scientist's daughter
and Gear may be in Shevat.
All very well, except now
I don't know how in blazes
to get there, or even how
to contact the place.
Well, Shevat is protected
by a strong barrier that
even Solaris can't do
anything about...
So I guess you can say
it can't be helped...
It's just my luck!"

Shevat Man
That girl's name
wouldn't happen
to be Maria...?

Billy
"Oh, are you two alright?
Shouldn't you get some
more rest...?"

Shevat Agent
"Yes, I can stand and
can even walk now...
Thank you."

Fei
"I'm alright, too."

Jessie
"Maria, eh...? Hmm...
If I remember right, her
father's name was Nikolai?"

Shevat Agent
"I don't know that much...
But I have heard rumors
about a girl and a Gear."

Jessie
"Hmm, it's got to be them.
So that huge Gear is in
Shevat then!"

Jessie
"So then... how can we get
to this Shevat? Is there a
way to contact the place?"

Shevat Agent 
"Unfortunately since I was
taken captive I have no way
of contacting them either."

Jessie
I see...

Shevat Agent
!!

Shevat Agent
"There just may be a way...!
Originally, Shevat was
situated on top of
Babel Tower.
They say there is a
communication facility to
contact Shevat's native
country on top of the tower. 
If only it still exists..."

Citan
"Hmm...
There is a good
possibility the
facility may have
been destroyed...
Especially when you
consider the fact
that the tower was
sealed by the 'Ethos'."

Jessie
"You're being
pessimistic again..."

Citan
"I am just being
realistic."

Jessie
...

Bart
"I guess we have no choice
but try and go there.
As long as the gate exists,
we can't escape from
Solaris' influence anyway.
In other words, even if we
recover Aveh from Shakhan,
it wouldn't immediatley be
a happy ending."

————————————————————————————
-ALT- Billy

Billy
"I think we have no
choice but to try
and go there...
Either way, as long
as the gate exists we
can't escape from the
shadow of Solaris."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Their 'secret plan' 
bothers me, too...
The real secret is that
they are using humans
gathered from earth..."

Fei
"But I don't quite get this
secret plan and the 'Ethos'
involvement and so on...
What in the hell does
Solaris think us surface
dwelling humans are!?"

Fei
"...Sorry.
I totally forgot that it
was your country..."

Elly
"What my country's doing...
has nothing to do with me.
I myself thought something
was wrong there, and that's
why I came here...
So, don't worry about me.

Fei
"We've got nothing to lose,
so let's try to go there.
We need to find the truth
about those documents found
in the 'Ethos' H.Q. and
what Billy's father said.
And I must go to Shevat
too for my own personal
reasons anyway."

Fei
"No time like the present,
huh!? Let's go to Babel
Tower right away!"

You're back...?
Well, find
anything?

Krelian
"Yes.
I have obtained a colony
of nanomachines."

Blue 1???
How unsound.

Blue 3???
In any case, is the
M Project proceeding as
planned? We need superior
bodies and servants.

Red 2???
We've spent far too
much time here.
We can't afford to mistake 
the ultimate destination 
of this new civilization.

Red 3???
They exist because
of their 'mother'.

Krelian
"Hmm.
You've betrayed your
'mother', your 'creator',
just to sustain your own
egos. You have no right to
speak so...

Red 1???
That was...foolish,
that was the past.
When we were trapped in
that cursed flesh...
But now, it is different.

Krelian
"I'll take no orders from
you.
You have lost that flesh
long ago, and now reside
in the SOL-9000 as data.
Did you forget who revived
you in there?
What may be an eternity
to man is but a moment to
a god.
I have no need for
hesitation."

They allowed contact

There is an 'Anima Relic'
in Shevat...
...We can't afford to have
them align before
preparations are complete.

Blue 2 (og blue 1???)
It's meaningless if it
is not compatible with
our type.

Blue 3???
You want to bury
all of Shevat?

Red 1???
What of the 'Animus'?

Red 3???
There are others.
We must respond
severely so this
doesn't happen again.

Blue 4???
What about the Shevat
gate? As long as it is
there, we can't get in.

Blue 3???
Easy. We just use
Achtzehn's gravity
cannon to compensate
for the time-space warp.

Red 1???
Achtzehn?
Is it operational?

Blue 3???
Re-education is complete.
It is ready. 
The airborne squad is
already assembled.

Red 4???
Any side effects?

Red 2???
The regulated 71st
Airborne should have no
problems.

Red 3???
Well then, I look
forward to this.
