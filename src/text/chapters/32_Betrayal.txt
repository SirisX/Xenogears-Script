Betrayal - Thames Bridge - 1234
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Where's Elly?"

Hans
"She's seeing to the
Gear. She will be
along any time now."

Bart
"You mean...
she was able to escape?"

Captain
"Well it's good for you.
Right, Fei?"

Fei
"Ah, yeah."

Fei
"Elly, are you okay?"

Elly
"...Yeah."

Bart
"..."

Elly
"What's that submarine?"

Fei
"Oh, you mean the
Yggdrasil?
It took a bad bashing,
so now it's here, at
Thames, for repairs."

Elly
"I see...
Can I rest for a 
while?
...I'm exhausted."

Fei
"That's a good idea."

Bart
"Fei, it's my ship."

Captain
"Oi, oi.
She said she's tired.
Let her rest."

Elly
"Well, I'm going."

Bart
"...
I don't like this."

Fei
"Bart you're still..."

Bart
"It's not like that.
She won't backstab us.
I was raised around thugs
and charlatans. I can
tell just by looking
in her eyes."

Fei
"Then you accept Elly..."

Bart
"That's why I can't.
She may be okay with it.
But what about her family
back home? Do you think
she can live with that?
Can she do that? Just get
rid of her family?
She has to decide.
She...Elly is probably
worrying about that.
We can't involve people
who have attachments."

Fei
"Bart..."

Bart
"Hmph, well do whatever
you want."

————————————————————————————

Captain
"Everything's okay.
The lady came back
unharmed."

Sigurd
"Young master, where did
you go while we were so
busy...?
An international goodwill
visit with the Thames?
Well, whatever...
Now about those supplies
for the submarine..."

Bart
"Oh, that?
Let me see...order an
additional 16 torpedoes!"

Sigurd
"Yes, sir."

Yggdrasil Crew Quarters - 1184
————————————————————————————

Man
Elly is resting in the
medical room across from
here. I bet she can't
sleep in a shabby place
like this.

Pirate
Elly was acting strangely.
Did she have a fight...?
Being young is great.
I used to be like that
when I was your age.

Yggdrasil Margie's Room - 1208
————————————————————————————

Chu-Chu
"This place isn't
chu familiar.
But it doesn't matter
because I didn't know
muchu about Aveh in
the first place chu."

Margie
"I was the only one who
escaped Shakhan's grip by
fleeing Nisan with Bart...
I wonder if the sisters
are all right...
The young master will help
them too, won't he?"

Margie
"Even though it was the
sect's wish, it still left
a bitter feeling..."

Yggdrasil Medical Bay - 1204

Nurse
Elly was lying down 
till a minute ago...

Now that you mention it,
I wonder where she went.

Sick Man
There was something
wrong with Elly.

Soldier 1
Phew! I no longer have
to listen to the roars
of the old man any more.

Soldier 2
The engine's restoration
is finally finished.
Why don't you go down
the stairs to take a look
at our beautiful engine.

Maison
"Y...young master!
I heard all about it.
International amity
with the Thames!?
Indeed..."

(...Sob...sob...
This old man's efforts
weren't all wasted!)

eyes of a prisoner."

Yggdrasil Engine Room - 1178

Chief Engineer
Whaaat's up? Martle? Eh?
Huh?

Hey, Miss.
I heard you got caught.
Are you okay?

Easy, Martle!
It's just the Solarian
girl. You don't need
to bark!

Elly
"It's an animal, so
it can't help it.
By the way, the first
mate wants to see you."

Chief Engineer
...Oh?
Oh, I see.
Sorry.

Fei
"Elly!!"

Elly
"...
Fei...?"

Fei
"Elly!!"

Bart
"I knew it all along...
This moll's a mole!"

Bart
"Damn it! What the hell
did she do!? What am I
gonna do!!"

Fei
"Doc!
What is this..."

Citan
"Wait! Do not worry about
her. Stopping this is our
priority."

Citan
"There...
How is this..."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"...She was given some
strong hypnosis."

Fei
"Hypnosis...?"

Citan
"It is a special hypnotism
that makes a person behave
in a pre-programmed way.
A special condition serves
as a switch to act...but
until then no strange
behavior can be detected.
She looked strange when
coming out of the medical
room, so I followed her."

Bart
"...Citan, if you thought
it was suspicious, you
shoulda stopped her."

Citan
"Well, if you forcibly
stop the behavior while
imprinting,
occasionally
it destroys the mind...
But it is true that I
reacted a little late..."

Chief Engineer
Wha, what's going on?
Young master,
have you done it again?

Citan
"It may take a while to
fix it..."

Chief Engineer
Did she do this...
Hypnosis?
...That's pretty
damned underhanded
even for Solaris!

Bart
"It broke again just after
getting restored. What am
I gonna do..."

Citan
"Anyhow, we will take her
to the medical room first.
Fei, go to the room when
you are done here. No need
to worry. The hypnotist
must have been a good one.
There are no mental scars."

Maison
"Miss Elly...
What kind of spell
was used on her?"

————————————————————————————
Yggdrasil Medical Bay - 1204
————————————————————————————

Citan
"She was able to
get up just now."

Elly
"I, I...
How in the world
did I get here?"

Fei
"Elly..."

Sigurd
"Young master, the radar
has picked up a huge Gear!
It's headed right for us!"

Bart
"What!?
Them again!?"

Sigurd
"That shape looks like...!"

Bart
"Alright! I owe so much to
the Thames. I can't let it
turn into a battle field.
Launch the Yggdrasil
immediately!
We'll go out in our
Gears!"

Sigurd
Yes, sir!!

Bart
"Fei, Citan,
I'm counting on you!"

Elly
Wait!!

Citan
"Elly should rest here.
We will..."

Elly
"Wait!!
Because I came here this
all happened...
This is my responsibility!
So...
So let me go too!"

Fei
Elly...?

Bart
"What the hell are
you talking about!
Don't you remember
what you just did...!?"

Citan
Young one!

Citan
"Elly, our trust in you
depends on this battle.
For your honor, you
should fight!"

Bart
"But Citan!
I...!"

Citan
"Young one,
please trust
Elly this time."

Citan
"Elly, if you try anything
suspicious, I will be the
one to shoot you.
Is that clear?"

Elly
Yes.

Citan
"Is that okay with you,
young one?"

Bart
"...
Alright. Fei, Elly,
let's go!!"

Elly
Yes!

Fei
Yeah!!
