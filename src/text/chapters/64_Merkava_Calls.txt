Fei
"Ramsus!?"

Krelian
"Hmph...
It's just you..."

Miang
"What are you doing
here, Kahr?"

Ramsus
"What about me...?
My existence...
What was its purpose?"

Miang
"There was only one purpose
to your existence...
To eliminate Emperor Cain.
Cain's will had become too
much like that of humans'.
He was too concerned about
them.
He had forgotten his
mission to revive god.
That is why you were
created.
You were only made
to remove our main
hindrance...Cain.
But, as the original
living being, Cain
had absolute power.
To make you turn on
Cain, it was necessary
to focus your mind on
a single point.
However, being an
artificial life form, you
were mentally unstable.
That is why...we used
Fei's existence.
Resentment... That is the
source of your strength.
And you have excelled
superbly at fulfilling
our expectations of you.
But...we no longer have
any more use for you.
Haven't you realized that
yet?
You're a piece of trash.
And being the reject that
you are, why don't you just
leave? Hah hah hah."

Ramsus
"I... I...
What was I born for?
What was I living for?"

Krelian
"A pathetic excuse for a
life.
Why, you aren't even human!
Kahaha...
Hah hahaha...!"

Miang
"Now, what to do with the
lot of you...
Well, I can't just kill
you all...seeing as you
have served me so well.
So, as a reward, I'll allow
you to be sacrificed too...
To be assimilated into Deus
along with this girl..."

Miang
"Guhh...!?"

Fei
"Ramsus!!"

Miang
"Good...
This is how I wanted it,
Kahr...
I am fated so as not to
be able to kill myself...
Now...all...my...wishes
have...come...true.
Thanks...to...you...!"

Ramsus
"...
Miang..."

Ramsus
"Uh, uhaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"

Bart
"Fei, sorry we're late.
Our Omnigears broke down.
Anyway, let's hurry up
and save Elly!"

Rico
"Too bad we missed the
action. Our Omnigears
gave out on the way here.
Anyways...
Let's hurry up and save
Elly!"

Citan
"Forgive us for being late.
My Omnigear gave out on the
way in here.
Well, anyway, let us hurry
and save Elly!"

Billy
"I am sorry!
My Omnigear broke
down on the way here.
Now, we better help
Elly down before it's
too late!"

Chu-Chu
"Didn't mean chu make you
wait. Now let's go take
down the big cheese.
But first, we have chu
save Elly!"

Fei
"Yes, I know!"

Fei
"Hang in there, Elly!
I'm letting you down now."

Fei
"Ghaah!"

Citan
"Fei!
Now you hang
in there!"

Billy
"Sh, she took my gun...!?"

Bart
"W, why did
you do that,
Elly...?"

Citan
"Elly!?
What happened to you!?
How could you!?"

Bart
"Don't tell me
she's been...
brainwashed!?"

Krelian
"It has nothing to do
with brainwashing..."

Krelian
"The majority of my
body is comprised of
a nanomahine colony.
Not only for longevity
...but also to unify
with the 'mother'...
So don't be surprised.
This much damage can
be recovered rather
quickly."

Citan
"Unify with
the mother...?"

Krelian
"That girl...Elhaym,
is our 'mother'."

Elly
"Yes.
I am the mother of
all humans..."

Fei
"Elly...!?"

Bart
"What are you babbling
on about!?
Snap out of it, Elly!!"

Elly
"You're as dense as
usual... But, I don't
blame you...
So be it.
I will explain to
you all about it."

Elly
"This Deus, the one you call
god, is an 'inter-planetary
invasion weapon system' that
was built in ancient times by
humans from another planet.
It was created as an automatic
weapon which could act upon
its own will to take control
of a targeted planet. But you
should've known this much from
looking at the Razael records.
Anyway, during a test run,
Deus became uncontrollable.
It released its power and
annihilated a whole planet.
The creators of 'Deus' found
its immeasurable power to be
too much of a threat and hence
forcibly shut it down.
In order to analyze the cause
of the problem, its core was
dismantled and placed on an
inter-planetary emigrant
passenger ship to be
transported to another planet.
Becoming aware of this, the
dissasembled Deus resisted.
It tried to  take over the
passenger ship that was
transporting it.
However, as a last line of
defense against the escape
of Deus, its creators,
unexpectedly destroyed the
whole ship, sending it
crashing to this planet.
Deus knew that it would not
be able to get away from the
explosion or the imminent
impact and so it detached its
core from the 'Zohar' power
reactor."

Fei
"Zo...har...?"

Elly
"Yes, 'Zohar'...
It is what drives all of
the Gears on this planet.
It is the master generator
that transmits its energy
to the slave generators
in our Gears.
It is also the source of
all the Ether power that
the inhabitants of this
planet utilize.
By utilizing the energy
displacements caused by
actualizing potential
future phenomenon...
...this 'Zohar Modifier'
has the ability to produce
infinite amounts of
energy."

Bart
"The source of all
our Ether power!?"

Citan
"Are you saying all our
energy comes from that one
power reactor or engine?"

Elly
"Yes, but there is more...
The core that was detached 
from Zohar, the 'Biological
Computer Kadomony' crashed
onto this primitive planet.
It activated -Persona-,
its life support plant,
that can generate organic
material.
Using this it prepared for
itself a genetic-based
system for the day when
Deus would be resurrected.
Thus, the first humans were
created from there...
Emperor Cain and the elders
of the Gazel Ministry."

Rico
"Are you saying the Emperor
and them Gazel geezers were
people born from Deus!?"

Elly
"Do you know why the Gazel
Ministry desired the Anima
Relics and your bodies?
Well, here's the reason...
Before becoming human, the
bodies of the Ministry were
once part of the organic
elements in the core circuit
that made up 'Deus'.
There were two types of
organic elements.
The female type was called
'Anima', while the male
type was called 'Animus'.
They were also created with
the added ability to become
mobile weapons by merging
with machinery that was
suited for use as terminal
interface weapons for Deus.
In other words, those
Omnigears you were using
were one form of such
weapons.
The Ministry, which were
Animus, were to become one
again with their separated
Anima at the time of the
resurrection of god...
But, in a war 500 years ago,
they all lost their physical
bodies.
It was then that they
decided to extract their own
genetic factor from certain
individuals of their human
descendants who carried the
appropriate sets of D.N.A..
All so each of them could
become one with their
respective Anima again."

Maria
"Descendants!?"

Bart
"Then we're all...!?"

Elly
"Yes, you humans are all
descendants of Cain and
the Gazel Ministry...
They were born from the
-Persona-, gave birth,
and propagated.
They followed their
inbuilt program to
someday resurrect the
heavily damaged Deus."

Citan
"All the people in the
world were created solely
to resurrect Deus!?"

Elly
"Yes.
But it wasn't just to
restore its old body.
More than half of Deus is
constructed of biological
parts. Do you remember
those mutated humans?
Those are all people who
were destined to become
replacement parts for
Deus."

Billy
"We humans are...
parts for god..."

Elly
"Yes, almost all the
people are destined to
become parts for Deus.
But you people gathered
here are all different.
You could say...you
escaped that destiny by
existing through multiple
generations...
In actuality, there wasn't
enough parts for Deus...
But, Krelian compensated
for what was lacking.
The reduction in the number
of parts, was due to humans
living through multiple
generations...
But that deficiency in the
human factor, was made up
for by the nanomachines
created by Krelian.
Not only that, but his
nanomachines added
additional functions.
Deus has thus evolved into
the perfect weapon.

Fei
"Elly...
What has happened...?
Why...do you know
all...that...?"

Elly
"I am Miang. The keeper of
time. The representative of
our god -Deus-.
I was born to guide the
people toward the path of
the resurrection of Deus."

Bart
"That's ridiculous!
Miang was just..."

Elly
"You're limited in your
ability to understand...
Miang's factor exists
within all women.
The one who trascends the
generations, the caretaker
of humans.
When the previous one dies,
somewhere another Miang is
awakened.
It is programmed into all
womens' DNA to be that way.
Who inherits the duty is
just a matter of
probability, Fei.
That Miang over there and
I are the same existence. 
We are all parts of Deus...
All caretakers of humans."

Elly
"Let us end this
discussion now. 
Deus has awakened.
I am one of the parts
that composes Deus.
Hence, I must become
one with it."

Citan
"Elly!
Why did it have to be
you?
If Miang is a part for
Deus, why did it not
happen earlier...?"

Krelian
"It's still not enough
for her just to have
awakened.
Although she may be
Miang, she still isn't
the 'true Miang'."

Citan
"The 'true Miang'...?"

Elly
"Let's go, Krelian.
All that is left to do is
to vanquish this planet's
civilization and return
it to how it was.
Then I can complete my
unification with the
final fragment of Deus...
the 'Zohar Modifier'...
The power reactor that
fell upon this planet and
became our genesis, and
now, our apocalypse..."

Citan
"The eradication of
civilization!?
What is the purpose
of doing that!?"

Elly
"Who knows...?
The creations of god will
someday be a hindrance.
That is why they must be
eliminated.
I am just programmed to
act in this way..."

Krelian
"Come...
It is time for
the awakening of
the true 'mother'."

Fei
"Please...
wait...
Elly...!"

Elly
"Farewell...Fei.
May you have a peaceful
'awakening'..."
