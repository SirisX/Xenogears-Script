Associate
"Kaiser, we have some news."

Sigmund
"Yes."

Associate
"We investigated the cause
of the recent explosion at
the southern Aveh border.
Our data showed a large
amount of radiation was
released at the epicenter.
It was probably caused by
an overload of a battleship
class slave generator.
The cause of this is still
unknown.
The shockwaves from that
explosion took out two
thirds of the Aveh and 
Gebler forces combined.
Now, Aveh is in the process
of regrouping their reserve
units, but that should take
at least several days."

Associate
"Concerning your order,
the scouts have arrived at
the area you requested..."

Sigmund
"Found it, eh...?"

Associate
"Yes, sir."

Sigmund
"I see."

Associate
"We know the Gear found was
stolen from the 11th base
by the Gebler unit in Aveh.
And in the investigation of
the machine, we also caught
the unconscious pilot.
The seized Gear has been
transported to the capital.
From the circumstances, we
believe information was
leaked to Aveh."

Sigmund
"How can you say that?"

Associate
"All the Gears except this
were destroyed at Lahan.
Judging from the ID signal,
this one wasn't with Aveh
but was part of a pirate
group."

Sigmund
"Pirates?
You mean the
young prince?"

Associate
"Yes, sir."

Sigmund
"Uh huh..."

Associate
"We're now analyzing the
combat data.
However, we've discovered
some black boxes which
are likely to delay the
analysis."

Sigmund
"Black boxes?"

Associate
"That Gear wasn't made by
us. The stock body was
brought in by 'them'."

Sigmund
"So that's it..."

Associate
"...Uh...Kaiser?"

Sigmund
"What?"

Associate
"Shouldn't we begin
an assault on Aveh?"

Sigmund
"Are you trying to
destroy Kislev?"

Associate
"Huh?"

Sigmund
"Indeed it would be easy
to take down Aveh.
But it would exhaust our
resources also."

Associate
"But we can't afford
to miss this chance..."

Sigmund
"Even if we beat Shakhan,
Solaris would only replace
him with another puppet.
What if we exhausted our
resources and found our-
selves under attack?
Anyway, we must still be
concerned with Nisan.
There is nothing to gain
by doing anything now.

Excuse me!

Sigmund
"It seems 'they'
have arrived..."

Sigmund
"Is that it?"

Masked Woman
"Yes. If you use that,
you can pass through
the barrier.
You will be free to
go where and when you
please."

Sigmund
"That man...what was it?
Grahf? Is he around?"

Masked Woman
"He's rather busy now.
I was assigned to be
his representative."

Sigmund
"I will ask you this
once. Why do you help us?
Who are you people?"

Masked Woman
"I've told you before.
I simply wish to observe
what is in store for the
world.
There are so many things
you people must know.
I am merely your guide.
I cannot directly assist
you. How you use it is
entirely up to you."

Sigmund
"So you're telling me
you do not require any
recompense?"

Masked Woman
"Let me see...
Well then, how
about this...?"

Masked Woman
"Well, I must go..."

Sigmund
"...But, what a strange
thing to ask for."

Associate
"What did she say?"

Sigmund
"They want me to transfer
that Gear we captured and
its pilot to D Block..."

Associate
"D Block?
I wonder why?"

Sigmund
"I don't know either.
...But, we still owe them
a favor. We just can't
deny them. So see to it!"

Associate
"Yes, sir..."

Fei running in the void - 1092
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Hah, hah, hah..."

...Where...am...I...?

You shouldn't be here.

————————————————————————————
Kislev Capital - D Block Housing - 1032
————————————————————————————

Fei
"...Wh, where am I?"

Good, you've finally woken up!
...You have been unconscious
for four days, so I had begun
to fear the worst.

Fei
"...Who are you?
And where am I?
How did I get here...?"

Fei
"Ah,
uuuugh...!"

You've only just gained
consciousness, so don't
push yourself too much!
I am a doctor.
You are in Nortune, the
Imperial capital of Kislev.
This is the detention area
for criminals...commonly 
known as 'D block'.

Fei
"Detention area for...
...criminals?"

Doctor
"You are now in a living 
quarters for prisoners in
D block...
Judging by the way you were
brought here under the heavy
guard of the Kislev army, you
are no ordinary criminal...!"

Doctor
"Huh!?"

Suzarn
"Oh look, what good timing!
Prince Charming has woke up!
This may be sudden, but you
have to come along with us!"

Doctor 
"Not the 'Baptismal Ceremony'!?
This patient has only just awoke!
It is unthinkable that you would
try and suddenly carry out your 
'Baptismal Ceremony' on him!!!"

Vargas
"Come off it! Just a sec!
That guy's been thrown in 
'ere as a crim, ain't 'e?
You should be thanking
us for 'aving the kind and
compassionate 'eart to let
'im rest up a few days!"

Heinrich
"Yeah, that's right! As long
as he's come here as a crim, 
he's gotta follow the rules!"

Leonardo
"...That's the way it is! 
So without further ado,
we'll borrow him for a 
little while.
Don't worry, we will return 
him to you straight away!
Once we're through with 
him, that is!"

Suzarn
"You don't have a choice in
this! If you oppose us, the
fair doctor will cop it too!"

Fei
"...
...Okay.
I'll do what you want!"

Doctor
"I am so sorry! I can't
go against the Battlers!
Please forgive me..."

Suzarn
"Oh, what a sensible lad!
That saves us a bit of
trouble.
Anyway, come along now,
the 'Champ' is waiting!
And don't worry! We'll
let you return here soon."

Suzarn
"Hurry up then..."

Suzarn
"Fo-rwa-rd ma-rch!"

Kislev - Champ's Room - 1042
————————————————————————————

Suzarn
"Champ, we've brought
him to you."

A man called 'Champ'
"Thanks Suzarn.
Hmmm, so you're the
new inmate...
We don't know or care what
you did to get put in here,
but welcome to D Block...
So what name do you go by?"

Fei
"...I am Fei Fong Wong.
And what's your name?
I know it's not really
'Champ'?
I at least have the right
to know that much..."

Suzarn
"Why you...!? 
How insolent!!"

Champ
"Calm down Suzarn.
I don't mind...
The name's Rico."

Rico
"Kid...
It's good to have guts...
if it's the real thing...
We know it's a bit sudden,
but we need to see how
strong you really are..."

Rico
"Heinrich!"

Rico
"Vargas!"

Rico
"Leonardo!"

Rico
"Suzarn!"

Rico
"Let's begin his 'Baptism'!
Take him outside!"

————————————————————————————
Kislev Capital - Alleyway - 1004
————————————————————————————

Rico
"Kid, you're up front."

Rico
"Now, I think you've got
the idea, but I'll tell
you anyway...
All the criminals sent here
are each given a rank.
Deciding what rank you are
is easy...
You get your rank by
fighting these four
Battlers."

Rico
"Relax, the fights are
one on one.
By now you should've
realized...
Results are everything!
If you can defeat these
four Battlers, you'll be
promised a certain amount
of freedom..."

Rico
"Then, let the fights
begin..."

Rico
"That's what I'd like to
say...but even we have
some compassion.
We'll give you some time...
Even though it's one on
one, you still have to
fight all four.
You should get prepared
for the battle.
And one more thing...
Don't even think about
trying to get away from
here... After all,
that's an impossibility."

Suzarn
"Hey, are you ready?"
    Hang on
    Let's rock
	
————————————————————————————

Suzarn
"...Hurry up.
Aside from myself, the
rest of the gang doesn't
have much patience."

————————————————————————————

Suzarn
"...Champ.
He's ready...for his
'Baptismal Ceremony'."

Rico
"Hmph, then let it
begin..."

Rico
"Your first opponent
will be Leonardo."

————————————————————————————
Ω Battle - Fei vs Leonardo
————————————————————————————
???

Leonardo
"Hunh! No no!! You ain't
got the basics, the
basics."

Rico
"That wasn't even a
match...
Your rank is D!!"

————————————————————————————

Leonardo
"To have lost to
someone who's just
recovered...Sadness."

Rico
"Hmph.
How's the next one?"

————————————————————————————
Ω Battle - Fei vs Heinrich
————————————————————————————

Heinrich
"Hahaha. We'll talk again
when you can beat me."

Rico
"Is that all...?
Your rank is C!!"

————————————————————————————

Heinrich
"Guh, uuhh... How could
I have..."

Rico
"Hmmm, entertaining.
How's the next one?"

————————————————————————————
Ω Battle - Fei vs Vargas
————————————————————————————

Vargas
"Heinrich and Leonardo
are pitiful to have lost
to the likes of 'im..."

Rico
"That's about right...
Your rank is C!!"

————————————————————————————

Vargas
"Hah! I'll get you
for this someday."

Rico
"Not bad. No one's
defeated Vargas since
Suzarn...
Now for the last one!
You think you can win?"

————————————————————————————
Ω Battle - Fei vs Suzarn
————————————————————————————
???

Suzarn
"Although he was able to
defeat the other three...
He was no match for me."

Rico
"Too bad...
Your rank is B!!"

Suzarn
"Champ, what shall
we do with him?"

Rico
"Leave him.
Someone'll find him."

Rico
"...Let's go."

————————————————————————————

Suzarn
"R...ridiculous... Even
I lost to you..."

Rico
"You've defeated all 4...
Hah, this is an
unexpected outcome.
Let me give you the
special treatment. I,
myself, will be your
final opponent."

Fei
"Enough! There's no
purpose in doing this!
I have nothing to do
with you!"

Rico
"No need for a reason.
This is the D Block
tradition! We must
determine the pecking
order."

Rico
"Get ready!"

————————————————————————————
Ω Boss Fight - Fei vs Rico - file55
————————————————————————————

Rico
"Is that all you can do?
What? Don't you want to
fight!?"

Fei
"Guh....
gah..."

Rico
"What's wrong? If you
don't resist, I'll end
up breakin' yer neck!"

Fei
"N..., no..."

Rico
"Hm? What's that?
I can't hear you!"

Fei
"No... I... 
won't... 
fight!"

Rico
"Hmph. Well then,
this is the end!"

Fei
"Guh... uh,
uh..."

...Outta the way!

Rico
"What!?"

Fei
"... I... I..."

Rico
"Hah hah hah.
That's more like it...
You're quite good.
You're the first one to
ever injure me.
Now I don't have to
hold back.
I'm looking forward to
this!"

————————————————————————————
Kislev Capital - Alleyway - 1004

Rico
"...A bit tough.
Well, a win is a win. 
Your rank is A."

Fei
"..."

Rico
"...Didn't you hear?
Take him back to
his quarters."

Rico
"...And don't forget that
one thing..."

Kislev Capital - D Block Housing - 1032
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Uuugh... ?
Where am I this time?"

Doctor
"...You're in the same place,
just in a different room!
You've had a rough day, heh?"

Fei
"Ah! ...Oh it's you?
It looks like I needed your
assistance again, huh...?"

Doctor
"Yes, but don't worry. I
don't mind - it's my job!
Anyway, how do you feel?"

Fei
"Hm? Aaah...
I'm in a bit of pain, but
nothing I can't cope with...
Lately I've been getting
used to this kind of thing.
Aah...!
The last thing I remember 
was those guys speaking of 
what 'rank' they think I am
worthy of."

Doctor
"Oh,
I think I better tell
you about that..."

Fei
"What? 
You know what rank I am?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"You're quite strong, aren't
you!? To defeat four people
in your condition...it's no 
wonder they gave you rank A!
But to go up against
the Champ...? 
It's amazing that you 
came back alive at all!"

Fei
"The fight was meaningless.
I had no reason to ...
I didn't want to fight..."

Doctor
"...What happened?
You look a bit pale."

Fei
"It's nothing. Don't worry.
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"Oh that? 
It's a bomb...
The moment you leave the 
vicinity of the Imperial 
capital, that collar goes
'BOOM'!
Too bad, but while
you have that on, you 
will never be able to 
escape from Nortune.
Apart from the civilians
of D Block and a select
few Battlers, everybody
has to wear them..."

Doctor
"...Here in D Block, 
that is the only chain 
that binds the prisoners."

Fei
"Huh, a bomb? So no matter
how much I struggle, I'll 
never escape from here."

Doctor
"Anyway, you should try and
get some rest today.
You'll have to get used to 
life in this town soon too."

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"I was surprised! Your rank is
B! They say you defeated three
people, and in your condition!"

Fei
"Yeah, I beat three of them.
But I ran out of energy
when I came to the fourth."

Doctor
"But that was incredible!
It makes me wonder how you 
would have gone if you had 
recovered fully beforehand."

Fei
"Hmm, I wonder too...
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"I think you were ranked C.
I doubt they would give you
anything higher if you only 
beat one or two people."

Fei
"...C Rank?
Huh, that would be 
about right for me."

Doctor
"Don't put yourself down.
You'll never survive here
if you have that attitude!"

Fei
"...Survive here? ...Huh?
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"I believe you were rank C.
But in your condition, you
did well just to beat one
opponent!"

Fei
"...Rank C?
Can I ask you a question?
Is rank that important?"

Doctor
"Most think that stronger 
is better, but...
well...
It allows you to rise above
living as a normal citizen.
If that's important to you 
then rank is important too!"

Fei
"I see...!
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"...You're rank D.
But that's understandable
considering your condition.
The very idea of 'Baptism'
is absurd to begin with!"

Fei
"...You mean...
I'm the lowest rank?"

Doctor
"To put it bluntly, yes!"

Fei
"Hmm...
...By the way, what's this 
thing around my neck?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
You should go and thank
Hammer.
He's the one that carried
you here from that back
alley where you collapsed!
Hammer's the local 
'supplier' of things 
and information.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first!"

Doctor
"Life here is tough, but
first it might be better
if you meet with Hammer!
Hammer is a 'provider' of
things and information.
He might appear strange but
he is good on the inside.
He's probably hanging out
at the bar, so it might be
best to check there first.
I'm sure he'll be of help!"

Man
There's talk that recently
the Champ himself conducted
a 'Baptismal Ceremony'.
I don't know whether it's 
true, but I feel for which
ever prisoner received it!

Hmm...but then again...
it might have been Suzarn.
Or, hold on, was it Vargas?

Battler 1
I'm a Battler in training,
with Prisoner Rank C!
Looky here, today's menu is
...wooh! ...'Stamina Uppen'!
Whahow! If I eat this up,
I'll increase my stamina 
and before you know it 
I'll be a Battle Master!
...I hope that happens!

Prisoner Woman
Our food is famous throughout
the Imperial capital!
Especially our dishes cooked
according to Ether theory,
like 'Boosta Limit' and
'HeavyWeighter'...
We provide according to rank
A or B, so you can only have
one or the other.
And it differs
with the individual,
but they are said to bring 
about remarkable effects!

Battler 2
...Soon they will start the
Battling Imperial Games that
will be watched by the Kaiser
himself... Right then's...

Yeah...errh...
right then's our chance! 
We'll use a Gear...and make
it look like an accident...

!?

What's with you!? Get lost!!

Battler 3
Today's earnings weren't so
great...
Boy I wish there was a whole
nest of monsters somewhere,
then I'd have it made! Huh!

Battler 4
I'm glad you spoke to me!
See I'm nice to new inmates.
So ask anything you want to!
What's bothering you?
    Where's the 'supplier'?
    What's with the sewers?
    Nothing's bothering me!

...Supplier?
Oh, you mean Hammer!
He's probably at the bar.
You'll know him when you
see him!
Go out the east door, turn
right, and then keep going
straight ahead.
The place with the neon
sign is the bar!

————————————————————————————

Ahh, the 'Kislev Sewers'!
Why not see for yourself!
Go out the west door and
climb the ladder...
Then once you're on the roof,
the ladder you can see to
the northwest descends into
the 'Kislev Sewers'!

You'll know it by the guy
standing watch near the
entrance. That's his job!

————————————————————————————

If you get stuck, just ask me!

Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!
	
Large Man
This door is under repairs.
Sorry, but would you mind
using the door to the west.

It's not that difficult
a problem! We'll have it
fixed in a little while!

Battler 5
In this town, when you take
proof of extermination of
sewer monsters to 'B-Info.',
they will exchange it for G,
the currency of this world.
It'll pay to remember this!

Repairman
I don't have much strength,
but I know I won't lose to
anyone in the manual
dexterity department!
So I'm doing the perfect job
for me, fixing the roof.
It pays almost as well as
working the sewers!

Only the operations manager

"...Even so
that's the way it is!!"

Fei
"Jeez, you don't have
to get so mad.
I didn't know.
So hey, tell me something,
what is this?"

Gramps
"...Might as well.
It's the Observation
Tower."

Fei
"Observation Tower?
What are you watching?"

Gramps
"Hmph, you'll find out

Gramps

...It's coming! There!"

Fei
"Wow, that's amazing."

Gramps
"...Well,
I'm the operations manager.
But there's no one to
manage.
It's perfectly automated.
I'm only the operations
manager on paper."

Fei
"Perfect?
Is anything in the world
perfect...?"

Gramps
"...Hmph.
The only weakness is the
detection equipment...
If it detects a heat source
it'll shut the whole thing
down to prevent any
accidents..."

Gramps
"I've some advice for you,
youngster! Jumping from
this tower is illegal!!
Even if I know you you,
I'm gonna fine you!
Better not forget it!
I'm no pushover!"

Gramps
"Beyond those tracks over
there...
There's some special
equipment in the tunnel.
There was a group who tried
to escape and didn't know
that. That bomb collar
went BOOM! Yep, see ya..."

that bomb collar on, it's
impossible to escape!"

I guess it'd be useless 
to tell this to a
criminal... Now, please
leave.

Man
It's true that this

necessary to build it in
this prison block?

I'm finally an

riot. There were many
casualties...

————————————————————————————

Ricardo was one of the
many casualties...
He had a lot of friends
but most were lost in
that great riot.

It was said that the cause
of the riot was due to the
friction between the
'Ethos' and the Kaiser.

The only thing brought
about by war are wasted
lives that only act as
reparations for the
destruction. What is
there to gain in a world
wrought with
destruction...We, the
people, stand upon a long
history of conflict and
war...Is it but only an
illusionary world where
we may all embrace each
other and live in a world
of cooperation?

She's our block's Venus.
Don't you think so too?
And on top of that, she's

I wouldn't mind being beaten
up...only if it was by Latina!

Drunk Man
Tina... Latina... hic...
...Gimme anudder drink...

Soldier
You look like you're new
here so I'll give you
some special advice.
Around here, if you don't
work, you're not gonna
earn your day's keep.
'If you don't work, you
don't eat', is how it is!
That's where prisoners like
you come into things...
Your job is to clean up the
sewers. It's not like there
aren't any other jobs...
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong.
When I say cleaning I don't
mean you use a mop to polish
the floors, or whatever...
Here in D Block,
'cleaning' is what we
call exterminating all
the monsters that live
down in the sewers.
As long as you get rid of
those monsters down there,
you shouldn't have a problem
makin' a living around here.
The rest is up to you...

By the way, I'm no prisoner.
I'm a freelancing profiteer
you can find almost anywhere.
Even if you're not a prisoner,
you can always exchange items
for money here.

Fat Man 2
If you're sent here, you're
pretty much sentenced for life.
...I'll probably never be able
to set foot on my homeland
again...sigh...

"Oh, allow me to introduce

'Hammer - the Supplier'.
It's been a long time since
such a powerful criminal
has been sent to D Block!
Heh-heh, so that makes you
pretty famous in this town.
In other words, you're the
center of attention, bro!"

————————————————————————————

Beastoid man
"Oh, allow me to introduce
myself... They call me,

Actually, it's the second

were knocked out cold..."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"...Could you stop calling
me 'bro'? My name is Fei!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"...What's wrong with it?
It's not like I'm putting
you down.
What, would you prefer
me to call you 'sir'
or something?"

Fei
"...
Oh, do whatever you wish."

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"Then it's decided.
I'll continue to call
you bro from now on!
By the way, bro, I hear
you're really strong.
Not many get rank A, you
know! I'm pretty impressed!
...And what's more, bro,
you seem different from
the other prisoners."

Fei
"...Different, huh?
Well you don't look
so normal yourself!"

'Hammer - the Supplier'
"It's not meant to be an
insult... Just a feeling
I have. No deep meaning!
Oh, and if you have any
problems, talk to me!
Since I'm a supplier, I've
got all the connections!"

Hammer
"Bro, doesn't it seem like
there's something missing
here in D Block?
Something, or things, that
you could find elsewhere,
but can't find here?
Yeah, yeah?
Don't you think so, bro?"
    ...No, not really
    Come to think of it

Hammer
"Wha, what? No?
Not really? Hmm.
That's strange."

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"Yeah, what's missing are
item shops, oh, and don't
forget the weapon shops..."

Hammer
"Ya need anything, bro?"
    Hammer's items
    Hammer's accessories

Hammer
"It's too expensive
elsewhere! Yep.
You know it's gotta be
'Hammer's Ether Bag'!"

It serves as a giant prison.

Wandering Battler
I'm a wandering Battler. 
I came here to participate
in the Battling matches they
will be holding here soon.
It seems I got here a tad
bit too early!
Sooo, now what am I to do?

Amazoness 1
In 'Battling', men and women
are called different names.
Generally, males are called 
'Battlers', while females
are called 'Amazonesses'.

Amazoness 2
...The Champ's strength is 
incredible. If only someone
would defeat the Champ...
then I might have a chance.

Battler
...The Imperial capital's
Battling Committee members?
Hmm, don't see them here now.
There was a group of three
people who came earlier,
but they've left.

"You men are hopeless!
This is why I didn't want
to come with you two.
Huhmm, allow me to introduce
myself. I'm Rue Cohen from
the 'Imperial Battling
Committee' in B Block of
this, the Imperial capital."

Fei
"...Imperial Battling
Committee?
What do you want with me?"

Committee Member Rue
"...I'll cut to the point.
We want you to participate
in the Battling tournament."

Fei
"...Battling?"

Committee Member Rue
"It's a recreational sport,
where Gear fights against
Gear, or even Gear fights
against monster depending
on the program.
Currently, there are no
regulations for eligibility.
And we, the committee,
rarely interact with the
participants directly.
You should be honored.
You are in luck that your
little incident with the
'Champ' caught our
attention so soon.
...So how about it?
Better a Battler than 
a prisoner...
It's not a bad deal 
at all."

Fei
"...I'm sorry, but I
don't like Gears.
I have no interest in such
recreational tournaments.
And above all, I don't even
have a Gear, so even if I
wanted to participate, I
can't. You ask too much!"

Subordinate
"Indeed, we ask too much!"

Subordinate
"Indeed, we ask too much!"

You two keep quiet!!"

Subordinate
"Uh, sorry, Ms. Cohen!!"

Subordinate
"Uh, sorry, Ms. Cohen!!"

Committee Member Rue
"Hmm, forgive me...
But do not worry about
the latter problem.
The Gear you require
for the Battling will
be provided by the
committee.
...So, will you
participate then?"

Fei
"Don't make me repeat
myself.
I hate Gears and I'm
not interested in
that kind of stuff!"

Committee Member Rue
"If you won't change your
mind then you'll...
Well, you're still new here.
I'll give you more time.
Perhaps we may have been
too pushy... But please,
think about this offer
seriously. I'll be looking
forward to a favorable reply."

Committee Member Rue
"Well then, hope to talk
to you again...soon!"

Fei
"...Gears, huh?"

Fei
"Whoa!?"

Fei
"Ha, Hammer!?"

Hammer
"Why did you do that,
bro?"

Fei
"Wait, Hammer.
What are you 
talking about?"

Hammer
"I overheard it all with
my own ears! Why did you
reject their invitation?
It's truly a rare occasion
for the committee to
personally make contact!
It's still not too late!
Do it, bro. We can still
make it, right? You'll be
a Battler... A Battler!!"

Fei
"Oh, that...
If you overheard, you
should already know.
I don't like fighting.
And Gears, well...!
Moreover, there is no
reason for me to do it."

Hammer
"If you become a Battler,
you can leave the prison
and live in luxury!
Power is everything here!
The powerless...the weak
are just oppressed!!
So c'mon, give it a try!"

Fei
"...
...Is that all?"

Hammer
"Huh? 
What do you mean?"

Fei
"...Are you done?"

Hammer
"...Done?"

Fei
"You've said enough...
Now could you move
out of the way?
Hammer, sorry, but I doubt
my feelings will change...
Fighting and Gears, I hate
them both. So too bad!"

Hammer
"Oh, bro!
You shouldn't worry about
such little details!
If you just rely on me, the
forefront of information,
then you will know it all!
So about this doctor..."

Fei
"...About what doctor?"

Hammer
"What?
You didn't know bro?
The previous lady doctor got
transferred to look after
the civilian sector of town!
Makes you envious, huh!
So's we gets a new doctor to
look after D block. 
They say he just got here!"

Fei
"...The new doctor, eh?
So, what on earth has this
new doctor got to do with 
you, the great 'supplier'?"

Hammer
"What are you talking about
bro? Of course I have
everything to do with him!
If I become chums with him,
I can expand my connections
by establishing black market
medical treatment routes!"

Fei
"...So that's it, huh?
Oh, Hammer, what will
we ever do with you?"

Hammer
"Whatever bro, whatever.
Anyway, let's go say
hello to him, shall we?"

Fei
"Well, yeah, I suppose we
should at least say hello."

"Too bad he's not here,
huh Hammer!
Looks like you'll have to
forget about those black
market medical treatment
routes you were..."

!?

Hammer
"The sound of an opening
door! It seems that the new
doc was in the next room!"

Fei
"D, d, doc?
Citan?
What are you doing here!?"

Citan
"I monitored Kislev's
radio communications...
I heard them talking about
a Gear they recovered in
Kislev that fit the
description of Weltall.
They said they transported
it to their capital, so I
came here on the off chance
I might also find you here!"

Hammer
"Huh? You wouldn't by
any chance know this
doctor, would you bro?"

Citan
"So anyway, Fei,
have you taken
any action yet?"

Fei
"...Taken any action?
What do you mean by 
that, doc?"

Citan
"You cannot stay in here 
forever, can you?
Are you not going to
escape?"

Fei
"Escape?"

Citan
"Fei! You are not intending
to spend the rest of your
life here are you?
You do not mind breaking
your promise, then?"

Fei
"What promise...?"

Citan
"Oh my! How could you
forget such an important
thing as that?
You promised Bart that you
would protect Margie and
the people of Nisan if
anything happened to him!"

Fei
"Oh that? I did promise
that, didn't I...!?
But...has something
happened to Bart?"

Citan
"I am afraid to say so.
He fought bravely against
the enemy's new forces...
But it was in vain! 
The Yggdrasil was badly
damaged and sank to the
bottom of the sea of sand.
Just before the ship sank,
I jumped in an escape-pod
and jettisoned out of there
so that I was not engulfed.
Since then, I regret to say
I could find out nothing of
the others' whereabouts or
fates..."

Fei
"Who would have thought...
What was I doing...?"

Citan
"What in the heavens
happened, Fei?"

Fei
"Once again...
I lost all memory...
and all sense of time...
While I was fighting that
Vanderkaum guy, he, Grahf,
appeared... Then I realized
Bart and the crew's plight.
The other guys with me were
defeated by Vanderkaum and
his giant-sized Gear...
After that...
After that...it was like
Lahan village over again!
When I woke up, I was in
Nortune's prison block..."

Fei
"Doc, what happened
to the squadron at
the borderlands?
What is the meaning of my
being here and Weltall
having been recovered in
Kislev...?"

Citan
"...That squadron
was annihilated!
There was also wreckage
of a giant-sized Gear...
the likes of which I have
never seen before!"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Come on now Fei!
Nobody is pointing
their finger at you!
It might have been caused
by something else!"

Fei
"It's alright, doc.
Little by little I've been
coming to understand it."

Fei
"Just maybe...
No...most surely...
I've done it again..."

Citan
"Oh, Fei..."

Fei
"I'll keep my promise...
Otherwise I'd never be 
able to look Bart in the
face again...
Cause Bart and them are
alive somewhere...
I just know that they
are!"

Citan
"So that means..."

Fei
"I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to get out of here!
Will you help me out doc?"

Citan
"Of course.
It will be my pleasure!"

Hammer
"No, bro, I doubt it!
Any thought of leaving
here is just a dream!"

Citan
"Why do you say that?"

Hammer
"Cause of these things!
They're explosive collars!
As long as we are wearing 
these, we'll never be able
to set foot out of here!"

Citan
"Explosive collars...?
That is dangerous
of them, is it not!?
Allow me to have a 
little look at it, 
please."

Citan
"...Let me see...Hmmm...
Well, well...Ah, ha...
Ohhh...Humph..."

Citan
"We might just possibly be
able to do something about
these."

Hammer
"Re, really!? ...Even
mechanical engineers gave
up on these in despair!"

Fei
"Doc was always good at
tinkering with machines.
So I guess there's hope!"

Hammer
"I don't know, bro!
Let's leave them alone!
No matter how good he is...
One tiny mistake and it's
BOOM! BANG! Game Over, man!
Get Hammer's drift, bro!?"

Fei
"...It's alright.
I believe in doc!"

Citan
"...Well then, shall
we give it a try?"

Citan
"...Are you absolutely sure
you want to go through with
this, Fei?
Do you not want to think it
through first? Just to be
sure, I mean! Though you
can trust me...I hope!"

Fei
"So, let's..."
    Take a rest first!
    Do it now, doc!
    Forget about it!
	
Citan
"Yes, let us rest up a
little first. In the
meantime, think carefully
about it!"
	
————————————————————————————

Fei
"...Yeah, I'm ready to do
it now. We may as well get
it over with then, huh!"

————————————————————————————

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"Oh bro! Please don't!
No matter how you look at
it, it's too dangerous!"

Citan
"Well then, Fei,
have you made up 
your mind yet?"

Fei
"Yes, well, errh, let's..."
    Wait a bit longer!
    Do it now, doc!
    Not do this, doc!
	
————————————————————————————

Citan
"...Well then, when you
you are ready, let me know 
as soon as possible, OK!"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"...Yeah.
Ready when you are doc!
No turning back, now, huh!"

————————————————————————————

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Well then... You are
sure you want to 
go through with it so..."

Hammer
"...Oooh, broooo!"

Citan
"Well then...
let us give
it a go..."

...RATTLE! RATTLE!

Citan
"Mmm...This is...
harder than...
I thought!"

...CLATTER! CLATTER! ...CLANG!

CLANK!

Citan
"Ah!
oop... Oh-oh!"

Fei
"Doc! What was that sound?
...And...what's that
behind your back?"

Citan
"Huh? Oh, err...
It is nothing, Fei.
Hahaha, nothing at all!"

Hammer
"Tha, tha, that part is...
the explosive collar's
safety device, isn't it!?"

Citan
"...S, sorry.
I did what I..."

Fei
"It's alright, doc.
It doesn't matter if you
take off one or two parts...
We are going to take the
whole thing off anyway!"

Citan
"...Err, well Fei...
What I just removed was 
the bomb's safety device..."

Fei
"Safety device...?
What does it do?"

Hammer
"Well bro...put simply, a
safety device is what stops
a bomb from exploding.
When you remove a safety
device from a bomb...
it means the bomb could
explode at any time!"

Fei
"..."

Fei
"This is bad!?
Hurry up and get this
thing off of me doc!"

Citan
"Now that it has no
safety device, if I mess up
while tampering with it...
then it is the end of us!
There is nothing more 
that I can do, Fei!
...I am so sorry!"

Citan
"It seems that these bombs
will not explode unless
given a very strong shock.
They are delicate when you
mess inside them, but they
are extremely good at
'shock absorption'...
...as you can tell from the
fact that even competitors
wear them in the Battling
Tournaments."

Fei
"But, no matter how shock
absorbant it is, it's still
dangerous in this state!?"

Citan
"That is true...
If only there was
something else we
could do besides
risky tinkering!"

Hammer
"Excuse me, doctor, but...
would you mind giving 
me that safety device?
It would fetch a fair price
if sold to a collector.
Of course I'd be willing
to pay you for it!"

Citan
"...This thing? 
Well I do not mind.
What do you think Fei?"

Fei
"Well it's of no value to
us to keep it now, is it?
...He can have it, doc!"

Citan
"Well then, 
here you go..."

Hammer
"Hee-hee. Thank you, man!
Take this as payment..."

Received 4000G!

Citan
"...But, we are still left
with the same problem.
If only there was a better
way of getting rid of that
explosive collar...!?"

————————————————————————————

CL...ANK

Citan
"Ah!
...Oh, dear!"

Hammer
"Th, th, that part is...!"

Fei
WWWAAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHH---!!!

Citan
"Fei!!
What is wrong!?"

Fei
"Errh, arrh...doc?
Wh, wh, what just happened?
Wh, what was that?"

Citan
"You scared the heck out of
me, suddenly shouting like
that. Is everything O.K.?
Anyway, are you absolutely
sure now? 
I will start removing the
explosive collar then..."

Fei
"Let's not do this!
I've a bad feeling about it.
Sorry, doc..."

Citan
"...I can understand that.
There is no reason to try
something so dangerous yet!
We have not explored all
the other possibilities.
There may be another way!"

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!
There is a way of having
these collars removed...
It requires you winning a
'Special Pardon' in the
Imperial Games, though..."

Citan
"A 'Special Pardon'?"

Hammer
"Yes. Every year they
hold the Imperial Games
of Battling.
The Kaiser himself watches
over the Battling matches
and cancels any sentence
the winner is serving.
Also the winner is given
a position as a military
officer as an added bonus!"

Citan
"Well then, all we have to 
do is win at the Games then!
Do we not, Fei?"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is 
hopeless!
To do that you will have 
to defeat the current 
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro here was
totally beaten by that
very person just days ago!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro, here was
just beaten by one of the
Champ's subordinates!
We don't even know
how strong the Champ
himself is yet..."

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
The Champ's prison ranking
is rank S! 
That's well above rank A 
even!
Our bro here is only rank
C. Our bro could very well
die if he attempts to
challenge the Champ!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current 
champion, Master Rico!
The Champ's prison ranking
is rank S! 
That's well above rank A
even!
Our bro here is only rank
C. Our bro could very well
die if he attempts to 
challenge the Champ!"

Hammer
"I am telling you it is
hopeless!
To do that you will have
to defeat the current
champion, Master Rico!
But our bro here, is the
same as I am...Rank D! The
difference from the Champ to
us is like man and mouse!"

Hammer
"And this time we're 
talking about Battling!
With Gears, bro, Gears!
There's no assurance of
your safety. He could very
well kill you by pretending
to cause an accident!"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Really?"

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
Yet if I were to come up
against him seriously...
I am not sure whether I
could win or not."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
I defeated 3 Battlers, but
I lost to the fourth, that
Suzarn woman... I might be
able to beat her, perhaps."

————————————————————————————
???

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them..."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Yeah...but last time
I didn't have the desire
to fight them...
I don't wan't to hide
behind the excuse that I
had not recovered from my
injuries at the time...
But the truth is I didn't
even beat one of them!
Who knows whether I could
beat them next time...!?"

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Is he really that much
stronger than the other 4
Battlers, this Champ chap?"

Hammer
"Put it this way...
He's the undefeated king,
reigning at the summit of
the Imperial capital's 
Battling Tournaments!
With a history of 40 bouts
ending in 40 K.O.s, most of
which occured within 30
seconds from start time...
If he wins this year's
Imperial Games then he'll
be the reigning champion
for three years running!"

Citan
"Just one second!
Is this person a 
prisoner?"

Hammer
"Yes he is."

Citan
"That is strange... The
winner is supposed to
receive a pardon, right?
Why is he still a
prisoner now then?"

Hammer
"That's the thing! Master
Rico could have said good-
bye to prison life by now!
But they say he turned
down his pardon.
I guess he must like his
fighting a great deal...!"

Fei
"Well, we can't just stand
round here talking about
it.
I don't care whether it is
Battling or whatever! If
there is a chance then I am
going to try and take it!"

Hammer
"Are you serious?"

Fei
"Yes, I am."

Hammer
"Do you think you can win?"

Fei
"No, I don't.
But, for now, I can
only give it a try!"

Hammer
"Well... If that's how it
is then I'll just go off
and register you now!"

Fei
"That Hammer...
He looked very pleased
all of a sudden!"

Citan
"...But are you alright
about this?
As we spoke about before...
Whether you are forced to
or not...you did not
want to do this, right?
Fight with Gears, I mean!?"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"There are most probably
other ways to get out of
here.
Fei, I do not want to
push you into anything 
you do not want to do!"

Fei
"I know doc.
I still don't like Gears.
That much hasn't changed.
When I pilot them, I become
aware of how unstable my
very 'being' is...even if
I don't want to think of it!
But at the same time, it is
also a connection with some
lost 'part' of me.
If that's the case then,
recently, I decided I would
stick with it to the end.
Elly also had been troubled
by the same thing. And if I
just stay depressed about
it, nothing will improve!"

Citan
"Is that how you feel...?
I think I understand
you better now, Fei.
Anyway, let us get
some rest today.
We are going to
become busy!"

Faster than we 
expected...

The awakening of the
untouchable one...

It has been 3 years
since we heard any news.
According to the memory
cube, 'he' is currently
in Nortune, the Imperial
capital of Kislev.

Detestable...
Vexing...
Cursed...

If only 'he' did not
exist, the Lambs would
not have been turned
into the 'Animus'.
It has been 500 years
since our fall in the
'Days of Destruction'
that 'he' caused...
We would not have had
to do this in such a
troublesome manner,
as we do now.

The excavation of the
'Anima Relics' in each
area is proceeding as
planned.
It's too late to change
things now.
But in the future, we'll
shape what will be.

Fade...
Vanish...
Disappear...

Although, we do not
know which route it
flowed from...
...we're fortunate
the 'gate keeper'
was activated.

From the 'Ethos'?
Or...

It doesn't matter.
Although...

So are you saying
that we mustn't
break Ignas'
equilibrium?

Well, it is the
surface...and that
land is unclean!

That is merely
an excuse.

It's a justifiable
reason. Even Cain
would not object.

But we can't use the
'Gaetia Key'.
Not until the proper
time comes.

There's a third fleet
in Bledavik. Their
reserve units will do.

Oh, his fleet.
Your orders?

To purge.
Give no motives. If he
knew our motives, it's 
obvious he'd do something
unpredictable.

But, wouldn't we
need more men to
raze the entire
area of Nortune?

There is an ancient
reactor in Nortune.
We'll use that.
The half-life fallout
will be 1000 years. 
Nothing will be able to
live within 300 kelts
of the explosion.
However, they've lived
through that before.
They won't perish
that easily.

But, we must at
least eliminate
'him'.

Yes.
There's nothing we need
from there. So be it,
take care of it.

If it is a
direct hit
...

Well then...

Your orders are given.
