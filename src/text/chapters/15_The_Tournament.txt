Citan
"Good morning.
Operation 'Rescue Margie'
is now underway!"

Citan
"First Fei and I will
prepare for the Tournament
at the arena.
When the Tournament starts,
Bart will enter the water-
way through the well and
head for the castle.
If you swim against the
current you should reach
the castle.
I am certain there will
still be some guards
there, so please dispose
of them quietly.
We will make a good show
at the Tournament to draw
the guards' attention as
long as possible.
During that time, you can
rescue Margie."

Any questions?
    Got it
    Once more, please

Citan
"Then let us go.
Be careful, young one!"

Man 1
Hey, are you gonna fight?
Hmm 
...I'd say about 20 to 1.

Man 2
To watch inside... 
Or watch outside...
That is the question...

Woman 1
Oh, hey! Those guys in
front are in the way! That
gets me sooo pissed!

Guard 1
Participant?
Okay, go on through.

Man 3
Get ready!
It's starting soon!

Woman 2
Hey, are you for 
Joe too?

Man 4
Big Joe's great 'cause
he's kinda shady.
Kids like you wouldn't
understand.

Man 5
Wanna join Joe's fan club?
If you join, you can come
to our weekly coffee.
We have a dinner show
once a month too.

Woman 3
Hey are you fightin'?
Give it up. No way you 
can beat Joe.

Guard 2
Recently the fighters have
been boring. It was better
when the King was around.

Boy
I come every year. This
is my third time. I only
have to see 'em once to
know who's the strongest.
Are you fighting?
You look pretty strong.
Um, maybe a semi-finalist.
Good luck.

Man 6
I hate war and fighting.
What? Oh I'm writing a book
on the folly of mankind.

Guard 3
These martial arts
tournaments are okay...
But what if Gears, not
people, fought it out?
I'd like to see that.

Woman 4
My son's in it! I hope
he doesn't get hurt. 
I'm so worried he's going
to get hurt.

Guard 4
Who's sarge betting on?

Guard 5
Me I'm for Big Joe.

Guard 4
No way, bad choice.
He's all hot air.
Believe me, Wiseman's 
gonna win.

Guard 5
Shut up! I was right
last time, I'm not 
gonna listen to you.

Guard 6
Wow! You picked the champ
last time? You musta got
something like 50 to 1...

Guard 5
Yep, that's the sarge. 
He's a man's man.

Old Man
I was born and raised in
Dazil but this is my 
first Tournament.

Little Boy
Hey, granpa... (??? spelling error)
Let's bet on someone too.

Grandpa
No, betting's for losers.
I brought you here because
I want you to grow up and
be a strong man.
Strong enough to fight 
in the Tournament someday.

Little Boy
Man, how lame.

Man 7
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be
HOT! I love the sound of
folks smackin' each other!

Old Man 2
If I was only 10 years
younger...cough...hack...
I'd whip 'em all...cough.

Woman 5
I want to see what kind
of fighters came. The best
men all joined the army.

Woman 6
I'm for the ones that
pay out big. Don't know
much about martial arts
though.
I sure could use a little
extra house money.

Arena Guard

to sit in the spectator's area.

Citan

The better you do, the
easier it will be for
Bart to sneak in."

I am strong...

    Nope

That's right...

Big Joe
"Hey, boy.
Do you know the
secret of strength?
It's...
Gratitude to all your
fans. Their love gives
me strength."

Hey, boy. Do you have
anyone cheering for you?
    Yes

Big Joe

Female Fighter
Do you think women
are weaker than men?
    I think so
    Not really

What? Don't you under-
estimate desert women!

You're just saying
that to impress me.

Everyone is so excited...
Isn't there a big

Isn't there?

There is no way I can 
lose.

Dan

Fei
"Dan...
Dan!
What are you
doing here?"

Dan

I'll never forgive you.
I'm gonna kill you!"

Fei
"...Dan..."

Guard
Attention all participants.
We will be starting soon.
Please enter the arena.

Dan
"You're the enemy of 
everyone in Lahan!
I'm gonna kick your butt
in front of everyone!
And don't be runnin' 
away either!!"

Fei
"D, Dan..." 

Mystery Man
"Hey Mister, are
you from Lahan?"

Fei
"??"

Mystery Man
"Seems like you and
that  boy have some
kind of problem..."

Fei
"Who do you think you are?
Mind your own business!"

Mystery Man
"Ha ha ha..."

Fei
"What's so funny?"

Mystery Man
"Nothing...
Just wondering what
kind  of fight you
will have with that
boy...
Well, I'm looking
forward to it,
'Fei'."

Fei
"Huh!?"

Fei
(How does that guy

I didn't enter my

I guess I better go
get ready too."

Sister
Is this plan really
going to work?

Bart
"It's already started. 
If something's wrong now,
then that's tough!
What're you worried about?
Fei'll do okay.
Besides Citan's with him,
too.
Now, all I gotta do is
sneak into the castle
through the well.
No problem."

Sister
I pray so.

Bart
"Well, I'm going.
Margie's waiting
in the citadel."

Sister
Well then...
do be careful.
And thank you for
helping Mother
Marguerite.

Bart
"No sweat!
You'd better get
outta Aveh now too.
Things are gonna get
outta hand soon."

Thank you.

Shakhan
...Brave young men are
spilling their blood on
the front lines. Our army
is the best, but the tides
of war are uncertain. 
To protect the tradition
of Aveh and preserve peace
in this desert, we must all
have unshaking resolve.  
The desert is a precious
treasure passed down to us
from our ancestors. Here we
can forge our minds and
bodies into one.
Our teachers are the sun 
and wind. 
We are gathered here today,
with our strong bodies
forged by the desert. 
The sun above us is the
same as that which burns
over our fathers at the
front. The wind blowing
here is the same as that
which whisks our resolve
and prayers to our sons at
the front.
This Tournament raises our
spirits and renews our
blessings from this desert
we live in.
Brave ones, warriors, fight
well and do not shame our
brothers at the front."

Let the 338th
Tournament begin!

Shakhan
"Hmm...a moving speech
if I do say so myself."

Shakhan
"Oh, Commander Ramsus. 
Sorry to have kept you
waiting. This way, please."

Ramsus
"I'm afraid I do not
have the time for such
gay revelry.
I just dropped by to
bid you farewell."

Shakhan
"What a pity. You do not
like our entertainment?"

Ramsus
"I find it boring."

Miang
"Oh, let it be Commander.
Shakhan is only trying to
show hospitality...
I personally find martial
arts quite interesting.
I look forward to seeing
the Tournament."

Shakhan
"To say this event is a 
tribute to you, Commander, 
is no understatement.
Your gracious help in our
time of need enabled us to
celebrate the country's
founding today."

Ramsus
"Founding, how impudent.
It's not even your 
country.
Hmph, do as you like."

Shakhan
"Miang, how about the
Tournament? Will you grace
us with your company?"

Miang
"Yes.
It would be
a pleasure."

Shakhan
"Oh, it's starting!"

Announcer
The first match...

Old Man
What!? Playing in the
reservoir again? Get up 
out of there now, boy!

Old Man
Kid, how many times
must I tell you...hmm?
How many years has it
been?
Well, haven't you grown
up? Are you really the
child I used to play
hide-and-seek with?
Is this some sort of
joke...?
Well, answer me!?

Bart
"What're you babblin'
on about?
Old man, even back when
I was a child you used
to ramble on and on. But
I see it's gotten worse."

Old Man
What!?
Ramble!?
Did you say I rambled on?
Why you little brat.
The only people who I ever
allowed to call me a rambler
were my late mother and the
young prince.
His Highness...
what was his name?

Bart
"You mean his Highness
'Prince Bartholomew'."

Old Man
Yes, his Highness Prince
Bartholomew! Boy, you 
certainly know a lot.
If Bartholomew was still
alive he'd be just about
your age...
Did you know that both
he and his family were
killed by that Shakhan?
You won't beat me, 
Shakhan. I'll protect
Aveh's water till I die.
In rememberance of the 
kindness of the king and 
the young prince.

I'll protect Aveh's water

Bart
"Really? Thanks old man. 
Father would be glad."

Old Man
? 
...Whaddya mean, father?
Are you the son of an
acquaintance of mine?
Wait wait, I remember...
! 
No, no, that's not it.
I don't recall the king
having any secret sons.

Bart
"Sorry but I don't have 
time to explain. You'll 
remember. See ya!"

Old Man
Who was that...?

Librarian
We must rewrite all
false history books
on the monarchy.
We also must get rid
of any books that
might cause problems.

But now, any pre-Shakhan
records are getting dated.
Strange how the present
becomes the past.

I am rearranging all the
records that were hidden
from Shakhan.
I was told to burn them,
but I hid them instead.

————————————————————————————

Man
Do you know the history of Bledavik?
    Yes, I do
    No, I don't

Wow, you know a lot.

————————————————————————————

Man
This city was built on a
desert rockbed. This was
partially to escape sand
erosion, but that's not
all.
An underground water basin
wells up here. The rockbed
is made of limestone, so
the water level continued
to rise to its present level.
Fatima Castle was originally
built to protect the water
source, but gradually the
desert people started to
live here.
They were soon joined by a
steady flow of people from
the northern lands.
That is the story of this
city, Bledavik.

————————————————————————————

Book Text
'Aveh's True History'
...In the dark days of the
Fatima rule, the people had
little to eat and even less
to be happy about.
Their hardships peaked during
the reign of Edbart IV...
Using the people's fury as
his power base, Shakhan, the
Prime Minister then, lead
the armies that broke the
tyrany of the Fatima dynasty.
Those heroes became the 
nucleus of Aveh's current
armed forces...

It is said the founder of Aveh,
one Roni Fatima, was part of a
desert caravan, but he probably
also had other sides to him.
The myths speak of the
involvement of giants in
battles that were part of
a massive power struggle.
Almost all the records from
that time have been lost, and
what little remains is doubted
as being historically correct.
But then Roni Fatima could have
been behind altering things.

General
...Due to confusing
orders, we were not able
to do well in our prior
campaign against growing
patrols around the ruins.
So we must immediately 
restructure our system
of giving orders.
Have you any ideas?

Soldier
General, the problem
is that pushy Major
Vanderkaum. He...

General
Hold your tongue!
I understand your resentment
towards Major Vanderkaum,
but we don't want any bad 
feelings with Gebler.

Soldier
I'm sorry. 
What about that new guy,
Ramsus? What about him?

General
I've heard he is 
rather talented...
He shouldn't trouble
us like that Vanderkaum.

Soldier
That surprise attack
was amazing.

Soldier 2
But, he is an outsider.
You can't trust him!

————————————————————————————

Soldier
Who's there? 

General
Stop daydreaming!
Arrest the intruder! 

————————————————————————————

???
Do you know what the
biggest problem is since
the end of the war with 
Kislev?
The excavation rights to 
the ruins in Dazil!
Soldiers in the area have
to protect those rights.
Drafted soldiers are being
sent home so career veterans
must be reorganized.
But until the reorganized units
arrive, the guards at the
ruins can't return.

here, Dan!?"

Dan
"Hmph!
I escaped from
Yui's place!
I'm here to avenge
my sister's death!"

Fei

Stop it!"

me to do...?"

"Damn you, Fei!
Why don't you
fight back?
C'mon,
I challenged
you!"

Fei
"...I can't.
There's no way I could
ever bring myself to
strike you, Dan..."

Dan
"...Darn!
Taking you down so
easily like this isn't
going to satisfy
the souls of my sister
or Timothy!
Blast! I'll save this
duel for later.
The next time I meet
you, it's going to be
your funeral! Scum!
Until then,
hang on to this!
Every time you look
at it,
I want you to suffer
and feel the guilt for
what you did !"

"Boo~! Boo~!"
"Booooring!"
"C'mon, fight properly!!"

Fei
(This is not good.
At this rate...)

Wiseman
"...Just as I thought."

Fei
"??"

Wiseman
"You, where did you
learn that technique?"

Fei
"Who cares where...
Come on, now...
Put up a serious fight!"

Wiseman
"Hmm.
So then why
do you fight?
For yourself?
Or for the sake
of others?"

Fei
"Why do you
ask that for?"

Wiseman
"Doesn't there have to
be a reason or a goal,
for a person to fight?"

Fei
"My reasons for
fighting are none
of your business!"

Wiseman
"So, you are you
fighting for no
reason or goal?"

Fei
"Would you shut up!
I'm in the middle of
finding for my purpose!"

Wiseman
"... Then forget it!
For there's no way
you could find such."

Fei
"What!?"

Wiseman
"You appear to be
looking forward...
...but in reality,
you are only
looking downward!
You're only looking
at yourself.
Like that, you will
find nothing."

Fei
"How would
you know...?"

Wiseman
"I know... By exchanging
blows with you, I can
tell a great deal..."

Fei
"Argh!
Shut up!!"

Wiseman
"Weak, weak... You won't
even graze me with those
kinds of attacks...
But superficially, at
least, it seems you've
matured physically."

Fei
"??"

Wiseman
"You've done well in
recovering from those
wounds, Fei..."

Fei
"!!
How do you
know my name!?
I deliberately didn't
use my real name when
I entered this contest.
And that thing about
me recovering from my
wounds...!? You aren't
who I think you are!?"

Wiseman
"...Hm!?"

Fei
"??"

Wiseman
"Oh my...
Is it already
that time...?
... I guess it can't
be helped...
I've got to be
on my way!"

Fei

I want to
ask you...!"

Spectators

It appears that
