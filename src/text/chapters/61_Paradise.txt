Paradise - Deus Chamber - 1914
————————————————————————————

In the depths we saw
an alien form. It was
partially rotted and
petrified...a giant,
grotesque being...
  'It' gave off an
  inexplicable air
  of intimidation.
 
Perhaps it was more
than a gut reaction.
Perhaps it was the
fear of the 'Absolute'
that came from the
very depths of our
inherited instincts...

Fei
"That...
was the ultimate power?"

The partially rotted thing
eventually self-disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even further...

The partially rotted
thing eventually
disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even
further leaving
that area behind...

Raziel - 1916
————————————————————————————

We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.

In its center were two
gently glowing objects.

It was the source
of divine wisdom...
It was 'Razael's Tree'.

And the cavern itself
was a giant computer
called Razael.

The wisdom of god,
hidden within Razael...
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.

A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them...

The creation of the
-Malakh- angel...
God's army to reign over
the vast universe with...
 
And the construction of a
divine ark...

These weapons were called,
'Yabeh', the inter-planetary
invasion weapon system.

What the Gazel Ministry was
pursuing was right here.

According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.

We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'       
...the central neural circuit
and power source controlling
the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...

When suddenly,
'HE' appeared.

Krelian
"Ah, the hidden data
from Razael's Tree...
Move away from there.
This matter is far
too weighty for the
likes of you."

We were so close!"

So close...!"

We were so close...!"

Fei
"We must protect it with
our lives! We can't let
them have the Razael data!"

Citan
"You handle them!
I will try and extract as
much data as I am able to!
If anything goes wrong...
I will destroy this place!"

Raziel - Grahf Battle Aftermath - 1918
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Uhhhh..."

Grahf
"I guess that's all
you can take for now.
Are you frustrated?
But that is...
'only natural'.
After all, you are
imperfect."

Fei
"Imperfect!?"

Grahf
"Yes.
You are lacking now.
The absence of wrath
is an impediment to
you utilizing your
true strength!"

Fei
"W, wrath...?"

Grahf
"The drive to massacre and
annihilate, the compulsion
to destroy your opponent...
Such wrath is power for the
soul! By eliminating your
foe, you attain your first
sublimation of that drive.
It is this very sublimation
that draws out the hidden
powers within oneself!
But, clinging to reason...
...suppressing your wrath
and desire, makes releasing
your true power a dream
within a dream for you.
You already know this...
When wrath appeared in
your heart, the machine
responded, did it not?
What drew out such power
from your machine was
truly the drive of your
soul... It was your 'Id'.
The sign of the purpose
you've been seeking...
The mark of a natural
born assassin!"

Fei
"You're wrong!
That's absolutely
untrue!"

Fei
"I, I am not 'Id'!
I..."

Grahf
"The time has come...
I'll take your soul,
and draw its power
out to the limit!"

Krelian
"Enough!"

Grahf
"Huh?
What are you
stopping me for!?"

Krelian
"He is bait.
If you kill the bait,
the precious bird we
wish to capture will
fly away.
You know...a very
important bird...
'needed to fulfill my
earnest desire'...
You understand, don't
you, Lacan...?"

Grahf
"...
Suit yourself."

Krelian
"We shall crucify them.
In the land of Golgoda,
to the west of here.
Collect all the broken
Gears!"

Nisan Council Hall - 1592
————————————————————————————

When Fei and the others arrived
at the deepest part of Mahanon,
I was looking after the newly
mutating people in Nisan...

People mutating, one
after the other...

Like some eternal nightmare
that made me wonder just
how long we would have
to keep on nursing them.

Margie
"Are you okay?"

Margie
"You haven't had
any rest have you?
I can handle things
on my own for a while.
Why don't you go out
for a walk?"

Elly
"Thank you.
But I'll be alright.
I'd rather keep busy
so that I won't worry
about things too much."

Margie
"Is that it?"

Margie
"Hey!
Elly, what's that?"

Elly
"This?"

Margie
"Can I see it?"

Margie
"Just as I thought...
It's the Pendant of Nisan.
But, why do you have it,
Elly?"

Elly
"It's Fei's. I'm holding
on to it for him...
But...
It feels as if I have
always worn it..."

Margie
"Hmm..."

Margie
"When you wear that,
you look even more
like Sophia!"

Elly
"Really? Hmm...
Flattery won't get you
anything, you know?
Anyway, we need to hurry up
and test the new mutation
suppressant assembler on
those other people there.
We can't afford to have
them change any further."

Elly
"Ah!"

Elly
"Oh-no...
Something has happened
to Fei and the others!"
