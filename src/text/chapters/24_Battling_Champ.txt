Fei
"...Is that all?"

Hammer
"Yep.
This is the best that can
be obtained 'round here."

Fei
"You think I can win with
these crude parts?"

Citan
"You have got a point.
Compared to the Champ's
Gear, the quality just
does not match up."

Hammer
"There's nothing we can do.
Master Rico's Gear is a
special make of Gear
provided by the Committee.
From maintainence to parts,
it receives the best of
everything.
As long as money is
involved, the Champ will go
all out.
That's one of the reasons
he's so powerful..."

Fei
"Can't we get better
parts? This..."

Hah ha ha ha ha!

Mysterious Voice
"As usual, you haven't
learned anything have
you?"

Fei

Fei
"You're the one...
from the Aveh
tournament..."

Fei
"What do you want?
I'm busy right now!"

Wiseman
"Hmph.
No matter how high
quality your Gear may
be, you won't be able
to defeat him."

Fei
"Wh, what're you
talking about!?"

!?

Hammer
"Yikes!?"

Wiseman
"You still do not
understand do you? Then
let me show you."

Take this...!"

Fei
"Whoa!"

Fei
"Y, you're

So put up a

Wiseman
"Fighting brute strength
with brute strength is a
sign of a great fool.
It's obvious that a lighter
body such as yours will
always be at a disadvantage
in a head-on attack.
I just gave you a good
example. That minor
difference between you and
I had this outcome.
Now, someone else with a
mass several times as you,
like Rico, the outcome
becomes highly apparent.
This applies to Gears
as well...
Even if you were to get
parts comparable to
Rico's, there is still
that difference in mass.
To make up for this, one
must commit to a single
final strike that thrusts
at the opponent's fissure."

Fei
"...?"

Wiseman
"I have given you the
hint.
It's up to you to figure
it out through experience."

Fei
"Wait! Why is it that you
have the same fighting
style as I!?
And, how do you know my
name!?
Tell me!"

Wiseman
"Hmph...fine."

Wiseman
"It was 3 years ago...
The one who took you, in
your mutilated state, to
that mountain village was
none other than myself."

Fei
"You're the one who
brought me to Lahan!?"

Wiseman
"...Yes.
At your father's
request."

Fei
"My father's...!?
What's your relation to
my father!?"

Wiseman
"Khan and I were
fellow students."

Fei
"...Khan? Is that my
father's name?"

Wiseman
"Why do you ask for your
father's name? You
haven't lost your...?"

Fei
"Yeah...
So tell me anything you
can. Will you?"

Wiseman
"I see...
In your injured state...
I wouldn't have been
surprised..."

Fei
"Wiseman."

Wiseman
"...Khan Wong.
That is your father's
name. Since our youth,
Khan and I studied the
martial arts together..."

Fei
"Father and you...?"

Wiseman
"...Yes. Eventually, your
father became an officer
of a certain country.
There he met a young
woman.
She was about 20 years old.
Her name was 'Karen'.
She was like a flower in
full bloom."

Fei
"Flower...?"

Citan
"He means that she was
extraordinarily
beautiful."

Fei
"I, see.
Then she's...?"

Wiseman
"Yes, your mother.
Khan married your mother,
and I left on a journey
to strengthen myself."

Fei
"Then my mother?
Where is my mother now?"

Wiseman
"You do not remember that
either? ...I see.
...According to Khan,
when you were but a
child, she passed away."

Fei
"Oh......"

Wiseman
"Time passed. During my
journey, I received a
letter from Khan."

Wiseman
"The letter said that,
his son...was taken away
by a man.
Khan once said you had
special powers.
The man who wanted that
power took you.
That man was Grahf."

Fei
"Grahf!?
He took me away!?"

Wiseman
"You've met him?"

Fei
"Yeah...
three times."

Wiseman
"It's amazing you are
still in one piece."

Fei
"It seemed to Grahf,
that I was still not
powerful enough to
achieve his ultimate
goal... Anyway, let me
hear more about this
story."

Wiseman
"Khan wished to go find
his son, and if possible,
he wanted my help..."

Wiseman
"I agreed to Khan's
request and began
searching for you...
...and that man."

Wiseman
"Then came that one
fateful night 3 years
ago.
There was a violent
storm. The storm felt
as if it was thrown at
us through sheer rage.
That night, Khan
notified me that he
had located his son.
So I headed for that
location, as if I was
drawn to it."

Wiseman
"You and Khan were
wounded badly.
I have no idea what had
happened between you two
and Grahf. By then, Grahf
had already gone.
I don't know why, but
probably he was driven
away by Khan.
Khan decided to pursue
Grahf and left me to
care for his son.
I provided you with the
necessary first aid and
left you in the custody
of those village people.
Then I followed after
Khan."

Wiseman
"You probably lost
your memory when you
were injured then."

Fei
"Why did my father
pursue Grahf?"

Wiseman
"I do not even know.
Just that he said it was
not only for the sake of
his son, but also for the
sake of the world, that
that man had to be
disposed of...He added
that if something were to
happen to him, I would
have to take care of the
rest...I haven't seen or
heard from him since."

Fei
"Grahf said that my
father was dead..."

Wiseman
"Hmmm... If Grahf has
been appearing in your
presence... then that is
a possibility... That is
truly unfortunate..."

Wiseman
"Do you remember anything
about your fighting
techniques?"

Fei
"Huh?
No...nothing..."

Wiseman
"Hmmm, your fighting
skills were probably
taught to you by Khan.
Khan and I both studied
under the same master.
That is why my techniques
are similar to yours."

Wiseman
"Well then, I must
be off."

Fei
"To where?"

Wiseman
"I will go find him.
I need to pinpoint what
his intentions are."

Wiseman
"...And also, for
Khan's sake."

Fei
"Just tell me one thing.
What country was my
father an officer for?"

Wiseman
"Are you going there?"

Fei
"I don't know.
There are other things I
have to take care of..."

Wiseman
"Yes."

Wiseman
"The floating land
which tries to hide
behind a wall, protected,
as if to conceal their
failure. That is Shevat."

Wiseman
"That is your father's
country."

Fei
"Shevat...?
The...floating land?"

Wiseman
"Farewell."

Fei
"Hey!"

Citan
"...What a mysterious
person.
Is this the second time
you have met him?"

Fei
"Huh? ...Yeah.
Since that tournament in
Aveh. He sure is a
mysterious person..."

Fei
"I probably won't
understand straight away
what he meant today...

Hammer
"What was all that
about!? He disappeared
like the w, w, wind!

Hammer
"I've only known you
since you arrived here!
What is this Aveh
tournament?"

Hammer
"What is going on!!"

Fei
But I think I get the
general idea. I might be
able to do something in
tomorrow's final round...
The differences in the
performance of the Gear
parts are not going to
influence the outcome...
...Well, not as much as I
thought before."

Citan
"Never underestimate the
situation.
You might lose pretty
badly if you think you
can just win by getting
a grasp of the concept."

Fei
"I know, doc."

Citan
"Well, let us return to
our quarters and rest,
Fei...
Your fate lies in the
outcome of tomorrow's
competition. You need to
preserve your strength."

Committee on you!"

his Gear equipped with parts
that are in violation of the
rules, or somethin'!"

Rico
"Shut up!!"

Rico
"...Don't embarrass me any
further...
How could such special parts
exist in the Imperial
capital anyway!?
Especially since you can't

Elly
"Dominia!?"

Helmholz
"...Dominia, who's that?
Hey, not the one from
the Elements...?"

Dominia
"It's been a long time 
Elhaym. The last time
was Jugend, wasn't it?"

Elly
"What are you 
doing here?"

Dominia
"This is a vital mission,
ordered from central.
I already have Ramsus'
orders. The Hecht is not
to be piloted by a
common soldier.
I will take the Hecht."

Dominia
"I didn't even need an
escort, but this was
also part of the plan.
This will be a
good fight."

Elly
"Wait! Tell me what our
target is!
You should know."

Dominia
"That's restricted...
but I guess I can tell.
The electric generator
in the eastern sector of
Kislev's Imperial capital.
The target is a reactor
left there by an ancient
civilization."

Elly
"The reactor!? If you
attack that then Kislev
will..."

Dominia
"Probably most of it
will be destroyed.
The rest will be
uninhabitable
for hundreds of years."

Elly
"Why are you doing this?"

Dominia
"To purge, why else?
You may know this already,
Kislev has the Gatekeeper.
The original gate is
controlled by those
vulgar Lambs.
This land barrier was
made by our predecessors.
The Lambs are trying to
destroy the gate.
Are you going to
allow that?"

Elly
"That may be so...
but do we have the right
to get involved?"

Dominia
"Does that bother you?
Since when did you have
a conscience?
War, strife, betrayal,
deceit are all that are
on the Lamb's minds.
Surely you should know
that by looking at the
fools in this country.
Just let them loose and
see what they'd do.
They would pillage and
loot our world acting as
if they owned it.
Advanced knowledge or
tools aren't necessary
for common house pets.
We must lead them where
they belong."

Elly
"You were originally
a land dweller.
So why...?"

Dominia
"I was chosen by the
Commander!
Don't look at
me the same as those
stupid Lambs!"

Dominia
"Yes, well...
You've shirked the duty
that was instilled in you
since your Jugend days.
Arguing with you is a
waste of time."

Dominia
"I was a surface dweller
myself, but I'm going to
purge the -Lambs-.
I want you, the Shepherds,
-Abel-, to see with your
own eyes what I can do."

the Champion... 
Is it not to your
satisfaction?"

Fei
"No, it's not that.
What about Rico...?"

Rue
"... Rico?
He's the 'ex-Champion'...
Now you are 'the Champion'!"

Fei
"But, what happened
to him...?"

Rue
"After the Finals League,
during the group league
bouts, his Gear went out
of control.
The out of control Gear
crashed into the Kaiser's
box seat, and was damaged.
Nothing has been heard
from the former Champion,
Ricardo, and no one has seen
him since the incident..."

Fei
"......"

Rue
"There are no Battling
competitions for a while
so you can rest up a bit.
The explosive collar has
been removed.
How about taking a walk
around 'A Block' - the
civilian area of Nortune?"

Fei
"...'A Block'...
civilian area?"

Rue
"The southeast part of
the Imperial capital...
It is called A Block or the
ordinary civilian area..."

Rue
"Well then, we shall
take our leave..."

Rue
"Anyway...
This room is yours to use.
Next door is your bedroom.
Oh...and, Fei.
Now you will be given the
title of Champion as well as
special S Rank priviledges."

Rue
"Well, congratulations
on winning the Battling
championship...
We were able to take some
very good data...
Ha ha hm.
One more thing, good news.
Kaiser Sigmund would like 
to meet you, Champion Fei.
Please stop by the Central
Administrative District.

Rue
"Well... good bye."

Citan
"So, you are now free in
both name and...reality,
right?"

Hammer
"So, what are you
gonna do now, bro?
Leave Nortune?"

Citan
"We are not yet finished.
There is one thing left
to do here."

Fei
"...I know.
It's Weltall, right?
We can't just leave
it here.
We have to get it 
back somehow..."

Citan
"It is best if we assume
Weltall has been moved
to a different dock..."

Citan
"So, I guess that is
where you come in,
... Hammer!"

Hammer
"Got it, doctor!
I'll find out where your
Gear is... I'll bet my name
as the 'Imperial capital's 
No.1 Supplier' on it!"

Fei
"Okay then, let's
work separately.
I'll work by myself,
while you, Hammer and
doc, work together..."

Hammer
"Bro, don't you trust
me or something?
I work better alone!
Nothing against Citan,
but he'll just get in
the way, bro."

"So then...
just leave it to me, OK!"

Ridiculous!
It shouldn't open unless it

couldn't open that easily!

Sigmund

"It doesn't matter...
Arrest the intruder.
The Battling Committee

Guard 2
Oh, Gear maintainence...?
I quit that job.

Guard 1
Why?

Guard 2
I don't wanna go to D Block.
I got bad memories there.
Anyhow, they'd send me back
if they found out I made it
this high up.

Guard 1
Oh yeah... You were
in D Block, right?

Captain
"When will we be able to
use our real power...?"

Operator 1
The 'Ethos' has been using
a human rights movement to
usurp political power.
In a recent parade, there
was an attempt on the life
of the Kaiser.
Fortunately, they failed,
but we don't know when they
might strike again...

Operator 2
Ever hear of a red Gear?
I hear it took out a Gebler
unit.
If only he'd be our savior.

Operator 3
Kislev and Aveh almost had
a truce once before.
But the relationship 
worsened due to Gebler.

Officer
Why do you think we have a
bridge here? Hah hah hah?

Operator 4
The power of the 'Ethos'
still exists as strong
as ever in Kislev...
But many ordinary citizens
died trying to oppose the
influence of the 'Ethos'.

Guard 3
A Gear decimated an elite
unit of Gears in Lahan.

Guard 4
Actually, there was one
survivor from Lahan.
But he seems to be going
through a mental breakdown.
What happened there...?
hat happened there...?

Guard 5
Never knowing when you may
get a mission can drive you
nuts.
If I knew it was gonna be
like this, I woulda stayed
at the docks fixing Gears.

Guard 6
I'm going on a mission soon.
I may not make it back, but
I'm still ready for it.

Good.
Above us is the bridge,

other related facilities.

Guard 2
Good job.
On the right hand side,
you can get to the 3rd

Guard 1
There's some suspicious
activity in Aveh. They
could attack anytime.

Guard 2
I saw your incredible
Gear in sub dock!
What's it called?

Guard 3
What is the Kaiser
thinking? Now's the only
chance to strike at Aveh.

Guard 4
This is the new battle
ship, Goliath!
With its completion,
Aveh and Solaris will
have to submit to us.

Guard 5
I'm doing some Gear
maintenance today at the
dock... But, they're
only battle Gears.
A lot of people go in an'
out without authorization.
It's good money.

Guard 6
I'm prepared to fight
even if I'm the last one.

Guard 7
Currently, Aveh is a
puppet government.
Ramsus, a Gebler officer,
is the one who holds the
true power.

Guard 8
Aveh and some pirates 
clashed at the border.
Something serious happened
there.

The crane is out of

It'll move by that

you'll only be able to
move it left or right.

Guard 1
He's back, I know it.
But his soul's not...
or his...hands...legs...
It's horrible...

Guard 2
Is that old man in charge
of the railway in D Block
still there? I owe him a
big favor.

Guard 3
Damn, why isn't it
moving? How am I supposed
to get the cargo out?

If we move the crane
up here, maybe we could
use it as a step so we
can get in further.

I've picked up the latest
information on your Gear!"

Hammer
"Hee-hee, I've pinpointed
where your Gear is bro!"

Fei
"... Hold on a second!
(Don't you think it's
dangerous to talk about
that stuff around here!)"

Hammer
"Huh?
What's with you, bro?
I have info on your Gea..."

Hammer
"Eeek!
Wha, wha, what the!?"

Citan
"I will explain later!
Just move it, O.K.!"

Where are you going?
Hey, are you listening?"

Hammer
"Waaaaaaiiiii----t!"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"It should be safe here.
Now Hammer, tell me where 
my Gear is."

Hammer
"As the doc predicted, bro,
your Gear has been moved to
another dispatchment dock."

Citan
"So, where on earth 
is Weltall?"

Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!
I've checked into it and 
found out that there are
two routes we can use to 
sneak inside.
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds.

Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena! What's the second?"

Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves 
the supply train tunnel.
You have to get into the
tunnel's ducts and follow
them right through till
they lead to the docks.
But I couldn't find out
the duct's layout...
Sorry, bro."

Fei
"...Oh that tunnel, huh?
Well, now that we have the
bomb problem off of our
necks, we might be able to
make a go of it!"

Citan
"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing the times
that the trains pass by on.
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"

Fei
"Not all of this has to be
decided now. Let's take our
time and plan it carefully!"

Fei
"Firstly Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but...
Could you find out the days
and times that the supply
trains operate on for us
please?"

Hammer
"I'll get right on it, bro.
Well then, I'll be off!"

Citan
"Shall we also return
to D Block for the 
time being?"

This city's other name is
"the town of steam" because
steam is being blown out of
everywhere the eye can see.
Due to this, whenever you go
out of your house you come
back pitch black all over!
It also roughens your skin!

So why am I outside then?
You shouldn't be so picky
about such little details!
I have my reasons!

Woman with blue hair
They say the world's a big
place, but there's no other
town nearly as big as our
capital city, anywhere!
They say there's an even
bigger city in the skies
above, but I ask you, who's
ever seen a floating city?

We've travelled through
most of Ignas... When
will he ever look at me,
and not these weapons...?

Man
All these weapons,and none
that fit me.Guns are too
dangerous,and swords are
heavy and bulky...

Sigh...isn't there a

This is it,...

you please move? You're

Wh, whatever...I have
to do? Right now, I don't

Assistant Cook
Argh! I failed again.
Hmmm, there's just
something not right with
the special sauce.
Ether cuisine has a lot
of depth to it.

Failure is an important
step to my path to success!
It's my dream to become
just like that first Ether
cook over in D Block.

Army Cook
"I'm the cook for the
Imperial barracks.
I can get in trouble for
having you guys in here.
If you have no business
here, please leave.
Moreover, you aren't
even soldiers.
I thought that I told
them strictly not to
allow civilians in.
Man...what am I going
to do."

Soldier 1
I'm a new recruit for the
Kislev military. I just
graduated from the Imperial
officer school as an elite!
So, why did they put me in
A Block working under the
chief cook?

Battler Soldier
"The lecture's about to begin.
Although it's short, it's such
a bother. Please don't talk
to me right now."

Lecturer
For today's lecture we will
discuss the movement of
Gears on the world map.
I understand that most of
you are ex-Battlers and are
well acquainted with Gears,
but it should be no loss for
you to re-learn the basics.
First, the limits to the
area of movement of Gears...
It is impossible to walk
through dense forests in
a Gear!
Instead of being hasty, just
press the L2 and R2 buttons
simultaneously and you will
all get off your Gears.
Once you pass through the
forest, you may once again
get on your Gears! That is
all for this lecture...
Any questions?

...If there are no
questions, class is
dismissed. Oh yes, I
forgot one thing...
This is common sense,
but movement over
water is not possible.

Amazon Soldier
"Argh, this sucks. He
thinks it's a lecture but
all he does is say the
same thing everyday.
Compared to this, I was
fighting a lot more in my
Battling days.
Now that was living.
Maybe I should quit the
military..."

Lecturer
Whew, it was another
wonderful lecture today.
I'm even awed at myself.
...I'm sure looking
forward to tomorrow's 
lecture.

Battler
Just a while ago I was
pretty active in the
Battling tournament.
Then those people from the
committee scouted me out.
Heh, it's good to be a
soldier.

Soldier 2
In the northern part of the
capital, in the industrial
block lies a relic from an
ancient civilization...
a giant 'reactor'.
That reactor produces power
beyond our ability to control.
It's something man will
never be able to wield...

Soldier 3
There's been some
information that
suggests Aveh is doing
something suspicious.
This balance we've 
had with them isn't
going to last...

Now we're training
for the Kaiser Sigmund

and...hey, who're you?
There are a lot of high
officials in this room,
we want to impress them
and get promotions.
So beat it.

Now, start again!
Hey, out of the way!

Officer
Hmm, that young one
over there...
It's a shame to keep him
a private...
But, that one over there's
been sitting there all
this time. Who is he?

Soldier 2
Hmm, no matter how much
I sleep, it's not enough.
I still feel weak...
The more I sleep the more
lethargic I get.
They say sleep makes strong
children...is that true?

————————————————————————————
???

Uuuh, now I can't fall
asleep... I keep
thinking Aveh might attack
any minute now I can't get
to sleep...
Ahh,I hope this war
ends soon.

Well,they liked me
fairly well, but
the officer pressing for
my promotion died in the
last air assault. 

That opportunity was
right in front of me.
...Life is harsh. At this
rate, they're going to
send me out to the battle
field.

Soldier
Damn! Why's his rank higher

he's good at Gear combat?
I'm still his senior.

...Life isn't fair.
What's so great about
Battlers!? Dammit!

Amazoness
Probably doesn't want
to lose to anyone else.
Well, it doesn't matter
to me. If you keep taking
those people seriously
everytime, it's not going
to be worth it...

He's got too much pride.
It's not like we've ever
been overly proud of him.

Come on, it's me, the

Don't you remember?"

Fei
"...!? You, the one from
D Block!"

Woman
Yeah, now you remember.
Long time no see. Oh,
you got that collar off?

Citan
"Yes, he became the
Battling Champ.
He is no longer a
prisoner."

Then you're the Battling
Champ? Wow! That's great!
I knew you were strong.

And you might be?

Citan
"Oh, excuse me, we have

I am Citan Uzuki. 
You could say that I

"Presently, I am the

Hold on!! Why is the (???Text gets cut off)
D Block doctor here?

Citan
"Huh? Uh, well...
that is..."

Sigh, what's going to
happen if someone gets
injured now!? Who's going
to look at the injury?
Don't you feel an
obligation as a doctor
to...Dr. Uzuki, don't
you have any
responsibility!?

Citan
"I, I am extremely
sorry."

That's what I heard from
Hammer."

Woman
Aaahh, that.
Following the request of
the empire, I agreed to
be in charge of this part
of the city, but now
they're telling me they
already have enough
doctors...

Who do they think they
are? So, for now, I'm
just on standby. As long
as nothing really big
happens, I think I'm
going to be here for
quite a while...

Fei
"...I know I'm in no
position to ask you, but
do you think you could
return to D Block?"

Woman
Isn't Dr. Uzuki in
charge of D Block?
I can't just do that.

Fei
"Well it's about that.
...We're leaving the
capital soon.
Of course
doc will be with us.
So...it would be good if
you could take care of
D Block."

Woman
I see you've got your
own problems... Okay,
leave D Block to me. And
also, if you have any
other problems, come to
me. I'll try to help in
any way I can."

Citan
"I am sorry about this.
Please take care of
everyone."

Fei
"Thanks, I owe you one."

Nun
Hang in there.

Woman
I too had been thinking of
leaving from the Imperial
capital...
But then I came to think
that if I try harder things
will get better......
You too try your hardest, OK!

————————————————————————————

Woman
Oh, yes. Next time,
please knock! Then I will
open the door for you.
If you come through the
toilet............
ya...you know! It might
be at the wrong time.

Fei
"......Uh, yeah. You're
right... I understand.
And, how many knocks?"

Woman
Hmmm, let's say......
'2, 1, 2'... Would 
that be okay?

Fei
"Got it.
2, 1, 2... right?"

Woman
Uh huh, yes.
Well then, good luck.
