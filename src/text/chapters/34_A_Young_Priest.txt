Captain
"The Etones?
Oh, those guys who were
here earlier...
They left saying they had
to go investigate something.
They might be on the deck
near the supply entrance."

Man
Etone? I saw him
earlier but he left.

Margie
"Really? 
Where'd they go?"

Man
I don't know...

Bart
"What're you 
doing Margie?"

Margie
"Hi, Bart. I just heard
from Citan. I also was
looking for that Etone.
This person's seen that
Etone before."

Bart
"Really?"

Hey, quit resistin'!!

Elly
"Bart!!
Look!!"

Slaver 1
If you wouldn't resist I
could sell you for more.

Elly
"What are you doing?"

Slaver 1
What the?
Who are you?

Slaver 2
Instead of the brat
why don't I sell
you off?

Bart
"What! You want some!?
Come get some ya losers!"

Slaver 2
You think you're all
that!?

Slaver 1
Wha!

Slaver 2
What the!?

Slaver 2
You!
What're you doing?

Slaver 1
Wait,
this guy's...

Slaver 2
Oh no...
Jesiah!!

Damn,
I'll remember this!

Bart
"What do you think 
you're doing?"

Jesiah
"Don't move."

Margie
"Wa, wait..."

Jesiah
"Shut up, 
you dog of Solaris."

Elly
"..."

Wait!!

Citan
"A carbine rifle,
that gun technique,
you must be Jesiah.
No Jesiah, you are
misunderstanding.
You always rush into
things. She was only
helping the girl."

Jesiah
"What? 
Butt kissin' talker, is
that you Hyuga..."

Girl
"..."

Jesiah
"Yeh yeah, I know,
Primera.
My misunderstanding."

Jesiah
"Sorry, young lady.
Please, stand up."

Jesiah
"Looks like you were 
just trying to help. That's
what she says.
Sorry about the
misunderstanding. This is
Primera. My daughter.
I am...
Call me Jessie. It's
enough that the little
brats call me Jesiah."

Primera
"..."

Elly
"?"

Jessie
"She says thank you.
Something happened to her
and she hasn't spoken 
since then."

Citan
"...Is this the girl
that brought about your
shotgun wedding?"

Jessie
"That's a damn rude thing
to ask! Look at how old
she is.
Primera is my
second child. That other
kid is already 16."

Citan
"Please excuse me.
How is your wife?"

Jessie
"...She's dead.
I wasn't even there for
her when she died."

Citan
"I see...
What are you doing here?"

Jessie
"I have to go shopping 
sometime.
Besides my son 
has some unsavory
business in this area..."

Man
Ah...
That Etone you were looking
for has just arrived.

Bart
"What!? Where?"

————————————————————————————

Doctor
"......is the reason why,
so somehow, we need your
help."

Etone
"I see......"

Jessie
"Quit beating 'round the
bush and just help."

Etone
"Fa, father?
And Prim too?"

Jessie
"This is my son Billy."

Billy
"Where have you been until
now?
Things are pretty
serious at the
headquarters."

Jessie
"What do you mean serious?
What's wrong with going
out shopping with my
daughter?"

Billy
"I don't know the details
but you have been labeled as
an undesirable element.
What did you do this time?
Fight? Gamble? 
Go after someone's wife
again!?"

Jessie
"Hmmph, that's just a
rumor about me. A rumor.
Don't you believe that.
Ever since you went into
the 'Ethos' you've become
such a stiff."

Billy
"..."

Jessie
"This lady prevented
Primera from getting
kidnapped.
Why don't you just
help out?"

Elly
"Well...can we get an
introduction to the
'Ethos' then?"

Billy
"Oh yes, please excuse my
rudeness. I didn't know
you saved my sister.
Let me contact the
medical department
at my headquarters.
I have other matters I
must attend to, considering
I am not only a priest but
also an Etone...
So I cannot make any
promises."

Elly
"Then you'll introduce
us?"

Billy
"Yes. Let's stop by the
'Ethos' headquarters
after this."

Margie
"Hmm. A priest and an
Etone at the same time...
Isn't that unsual?
The 'Ethos' is obviously
very different from my
Nisan Sect."

Billy
"Your Nisan Sect? Are
you from Nisan?"

Margie
"Yep, I'm Marguerite. 
Nice to meet you, Father."

Billy
"The pleasure is mine.
I've never had a proper
chance to speak to others
about their religions.
Can we talk later?"

Margie
"Sure, that's fine. 
But I can't take that 
much time. I'm a little 
busy now."

Billy
"Thank you.
Hmm...Marguerite? 
Where have I heard that
name before?"

Bart
"Forget about it,
relax...
I came here to talk
to the 'Ethos'.
Let's get moving."

Billy
"What an impolite fellow.
You should learn how to
speak a little more
politely."

Bart
"Why you!"

Billy
"Well everyone, 
I'll go tell the
'Ethos' headquarters
that you're coming.
When you've taken
care of business here,
please come by the
'Ethos'."

Bart
"I know, I know. 
Let's go." 

Jessie
"Hey Billy, I have 
some business to take 
care of.
If you're going back to 
the headquarters can you
take Primera back to the
brat house for me?"

Billy
"......Alright.
Let's go Prim."

Jessie
"Alright, well I've got
to get going.
Later Hyuga.
I know I'll be seein' you
around."

Citan
"Uh, who knows."

Jessie
"Well, whatever.
See you ladies later."

Citan
"He never changes..."

Citan
"Sigurd said he would be
done with the Yggdrasil
soon."

Bart
"What, really?
Alright, this time we can
really leave port."

Elly
"Are we returning...
to Aveh?"

Bart
"Are you kidding?
We've got to take
care of Fei first.
That smart aleck kid
said he'd introduce
us to the 'Ethos'.
So I guess we'll just
have to go to the 'Ethos'
headquarters then..."

Elly
"...Thank you."

Bart
"Why do I have to get
thanked by you?"

Margie
"Heh, that's right,
Elly."

Elly
"...Yes, you're right."

    Leave Thames.
    Changed my mind.

When I come here at night I

But when I get closer, the

they are lonely, too.

What do you wanna do

Come again.

Crew 1
Jerico has been careful
lately, so navigation
has been made easier.

Crew 2
I got a new map!

Crew 3
We increased the antennas,
but now I can't keep track
of everything because I
don't have enough selector
channels... Drats!!

Crew 4
Hmmm, the rudder doesn't work
as well as it did in sand...
It doesn't feel secure or
seem to be reliable at all!

Hmm, so in water the rudder
has to be gently engaged
before trying to turn.
Guess I learned something.

Crew 5
Water torpedoes are
built much more simply
than sand torpedoes.
Thanks to that, their
power is double that of
our previous ship's arms.
But they're expensive.

Crew 6
I don't have to do delicate
effect wing movements anymore,
but it's harder to keep
balance than it was on sand.

Sigurd
"Shall we launch
the Yggdrasil?"
    Go ahead!
    Wait a while.

Ethos Cathedral - 1284

Etone 1
This is a practice hall.
This facility was built 
for us Etone.

Elly
"Can't we go into 
the cathedral?"

Etone 1
No.
Only 'Ethos' members or
those with known identities
can enter the cathedral
and its related facilities.
The same thing applies to
this practice hall, but the
bishop made an exception
for brother Billy.

Etone 2
The 'Ethos' was created
to save people--
to save people's souls and
revive lost technology.
We wish happiness to all
the people of the world.

————————————————————————————

Billy
"We have been waiting
for you.
I received permission
to treat Fei so long as
it is in the practice
hall's infirmary.
Let us 'Ethos' staff
take care of the rest."

Elly
"Please,
take care of Fei for me..."

————————————————————————————

Billy
"The brothers from the
'Ethos' are looking after
Fei in the infirmary.
Let me take you there.
Please follow me,
this way."

Billy
"This way."

Verlaine
"Billy, I hear your
father has been
rather active again."

Billy
"..."

Verlaine
"It is said that there was
an attack on an excavation
site which injured many of
my 'brothers' and workers."

Verlaine
"Well, you're such a fine
Etone - destroying Reapers
and proving the justice of
the 'Ethos' to the world.
But your father is..."

Billy
"We are father and son in
blood only! I have nothing
to do with that man..."

Verlaine
"Don't get me wrong.
I don't suspect you,
our good 'brother'.
I just wanted to
inform you about
your father."

Billy
"...That father of mine...
I wish he'd think about my
position before acting."

Billy
"How is he?"

Clergyman
The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,
but we see no abnormality
with his brain.
The low water temperature
lowered his metabolism and
saved him.
One false step and he
could've suffered from
brain death.

Bart
"That means..."

Clergyman
Yes, don't worry.
However, we need to conduct
more tests for a while.
After that, he can be
treated at your medical
facilities.

Elly
"...Will Fei ever 
regain consciousness?"

Clergyman
The reason why he hasn't
regained consciousness is
physical exhaustion.
He overworked himself. 
It'll probably take him a
few more days, but don't
worry, he'll wake up.

Elly
"...I'm sorry, Fei.
I caused the engine room
to lose control..."

Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.
More importantly,
you saved Fei.
Fei could not have
been protected from
Kahr without you.
Is that not correct?"

Elly
"Thank you..."

Bart
"Hey, we don't want to 
disturb his recovery.
Let's take a little walk.
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."

Elly
"I...would like to
stay a little while.
Is it okay?"

Citan
"I agree.
Fei will feel at ease
that way. Please let us 
know when you finish
treating Fei.
We will leave the rest
up to you."

————————————————————————————

Billy
"All we can do is 
wait and see."

Clergyman
He is in stable condition.
His treatment is almost 
complete.

Ethos Church Library - 1304
————————————————————————————

Scholar 1
Do you know about the huge
tower called Babel Tower?
They say it's built by
people who tried to reach
a god in the sky.
According to tradition, god
became angry with their
disrespect and his thunder
destroyed the tower.

Scholar 2
People who built Babel
Tower were so afraid of
god's revenge they ran
away to the sky.
That place is Shevat, the
'house of sinning hermits'.

Scholar 3
I've been assigned to
go to the excavation
site in Dazil.
I'm to review the
technical information
of the ruins once again.

Scholar 4
There are tons of books
collected by the 'Ethos'
stored in this library.
It's a real treasure
house of information.

Etone
The Bishop's been worried
about Reapers, refugees,
Etone, the faith...

there now. More than we 
can handle...
What are 'they'
thinking?")

————————————————————————————
Ethos Church Bunk Chamber - 1286
————————————————————————————

Etone 1
Plundered by war and
salvagers... Destruction
by the Reapers...
We must meet the people's
expectations toward the 
'Ethos'.

Etone 2
Reapers are humans turned
into things by god to pay
for their crimes.
They're sealed in the
cursed land of the heavens,
Shevat.

Etone 3
They say Babel Tower is 
connected to Shevat. The 
exit is under close watch 
by our people.
In spite of that, 
cursed Reapers continue to 
appear in this land.
That's why the Etone are 
here to eliminate them.

————————————————————————————

Etone 4
People belonging to the 
'Ethos' must act modestly
with generosity.
To do that we often read
from the sacred scripts
to return to a purer soul.

Etone 5
We, the Etone, are the
swords and shields of the
'Ethos' so to speak.
We fight with enemies
such as Reapers
and thieves to save 
people with faith in god.

————————————————————————————

Etone 6
Aha! You!
Ask Billy if his dad holds
a grudge against the 
'Ethos' or not.
They say his father bombed
the 'Ethos' supply dump.
Oh, my head hurts.

Why does Jessie attack
the 'Ethos' buildings?
I heard he was once an
amazing Etone...

————————————————————————————

Etone 7
This room was prepared 
for people who have no 
one to turn to.
We hope to save their 
souls and give them hope
to live.

Little Girl
Um...someone from the
'Ethos' got in a huge
Gear and saved me.
Some man named master
attacked us...It was
very frightening.

Old Woman
Everyone...
Everyone died.

Clergyman
Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.

Citan
"Did Fei regain
consciousness?"

Clergyman
Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't regained
consciousness yet. But
there's no need to worry.
When he recovers physically,
he'll also regain
consciousness. You can
take him to your ship now.

Bart
"Thanks a lot!"

Clergyman
Please don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.

Elly
"Um...Where is Billy?
I'd like to thank him..."

Clergyman
Oh yes, brother Billy...
He went back to the
orphanage.
He was worried about the
children left behind.

Citan
"We are in Billy's debt.
We should go thank him."

Bart
"First, let's take Fei to 
the Yggdrasil. We can go 
thank him afterwards."
