Sigurd
"I went to the tool shop
to borrow a table.
The owner said...
'if we need anything for
the young master, just
ask for it.'"

Bart
"I'm grateful."

Bart
"When I was a kid, I
borrowed stuff from there
and got in big trouble."

Fei
"Borrowed...
What did you take?

Bart
"A toy boat.
...I think that's what
it was.
I put fireworks in it and
let it float on the
cathedral's lake. I always
used to play 'navy'."

Bart
"I'm not sure, but I
think I pretended the
lake was the open sea...
...and I was the fleet
commander."

Bart
"Anyway...forget those
old stories.
We should get started."

Bart
"First...
Gebler is the
big problem."

Citan
"Yes, Ramsus is headed
towards achieving his
goals.
That he is now the
commander of Gebler
is proof of that.
A normal man could not
progress so quickly
through that country's
organization.
And now he is presently
located here in Ignas."

Citan
"Frankly, the situation
is not very favorable.
We need to somehow find
a weak spot and attack
it with all our might."

Bart
"First, let's just
concentrate on Shakhan.
Once he's out of the way
and Aveh is safe again,
we can think about how
to deal with Gebler."

Bart
"With our present strength
we should be able to hold
off the royal guard forces.
The problem is how to deal
with Gebler in the mean
time...
They will most likely move
at Shakhan's request.
They're not just gonna sit
by and watch quietly."

Citan
"...May I have a
look there please?"

Citan
"In short, we want Gebler
to leave for a while...
At least until we are able
to take back the Royal
Capital, Bledavik."

Citan
"These are the Gebler 
units currently in Aveh, 
correct?"

Citan
"The western guards..."

Citan
"the Royal Capital
defense force..."

Citan
"and...units along
the front line at the
border with Kislev."

Citan
"There are three main
groups.
Each is made up of a
mix of Gebler and Aveh
forces. Only two of
these are very large."

Citan
"The Royal Capital's
defense units and the
Kislev border units.
The western guard along
Nisan's border are little
more than a surveillence
team."

Sigurd
"In order to recapture
the Royal Capital...
...it will be necessary
to draw these defense
units away from Bledavik."

Citan
"We have some Kislev
made Gears, correct?"

Bart
"Yeah, we captured 
some earlier."

Citan
"What if we use those
Gears to make a raid on
the western guards...
...here at the border
with Nisan?"

Bart
"I see. We'll draw them
out by making it look like
Kislev is invading Aveh."

————————————————————————————
Recapture Aveh - Nisan Town Hall - 0782

Sigurd
"But the problem is...
will attacking the border
guards be enough to set
the center in motion?"

Citan
"To be sure then, Nisan
will just have to appear
to align with Kislev.
If they see it that way,
they will certainly make
a move."

Bart
"You're saying that you
intend to use Nisan as
bait?"

Fei
"Doc!?"

Sigurd
"Shakhan is very
sensitive to Nisan's
and Kislev's actions.
If Nisan starts moving
he will probably leave
it up to Gebler, but..."

Citan
"Of course I do not
wish to do that from
the beginning.
But looking at the
situation, we have to
be willing to go that
far."

Hmm...

Bart
"First, we infiltrate
into the capital.
To take out Shakhan,
we'll have to meet
up with our agents
already in the city."

Citan
"We are forgetting
one thing...
The front line units
along Kislev's border."

Bart
"...!"

Citan
"The main strength of
Aveh's fleet is the
battleship Kefeinzel.
It's been in service
since the reign of
the last king.
Because of its fire-
power, the whole unit
is nicknamed the
'invincible fleet'.
I recall yesterday's
intelligence report
said that the ship
is near the border."

Bart
"Damn...
That puts everything
in jeopardy!"

Citan
"Do not feel so down.
I simply wanted you
to see the current 
distribution of force
in the area.
Even in the worst case
that they do come, it
will not be such a great
problem."

Bart
"What do you mean?"

Citan
"I have some additional
information about Aveh's
border fleet.
The former Aveh supreme
commander was transferred
there.
Not really transferred,
more like demoted...
His name is Vanderkaum."

Sigurd
"Vanderkaum..."

Sigurd
"You don't mean the
Vanderkaum that was
in Jugend?"

Citan
"The very same."

Citan
"Young one, he has not been
able to adapt to the change
in tactics...
particularly following the
introduction of Gears...
He is a man who will never
stray from his dependence
on large naval guns."

Bart
"You mean, he's stubborn.
He is all size and no
real military power.
An excellent target for
pirates."

Maison
"Young master!
This is not going to
be an act of piracy!"

Bart
"Just kidding."

Citan
"Actually, the number of
Gears assigned to the fleet
seems to have been reduced."

Citan
"Even with that...
how gallant of him to
be so self-righteous."

Bart
"Is he that much of
a muscle head? It'll
be fun taunting him."

Maison
"Young master!"

Bart
"I know! I know!
Anyway, Citan, do you
think he can strike
our Gear forces?"

Citan
"It is not a problem.
Even with Vanderkaum, we
have enough forces left
to pull off the feint.
However, it would not be
wise to underestimate our
opponents."

Sigurd
"Well, now that we know
what we are up against,
here's what we'll do..."

Sigurd
"Apart from our main unit
heading for Bledavik...
we must keep the fleet
at the Kislev border from
returning to the capital."

Bart
"So you're suggesting
we have another unit?"

Citan
"A few effective soldiers
to hold the enemy at bay...
A small force is best."

Sigurd
"A small force...?"

Citan
"What if Fei leads a
group of Gears there?"

Yes, let me do it.
When do we leave?"

Bart
"...Are you sure?"

Fei
"We've come this far...
Hey, we're friends to
the end, now!"

Citan
"Speed is everything.
We should do this as
soon as possible."

"Alright, tomorrow!"

Or are you feeling sad

He'll be the leader of this

That's why I call him my

Woman
So it has finally begun.
My late father always said,
"Don't miss the greater
happiness by being misled
by minor sufferings."!
It hurts me to see our
children placed in danger.
But if it moves our country
in the right direction,
then it's in their benefit.

Young Woman
I had no idea...
Why, the Great Mother
is younger than I am!?
I'm new here, so I don't
know much...
I don't know exactly what
is going on, but let's just
avoid any trouble now, okay!?

Old Woman
Most of the families with
children have evacuated.
They were afraid of getting
caught up in a battle here.
It's so lonely now.
How I miss them...

"Our comrades in Nisan will

We'll wait for the right
moment, then head for the
palace in the Yggdrasil!"

Bart
"Got it.
But avoid any unnecessary
deaths.
This especially goes for
the Aveh troops and also
the people from Gebler."

Sigurd
"Yes.
We understand."

Fei
"I guess I'm going to
raise some hell in my
Weltall then."

Sigurd
"We're counting on you!"

Maybe, 'Your Majesty'...?"

The royal brothers and their
wives oversaw many prosperous
reigns or eras.
I'm looking forward to the
day, when as the Great Mother
of the Nisan Sect...
you will take your place on
the throne as Bartholomew's
wife."

Margie
"What!? Hey, hold on!
I hate talking about
queens and romance...!
Bart and I are best
friends!"

the best friendship."

"Well Marguerite, at the
rate that you are maturing

longer."

Got it?"

O.K.!

The time has
finally come.

I'm pumped!

Bart
"Though the warship is
outdated, you're only
going in as a small unit.
It's going to be a tough
fight, but you could
change Aveh's future.
I'm counting on you."

Maison
"At long last we are
heading to Bledavik
tomorrow...
Though he is the prince,
our young master doesn't
know the Royal Capital
very well...
I'd always felt that was
an awful pity. But despite
that, I tried my best to
raise him as Crown Prince.
However, looking back, I
might have put too much of
the 'burdens of kingship'
on him too early in life...
And it might have been too
much for a child with a
future like his to handle.
...
I must be the most
terrible minder ever!"

Citan
"My dear Lord Maison...
I hardly think that
is right!
The young one would have
taken the burden off of
himself had he not wanted
to bear it any longer!
He is a fine man now...
far capable of handling
any such burdens or
pressures.
And I believe you are
the very ones who have
given him the strength
to do so."

"Why such a glum face?
Tomorrow is our first
return to your castle
in 12 years."

Bart
"Returning to the castle...
After we get the royal
palace back, I guess I'm
going to be the king...
...I'm not very suited for
it, am I?"

Sigurd
"You'll get used to it."

Bart
"Listen, Sig..."

Sigurd
"Yes?"

Bart
"I guess it really...
doesn't matter who the
king is, does it?
As long as it's a symbol
of hope, right?
It doesn't have to be me."

Sigurd
"I was kidnapped by Solaris
and brainwashed for use as
a human guinea pig."

Sigurd
"But, even they couldn't
erase my desire to return
home.
Then, I remembered you and
Marguerite, not as the
royalty of our country but
as just normal children.
I don't care about
rebuilding a dynasty.
I want to regain this
kingdom because it
belongs to you...
Because it's your home!"

Bart
"Because it's my home?"

Sigurd
"Yes.
For that, we must take
Shakhan down tomorrow.
Am I correct?"

Bart
"...Right.
Then, let's do it!!"

Sigurd
"But first...
I think you need
to take a bath!"

Bart
"A bath!?"

Sigurd
"You don't look
like a king at all!
You are facing the
enemy's leader...
so you must have a
noble appearance!"

didn't matter whether
I'm a king or not!!"

You are a great man,

way wrong!!"

Renk
"Vance!!
Get a hold of yourself!"

Vance
"Oh yeah!?
I just need more!
I need more 'Drive'!!"

Elly
"...I can't do it.
I can't...fight
Fei...but..."

Elly
"The only thing left...
is to use the 'Drive'...
 
         But..."

W, what are you doing?

Don't worry.
It's just the 'Drive'.

The 'Drive' will
just readjust your
balance and make
you feel good.

I don't want it!
I, I don't want to use it!

You think we're going
to make an exception
because your father's
top brass?

Please!
Go away!

You have no recollection?
         There were no records on
         mental enhancement drug
         use up until now.
Then it was sudden.
         She's probably a type that
         can't handle the 'Drive'.
That probably caused her
lapse into delerium.
     And her loss of self control?
         You mean an unconscious
         burst of pent-up antipathy?
         But everyone has that.

Is that why the innate
ability is so high?
        Yes...What did the Commander
        call those girls again?
        It's probably higher than
        they are.
Then it's an instantaneous
jump in numerical value.
        But, we can't use her as
        a test subject in front
        of Erich.
It's a pity we can't manage it...
since there is so much potential.

 We'll leave you to
 the bureau.
 
 Stay at your residence
 until further notice.
 
 Don't worry!
 You have power worthy
 of the chosen one's.
 
 It's those weak people's
 fault for not being able
 to withstand your powers.
 
Please!
Stop it!

Renk
"Don't!
Anymore 'Drive' and you'll
waste your mind!!"

Vance
"I don't care! I'm already
messed up as it is!!"

Elly
"Stop this now, Vance.
...I'll handle it."

Fei vs Elly - file15
————————————————————————————

Fei
"...That voice!?
...Elly?
Elly, is that you?!?"

Elly
"Fei...
What're you doing? You
shouldn't be here!"

Fei
"Elly!?
Your face...!?
What's wrong?
Don't tell me you're
using that personality-
changing drug
that Bart told us
about!?"

Elly
"It has nothing to do
with you.
And would you quit
trying to be so
friendly!"

Broyer
"Wow!
Did you see that?!"

Renk
"Those were Aerods!"

Vance
"Aerods?"

Helmholz
"Animum Ether Response-
Offensive Drones...
Commonly known as
Aerods...
Within Gebler, there
are only a handful of
people capable of
using them...
From what I hear,
it should only be
people from the
Elements Class."

Stratski
"B, but isn't it like,
a side effect of the
'Drive'?
It's no big deal,
right...?"

Renk
"...No, the Drive can
only draw upon the
potential that already
exists in her.
Your looking at...
the real thing boys!"

Fei
"Elly, stop it!
Why must we
fight!?"

Elly
"Why? It's obvious.
It's divine
providence!
We are the chosen
people, the Abel...
Our purpose of existence
is to subordinate
the earth dwelling
'Lambs'.
...Those who stand
in our way must be
eliminated!"

Fei
"Elly,
snap out of it!
Your emotions are
being controlled
by the drug!"

Elly
"This is my true nature!
There is no other!"

Fei
"That's a lie!
You once felt
responsible,
blaming yourself for
causing the incident
in Lahan by landing
there.
You were considerate
of me when I was
troubled...
The real you would
never say anything
like that!!"

Elly
"You talk as if you
would know... Yet
you know nothing!"

Elly
"Hahaha! Writhe!
Dance!! Die and rot in
obscurity here!"

Fei
"...Argh!
Elly...
Must I fight you!?"

Elly
"It looks like
it's over for
you.
I'll put you out
of your misery
now!"

Elly
"Fear not!
In return for treating
me so kindly, I will
kill you painlessly.
Farewell, Fei..."

Elly
"Uhh!...
Aagh... Ah...
M, my head..."

Fei
"...What happened?
There's something
wrong with Elly.
I can probably
stop her now!!"

Fei
"Elly!
Wake up and
snap out of it!"

Elly
"Ugh!... Silence!
Impertinent fool!
I will not listen
to a Lamb..."

Elly
"!!
That's...not...true...
I... No...I...don't
want this... Guh!"

Fei
"Are you okay!? Elly!
What!?
Are the effects of
the drug wearing
off?"

Elly
"Uuahh!"

Fei
"Is that it? Elly!
Is that what's
happening!?"

Elly
"Sh, shut up!
I've no need for
outward appearances
of compassion.
...I, I, ... erh
F...Fe...i..."

Elly
"H, hel...p...
Th, this... isn't...
This isn't... me..."

Fei
"Hang in there, Elly!
Don't let go of your
true self!"

Elly
"No---!"

Elly
"Noooooo!!"

Fei
"Elly!!"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Elly, why...?"

Elly
"I warned you...
I said the next time we met
we'd be...enemies."

Fei
"But, there's no reason for
you to do this to yourself
just so you can fight.
There's no reason for you
and I to fight...
None at all."

Elly
"There...was no other
choice..."

Elly
"I'm a Solaris officer...
I can't turn my back on
my unit, the mission..."

Fei
"Why did you have to use
the 'Drive'?"

Elly
"I didn't want to...
When I use it, I change.
I feel like I'm dominated
by some unknown power
that I never wanted...
There's a power in me I
don't want to admit.
But...I want to
protect my allies...
So, I had no choice but to
use...the 'Drive'."

Fei
"...Elly, you're
the same as me."

Elly
"The same?
...Probably.
I felt I knew you ever
since I first met you...
Probably because our
problems were so similar."

Fei
"I'm here for you.
It may not be much,
but at least I can
relate to how you
feel, Elly."

Elly
"What?
Are you saying we lick
each other's wounds?"

Fei
"No, that's not...
Well, I guess I am...
Sorry..."

Elly
"...I'm sorry.
I'm not being fair,
am I...?"

Fei
"No, I'm just
pessimistic
sometimes.
But...even so, it's
better than worrying
about it by yourself."

Elly
"Fei..."

Fei
"You won't change
your mind...?"

Elly
"Please, don't look so
sad. I have no choice.
It is my only home..."

Fei
"...I have to go.
My 'friends' are
waiting for me."

Fei
"If you can, get out
of the army, Elly...
That look doesn't
suit you at all."
