"Oh no!"

Broken Silence - Blackmoon Forest - Rankar Fight - file9

Fei
"Elly!
Are you alright?!
Darn!
She's unconscious!"

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Fe~i!"

Citan
"Fei! I have been
searching for you!
Here, You can use this!"

Fei
"Hey! Hold on a second!
To tell me I can use
it is one thing..."

Fei
"Elly...
Damn it!"

Fei
"Doc.
I have a favor to ask!
I will defeat this
monster!
But, if it looks like
I'll go out of control
like last time,
then shoot me!"

Citan
"Fei...
Let us pray that
that won't happen!"

Broken Silence - Blackmoon Forest - Post Rankar Fight
————————————————————————————

Citan
"Fei!
Are you alright?"

Fei
"Yeah...I guess so."

Citan
"That fight with the
Rankar was remarkable.
An ordinary Gear could
not defeat that monster.
And you certainly keep
yourself in good shape..."

Fei
"Why did you bring
this here, doc?"

Citan
"This...?
You mean Weltall?"

Fei
"...Weltall?
This is the Gear that
destroyed our village.
Why did you bother
bringing it here?
I never want to see
another Gear again..."

Citan
"I understand how
you must feel...
But, in order to
protect yourself
you need a certain
degree of strength.
Even more since we
are being pursued."

Fei
"I agree that a certain
degree of strength is
needed for self-defense.
And if it weren't for this
Gear here, Elly and I'd be
in that Rankar's stomach
right now...
But its power goes beyond
what is necessary. Does
one really need the power
to destroy everything?"

Citan
"..."

Fei
"I don't need that
kind of power...
I just hate Gears."

Citan
"Fei, using power or being
used by power...is that not
a problem of the heart...?
If humans do not use their
power for wrong it can be
a good thing...I believe
such power can help us.
In that respect, I know
you will be fine.
It sure helped you out
this time.
Am I right?"

Fei
"I want to believe that.
But something is holding
me back. This Gear..."

Fei
"Well, whatever...
At least Elly is
safe now."

Citan
"She seems to
have come to."

Elly
"Huh...?"

Citan
"I am Citan...
a friend of Fei's.
You almost did not make it.
If Fei had not have helped
you, I hate to think what
may have happened.
But I was not too pleased
with his rashness in trying
to take on that Rankar
with just his bare fists."

Elly
"Bare fists?"

Citan
"Well, I am glad that you
were able to find a use
for what I brought you."

Elly
"!!"

Citan
"Let us just say we are
borrowing what the Kislev
army left behind..."

Elly
"...Oh."

Elly
"Thank you, Fei.
This makes twice."

Fei
"Don't mention it.
I'll just put it
on your tab."

Citan
"It is getting dark.
Let us make camp now and
start out early tomorrow.
The both of you look tired
and I need to make some
repairs on our friend
here..."

Broken Silence - Blackmoon Forest night by campfire - 0658

Citan
"It is no use. The knee
actuator and bypass
circuit are both ruined.
The actuator can be fixed,
but the circuit needs 
to be replaced..."

Citan
"Oh, having trouble
sleeping there?"

Elly
"Yeah..."

Citan
"I imagine you would.
You have had quite a day."

Citan
"This is the machine Fei
used when the village was
attacked.
There was another machine
left sitting on the
outskirts of the village...
Nil bayer dars legus?
(It was yours, right?)"

!

Citan
"Just as I thought...
The missing pilot from the
Gear that made an emergency
landing in Lahan...
...and the mysterious woman
found wandering lost in the
forest...are actually one
and the same person.
Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the military...
Am I correct?"

Elly
"How...?
Who are you?"

Citan
"I checked the ID tags of
of the soldiers who died
in the attack on Lahan...
The design on their tags
and the design on your
uniform there is the same."

!

Citan
"Do not worry, they were
given proper burials.
But, they may not have
been too pleased to die
in a foreign land."

Elly
"...Maybe."

Citan
"Does Fei know 
about you?"

Elly
"I don't think he
has realized yet."

Citan
"Most likely...
Fei knows nothing of the
world outside of Lahan."

Elly
"I see...
So how come..."

Citan
"...In any case, it is best
if we do not pry into each
other's pasts anymore."

Elly
"But..."

Citan
"Let us just say that I
know a little more about
the world than most do."

Citan
"Anyway, Elly...
I have a favor I must
beg you to do..."

Elly
"...What is it?"

Citan
"Go straight ahead and
you will come to a road.
Then just keep going...
Would you please leave us
while Fei is still asleep?"

!?

Citan
"Unfortunate things keep
happening around Fei.
I would like to protect
him if possible...
I do not want him caught
up in any vain struggles.
I am also saying this for
your benefit.
Elly, you do not belong
here.
Go back to your family."

Elly
"Um...I..."

Citan
"Do not worry.
I will not tell Fei what
your true identity is.
I will...just tell him
you went to meet up
with your family..."

Elly
"No, it is not that!
I did something
terrible to him...
So...I want to...
apologize."

Citan
"Something terrible?"

Elly
"Fei told me it was
our fault your village
was destroyed.
Fei kept saying...
 'if only they
  hadn't come...'
Then, I called Fei a
coward because he was
trying to escape from
the responsibility...
But in fact it was
me who was trying to
escape from taking
the blame..."

Elly
"If I hadn't crash-landed
there, they would all still
be living peacefully now.
All those innocent people
wouldn't have been caught
up in that tragedy.
But I accused Fei..."

Citan
"You are a rarity. I did
not expect your people
would ever think like that.
To your people, surface
dwellers are nothing more
than domesticated animals,
are they not...?"

Elly
"'The Shepherds, -Abel-,
  took control over the
  surface dwelling -Lambs-
  ...possessing the right
  to give life and death
  unto them as they see
  fit...'"

Citan
"Exactly. Yet you seem to
feel responsiblity toward
Fei and the villagers.
Why is that?"

Elly
"I don't know myself...
At Jugend I was taught
that surface dwellers
were stupid and base...
...And that is why we
have to control them...
But..."

Citan
"But upon meeting Fei,
something about him made
you feel differently?"

Elly
"Yes. He's no different
than we are...in fact he
seemed more powerful.
He possesses something...
...something we don't.
He also risked his life
to save me...twice."

Citan
"Most of your people
would feel ashamed at
receiving such an act.
Yet, you are grateful
to Fei...?"

Elly
"It's probably because of
my father. He had an open
mind to surface dwellers.
My nanny was...a surface
dweller. No one knew about
her though...
Besides...
I am the same as Fei..."

Citan
"The same?"

Elly
"No, nothing. 
Nevermind..."

Citan
"Hmm. I think I understand.
I am sorry. After just
saying we should not pry...
It is my nature, you know?
My wife says I am too
persistent and that I
talk too much.
But, personally, I do not
think I talk too much."

Citan
"It is probably best
if you return home
to your country.
You really should
not be here."

Elly
"I'll return to
headquarters.
But then what..."

Citan
"You are worried..."

Elly
"Yes..."

Citan
"Worrying is natural...
 'Even I used to worry
  once too, you know!?'"

Elly
"Oh, Citan..."

Citan
"Anyway, let me handle
what to tell Fei...
You had better go now."
