Tears for Fears - Solaris Coded Hallway Door - 1738
————————————————————————————

Fei
"Huh?
This one won't
open either."

Citan
"This way."

Elly
(Why...is the
deactivation code for the
door lock known?)

Fei
"Doc, wait..."

Fei
"What's this facility for?"

Citan
"This place was not meant
to be seen since the
origin of time.
This facility centers
around the Emperor and
the Ministry's longevity
experiments."

Fei
"The origin of time?"

Citan
"Yes...10,000 years ago.
Beings called humans were
born here.
The first were the Emperor
and the Ministry's elders.

Elly
"How could a human...
live 10,000 years...?"

Citan
"Now only the Emperor is
left. His destiny is to
never die.
However, the Ministry is
different.
Once, during the
Diabolos Invasion...
the Ministry elders died
losing their bodies.
Now, the Solaris governing
Ministry exists as data in
memory banks.
Each of their personalities
are bits of data."

Fei
"It's the data on the
memory bank?"

Citan
"Having neither flesh nor
souls they are just binary
numbers.
They both exist and do not
exist at the same time..."

Citan
"After the Fall, wanting
to resurrect their bodies,
and create a worthy vessel,
they transferred a research
facility that was once the
Soylent System on the land
to Etrenank.
Eventually the facility was
no longer only for the
Emperor's life and the
Ministry's resurrection,
but it began producing food
and drugs with additives
that controlled the public.
The memory cube Fei and
them were using was meant
for obtaining living data.
Of course, the 'Ethos' also
sent various data to help."

Fei
"That means we were
living for those elderly
people of Gazel?"

Citan
"Yes."

Elly
"They're transferring
and taking living data
via memory cubes to the
Ministry so they can use
them to resurrect their
bodies!?"

Citan
"Yes."

Fei
"You mean those mutants
getting disassembled at
that factory were too?"

Citan
"Basically, they wish to
reuse the useless dregs."

Fei
"That's horrid...
How could they..."

Elly
"Hold on, Fei!
Something's not right!"

Elly
"Citan, 
how would you know that?
Not even the government
or the army know such
things!"

Fei
"What?"

Elly
"Come to think of it, it
seems like we took the long
way here on purpose.
There must've been a faster
way to Bart and them.
Also, the route to get to
this block can't even be
downloaded on the map.
So how did we know what
streets we were on?"

Fei
"Doc, didn't you also
find out..."

Elly
"That's impossible.
First of all, that
partition we took to get
into this block.
That panel was displayed
to be a P4 facility.
Even a high ranking
officer of Solaris
can't get in here.
You think they'd
leave a facility like
that unlocked and open?"

Elly
"And you could open it?
Who exactly are you?"

Fei
"Hey wait a minute.
It could've been luck."

Elly
"Something's wrong!
You were able to get into
Solaris under martial law,
sneak into the palace, get
through a P4 level door,
and even learn the purpose
of the P4 facility...
How is that possible?"

Elly
"Even father. I'm sure it
was possible you were in
Solaris then."

Elly
"Even Jessie, who was also
in Solaris then,
didn't know the motive
behind the M Project.
So Citan, why do you know?
You know even more details
than Maria...something's
not right...I know it."

Fei
"Elly, uh, uhmm..."

Elly
"I'm not done!"

Elly
"I should've noticed
sooner. Citan...
Who are you?"

Fei
"Wh, what...!"

Fei
"Hey, you okay?
Elly. Elly...?"

"What is this!?
Why are you showing 
me this!?
Who!? 
Who did this!?
Elly!
Doc!
Where are you!?
Where..."

You brought about this
spectacle.

That voice is the one
which haunts you...

Cursed, untouchable one...

Oh god's beloved child,
those who prevent our
prayers...

Get...

Destroy...

Burn with god's fire...

Fei
"Wha...?"

Fei
"Doc!?
Th, these guys?
What is this!?"

Fei
"Bart!?"

Fei
"Billy!"

Fei
"Doc!!
What's going on!?
What are you all...?
Doc! Answer me!"

Elder (*???*)
"One of the Solaris
Guardian Angels is
here, Hyuga Ricdeau.

Elder (*???*)
"This man is Cain...
Receiving the orders from
the one known as Emperor,
You've entered his realm,
and have been under his 
continued supervision..."

Fei
"Solaris Guardian Angel?
Monitoring me?"

Elder (*???*)
"Oh yes.
We've guided Solaris and
even selected the
'Animus' which have been
drawn to you.
And guided you here to
Solaris."

Elder (*???*)
"The 'Animus' is needed for
our resurrection...
These are our bodies...
This what we possess."

Elder (*???*)
"Yes, this is the only
reason we exist..."

Fei
"The bodies of Bart and
the others belong to you?
Is that true!?
Doc!
What they are saying?"

Elder (*???*)
"Why so apprehensive?
Is it that you were sold
out by one you trusted?"

Fei
"I'm not talking to you
guys! Doc, answer me!"

Citan
"3 years..."

Fei
"?"

Citan
"For three years I have
been by your side.
I had to determine whether
you were going to be our
enemy or not..."

Fei
"...Revenge?"

Elder (*Blue 1*???)
"Yes, the enemy.
Your existence is a threat
to us..."

Elder (*Red 2*???)
"It was necessary to keep
an eye on you."

Elder (*Blue 4*???)
"The one who ordered you to
be watched was Cain..."

Elder (*Blue 1*???)
"We were planning on the
maturation of the 'Animus',
and your termination.
We also sent Hyuga to you."

Elder (*Blue 2*???)
"However, every attempt to
terminate you has failed...
Because of that good for
nothing trash..."

Elder (*Blue 1*???)
"Even so, we now possess
'Animus'.
Hyuga has fulfilled his
duties well."

Fei
"Is... that it...?
You were in with these
guys...
That's why you,
everyone..."

Fei
"Why!
You've had your way all
this time with us land
dwellers!
You already own the world!
What more do you want?"

Elder
"You must know by now that
we plan to resurrect god."

Elder
"God will awaken from his
long slumber after man has
populated the land...
Then, Mahanon too will
awaken..."

Fei
"Aerial Paradise Mahanon?
The place fell to earth..."

Elder
"Paradise...
Hah hah hah.
That may be a proper
description...
Our ark...
In the center block lord
'Mahanon' is sealed in.
That is the source of god's
wisdom...A paradise of
knowledge..."

Elder
"Using that knowledge, we
will resurrect the awakened
god and build our 'ark'
to take us both into the
great universe."

Elder
"The construction of
our ark...
To reign over god's
forces in this great
universe...
The creation of the angel
'Malakh'. The M Project was
for that very purpose..."

Fei
"What do you mean!?"

Elder
"We are orphans in this
universe.
We were thrown away onto
this planet in
solitude along with god."

Elder
"We humans were not born
on this planet.
Long ago, we came here from
another heavenly body. We
are beings from an alien
planet."

Fei
"That's ridiculous!?"

Elder
"This is true.
You have seen the various
regions of this world.
Why do you think there are
no records of humans 
before 10,000 years ago..."

Fei
"...!?"

Elder
"This is the will of god.
The god's revival has been 
fated since before the 
time before genesis..."

Elder
"We will be one with god.
Attaining a new 'Animus'...
We will once again return
to the starry skies..."

Elder
"That is the meaning
of our existence."

Elder
"That is our supreme
objective."

Fei
"...So you're not
planning on using
Solaris'
power to dominate
the world?"

Elder
"Of course.
What meaning is there in
having control of a planet
as insignificant as this?
God has given us the right
to rule over the universe."

Elder
"Yes.
Only we, who do not carry
impure blood, have the right
to a pardon..."

Elder
"So, we will resurrect god."

Elder
"It's been an eternity
since our exile from
paradise.
If the time of god's 
revival does not come,
we will have to
follow the path to
destruction. But..."

Elder
"Having attained 'Animus',
our resurrection is near...
Next is god's resurrection"

Fei
"Krelian!?"

Krelian
"This one only waits for
the awakening..."

Fei
"Elly!!?"

Elly
"Where am I...?"

Krelian
"I've looked into your
records."

Elly
"K, Krelian...Commander?"

Krelian
"Elhaym Van Houten.
That incident at the Jugend
one year ago...
Case 102. The release of
your latent powers from
that systematic...
...administration of mental
enhancment drugs.
In that instant, your Ether
value had increased beyond
400.
And in that moment, 2
were critically wounded
and 3 required recycling.
Am I right?"

Elly
"Please, stop!"

Krelian
"But, this record is wrong.
This wasn't the usual
uncontrollable mental
side effects."

Elly
"...?"

Krelian
"This was caused by the
'awakening of your other
inner self'."

Elly
"My other self...?"

Elly
"Where's Fei? Where is
everyone...?"

Krelian
"They will be used as an
offering for the...
...resurrection of the
Gazel Ministry.
The same fate awaits that
girl, the artificial
organism.
I've already taken enough
samples from her.
I'm already well into the
fourth stage of my plan.
All I need now is the
final factor.
Hence, your friends are
no longer of any use to
me. They're worthless.
But, you are different."

Elly
"You're planning on sending
them to the same fate as...
...those people in that
research facility!
Doing all this for your
own selfish ambitions...
Do you know what you're
doing!?
People playing with other
people's lives. That's
deplorable!"

Krelian
"I see...
So you've seen the
research facility.
Presently, the Solaris
researchers are working
on genetic engineering
down there.
It's just a nest for fools
who've learned the
despicable pleasure of...
...playing with their own
organic creations. They
seek only serendipity and
inhumanity.
That is not my place.
I specialize in
molecular engineering...
Nanotechnology."

Krelian
"Do you know what this is?
A nanomachine...a molecular
machine.
This is the assembler,
which is one of those
nanomachine machines.
It can break down molecules
and atoms and reconstruct
it into anything.
Each of these spheres are
equivalent to an atom.
Until recently, we were
only able to produce...
...materials which were
several times the
size of this.
Thanks to that girl, the
one we obtained from the
ruins of the Zeboim
civilization,
we are now able to make it
this compact and elaborate.
To think that such a
mechanism was created 4000
years ago. It's quite
astonishing.
Up until we discovered
this, the work was rather
crude.
The best we could possibly
do until now was to apply
amino acid solutions to
wounded areas for...
...amelioration or to seal
up any peculiar abilities.
I'm sure you've had some
exposure to genetics when
you were in the Jugend.
Each type of those enzymes
inside the DNA...are also
molecular machines that
were created by nature.
That is, if we are indeed
the progeny of the very
first organism."

Elly
"What do you think of
accomplishing by using that
molecular machine?
What connection do I have
with it?"

Krelian
"Although the nanomachines
up until now could
recombine DNA...
...they couldn't uncover
any information in the
intron which are located
in the replacements...
...of the double helix.
However, the newer
nanomachines easily
discovered this data.
Data that originally
'should not have existed'.
And we are about to see the
results of that."

Krelian
"Hmm, according to the
tranferred record, it
depicts...
...a similar wave
frequency as expected."

Krelian
"And...yes, the Urobolus
Ring...!
That is it, isn't it...?
Miang, and Lacan's
actions...
This explains everything."

Krelian
"Elhaym...
You were the 'mother'..."

Elly
"Mother...?"

Krelian
"Yes.
This is what your genetic
exon looked like before
replacement...
This is the conceptualized
form of the intron which
carries information that
isn't supposed to exist.
Observe. This is the
Urobulos Ring which
contains 'intron
information' which only...
...exists in 'certain
people'. Urobolus...if
we were to anatomize such
a thing...
Wouldn't you be interested
in what type of information
it would have to offer us?"

Elly
"..."

Krelian
"Elhaym, you are beautiful.
When I look at you, I
appreciate the artistic
aspect of the human form,
its elaborateness...
I can't help but feel the
importance of that.
As if my molecular machine
is unworthy of you.
You haven't changed
'since then'.
Just like the 'other one',
Lacan..."

Fei
"Ugh..."

Citan
"Are you conscious?"

Fei
"Doc... (*???line cuts here*)
Th, this...!?"

Citan
"It is impossible to move.
This machine has physically
cut your nerve signals.
You will not be able to
lift a finger regardless
of what your minds says."

Fei
"What're you gonna do to
me? To Bart and them?
Where is Elly?"

Citan
"Do not worry...
They have their roles...
you have yours.
I simply investigate."

Fei
"Damnit...
This...
What was I..."

Citan
"So the battle has been
fought...you say?
That was discussed earlier
by the Ministry..."

Fei
"Godammit!
We weren't born to be used
by them!
We didn't come all the way
to Solaris for that!
I, we, everyone...we just
want to make a place where
we can belong...
That's what we were
fighting for...
But now..."

Citan
"It is much easier to be
given a place to belong
than to make one yourself.
You do not even
understand a simple
concept like that?"

Fei
"Only the true...!"

Citan
"Childish ideals pale when
placed before reality.
But actually many are
satisfied with that.
Being given one's place,
frees one from any risks.
Misfortunes may be blamed
on others.
Do you know why people can
not exist alone but only
under some bigger concept
such as a group or country?
People need a place to go
to be themselves...
The more stable it is the
more effective it is."

Citan
"The Ministry gives them
such a place.
Under total surveilance,
there is no need to bear
the risk of maintaining 
one's own individuality.
They simply live under the
delusion of being an
'individual'. What could
be easier?
Facts are facts so let's
just accept them. It will
be easier for all of us.
Resistance is futile. It
only makes things painful."

Fei
"I... I..."

Citan
"Do you still intend to
do something about it?
Look at yourself...
What do you think you could
possibly do at this stage?
You cannot move.
You could not even protect
your friends who fought
with you, when they needed
you.
You could not even protect
the most important person
in your life, Elly."

Fei
"Stop! Please!"

Citan
"You can do nothing."

Fei
"Quit... it..."

Citan
"Now, we may take our
time and talk... Id..."

It's your mistake!"

Bart isn't lying,
Citan is the one
who helped us!"

Fei
"Billy!?..."

Bart
"Hmph...
If Billy says it you 
listen..."

Bart
"Listen very carefully!
That Limiter is implanted
in our bodies.
Right now,
this research facility
is the only place where
we can get them removed!
Citan misled Krelian and
the other guys and brought
us in here to remove the
Limiter!"

Fei
"What...
But doc was just...
Is that true?"

Bart
"Yeah!"

Fei
"Doc?"

Citan
"That is not the only
reason why I brought
you here.
Those who want to
become independent
from Solaris
must know the actual
situation and
its true form.
Who is doing what and why."

Citan
"Ostensibly,
I received a covert
order from the Emperor
to contact the body
wanted by the Ministry
and send the data...
and if possible bring
the body back.
That was my duty.
As a result, I had no
choice but to deceive you.
Please forgive me."

Fei
"I see how it is..."

Citan
"Besides,
I myself had
a matter that had be
verified in this
facility..."

Fei
"For sure?"

Citan
"I'll tell you that after
we escape from here.
It is something you must
know."

Fei
"...?"

Bart
"By the way, Citan.
You did remove Fei's
Limiter, didn't you?"

Citan
"...What?"
Y...yes, of course...
That is..."

Bart
"Alright then. 
Let's get out of here!"

Fei
"Wait!
What happened to Elly?
Weren't you with her?"

Citan
"Elly was taken to
Krelian's research lab.
It could not be stopped.
I am sorry."

Fei
"Why only Elly...?"

Citan
"I do not know...
But one thing bothers
me...When Krelian took
Elly,
I had a chance to acquire
Elly's cellular
information.
I analyzed it and found
something very interesting
...Excuse me, I mean...
unusual.
There is no 
Limiter implanted in her."

Billy
"There's no Limiter?
Isn't that because Elly is 
from Solaris?"

Citan
"Even Solaris citizens
have a Limiter implanted
when they are born.
There are exceptions for
certain people like myself
and Ramsus,
whose Limiters can be
removed later on through
the treatment such as the
one I did for Bart.
But you must
have permission from the
Ministry to do so."

Fei
"Is that why...Elly...?"

Citan
"There must be more to it
than that. I don't know
the reason,
but Krelian is so
absorbed by her data."

Bart
"I don't care what the
reason is! For now,
let's help Elly and
get out of here fast!"

Billy
"You're right.
If we mess up here,
I put those guys who went
to help Elly's parents in
danger."

Billy
"Citan, we're going to
Krelian's private
research lab as planned.
We'll meet up at
the rendezvous point."

Fei
"What about doc...?"

Citan
"There is still something
left to be done. I will go
destroy the last gate."

Fei
"Doc!
A sword...?"

Citan
"...Yes.
Yui gave it to me as
I was leaving.
I used to use it before
I met her. For a long time
I vowed not to use it for
killing though.
But now is not the time to
contemplate morals. It is
not fair for me to be the
only 'innocent' one."

Fei
"...I see...
...But..."

Citan
"Yes?"

Fei
"You're always so
mischievous, doc..."

Citan
"It is in my nature.
I am sorry, forgive me."

Bart
"Yo! Citan!
Let me handle Fei and
Elly's situation!
Now that the Limiter is
removed, Solaris doesn't
stand a chance!"

Citan
"Oh, yes! By the way, young
one, about the effects of
removing the Limiter...
The results will not show
up that quickly. Already
your physical Limiters have
been removed naturally.
The part I have removed is
the psychological section.
That is...the subconscious
fear and veneration for the
Ministry and the emperor
have been removed.
