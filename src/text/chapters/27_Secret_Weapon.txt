Fei
"...First we save the
empire, now we're being
chased by them"

Citan
"We cannot make a wrong
move with security
this tight..."

Fei
"Hammer's our only
hope...He's awfully late
though."

Fei
"Looks like Hammer's
here."

Hammer
"Bro, Citan!
I got the key info that
should help us get outta
the capital!"

Fei
"So what's the info?"

Hammer
"The empire's new
super airship,
...'Goliath'.
This is it, bro."

Citan
"The empire's new
creation...the super
airship 'Goliath'?"

Elly
"...Super airship.
Is it that big?"

Hammer
"Tsk tsk, it's
beyond big!
!?..."

Elly
"...It's Elly."

Hammer
"!? ...As I said, it's
beyond big, Elly!"

Hammer
"The 'Goliath' is of
extraordinary magnitude!
It's said that the
'Goliath' can even make
a Gear look like a pea.
It's rumored that it
can even decimate the
Aveh capital, Bledavik,
all by itself."

Fei
"By itself, annihilate
Aveh!? It must be a
monstrous battleship."

Hammer
"According to my reliable
sources, it's located
north of Kislev in an
underground dock at some
military facility..."

!?

Elly
"...The military
facility... north of the
capital..."

Fei
"Elly, what's wrong?"

Elly
"I know that facility.
I've talked to you about
it before. The Imperial
facility... 
I infiltrated...I never knew
that something like that
was in the basement..."

Citan
"...Elly, do you think
you still remember...
how you infiltrated
the base?"

Elly
"Yes, Citan."

Elly
"Way north, beyond the
Kislev Imperial capital...
beyond the 'carved out
portion of the mountain 
peak' lies the Imperial
city's military facility."

Fei
"Good, let's take that...
...before the empire
decides to launch a
counter-attack against
Aveh."

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"Oh, yes!
I forgot to tell you
about Master Rico, bro."

Fei
"You've seen him?"

Hammer
"Yeah, and I brought up
our plan to escape from
the capital... Says he
can't help us though."

Fei
"...I see."

Citan
"Fei, he has his own path
he must take. Now...
let us go."

Elly
"...Fei, we must hurry to
Aveh..."

Fei
"Huh? Uh yeah...I know,
Elly. We have to hurry...
If we go through the
front gate we might have
to fight the guards...
Hammer, once we break
through, fall in behind
us."

Hammer
"That's my specialty.
Leave it to me, bro.
And put up a good fight!"

Fei
"Doc, Elly.
Let's go. Our destination
is the imperial military
facility up north."

Hammer
"Ju, just a minute!
There's something I have
to tell Elly."

Elly
"Tell
...me?"

Hammer
"Yes'm!
It'll be real quick."

Hammer
"All right!"

Citan
"...All right?"

Hammer
"Uh, nothing!!"

Hammer
"Good luck in breaking
through the front gate,
bro, and you Citan!"

Nun
You know, she's keeping
that promise she made
with you...... She's in
D Block, so don't forget
to go see her once in a
while.

Hammer
"I gave away all my items
to the people who were
injured by the Aveh attack.
I, I didn't take any money
for it though!
I woulda never done that
before...
Who'd have thought I could
do such a thing?
...Heh. It's probably
because of you, bro."

————————————————————————————

Hammer
"Bro, you wanna buy
something? ...
Just kidding. I'm all
outta items."

Man
They say that flying battleship
crashed in the north-western
area of D Block...
Luckily we escaped a direct hit.
Boy am I thankful it wasn't
near our civilian area!

Woman
The attack by our enemy
kingdom Aveh on our Imperial
capital was really scary!
If that ever happens again,
I'm out of here! Perhaps I
might move to Nisan!

Soldier 1
Argh...damn Aveh.
Because of that attack,
Josephine was crushed
under a chair...

You okay...Josephine?

Oooh...Alright...
alright.

Soldier 2
The attack on the
Empire by Aveh is sure to
start a war...
A mercenary like me can't
make a living without
some conflict.

Kislev and Aveh...
Which one should I suck
the blood from...

Man
I was surprised by the
Aveh attack, but I was
lucky my comrad was from
the mole tribe.

Mole
I'm embarrased...
boss.

Imperial City Guard
"...Hey! Isn't he the guy
in the 'wanted' poster...
perhaps?"

Imperial City Guard 2
"...Yeah, they say that
everyone has two or three
people that look exactly
like them in this world..."

Imperial City Guard 2
"Besides, even if he was
that 'wanted' guy, what
chance would mere guards
like us have against him?
He's the ex-Battling Champ!"

Imperial City Guard
"Let sleeping dogs lie, huh!"

Imperial City Guard 2
"Exactly! So even if we were
to see him here, then we'd 
just pretend that we haven't
seen him, O.K.!"

Imperial City Guard 3
"Hey, that guy! He's the
ex-Champ who broke out of
the arena with his Gear
and is now 'wanted'!"

Imperial City Guard 2
"Are you stupid!?"

Fei
"Damn! We're done for!"
    Run away for now.
    Try to break through!

Fei
"We can't let them catch us.
Let's try running away
for the time being!"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"We've got to give it a try!
Doc! Elly! Let's try and
force our way through here!"

Citan
"... So it is the only
thing we can do, right?"

Elly
"Wait a second!
Do you really intend
to do this?"

Imperial City Guard 2
"Oh no! They're serious!"

Imperial City Guard
"There's no way we can
beat the Champion!!!"

Imperial City Guard 3
"Hahaa! You'll be our
greatest achievement!"

Imperial City Guard 2
"D, didn't I tell
you that..."

Imperial City Guard
"Egads...!"

Imperial City Guard 3
"Oh, our reputation..."

Fei
"Hey, you're...Rico!
What are you doing here?"

Rico
"...I changed my mind. I'll
leave Nortune for a while,
until things calm down.
You plan on seizing the new
mega-battleship 'Goliath'?
Well, I'll give you a hand
...up to the city limits."

Fei
"...
You don't want to fight
together with us?"

Rico
"...Make no mistake here!
I don't intend to become
friends with you guys!"

Rico
"I have something I have 
to do and I have to do it
on my own...!
When we leave the Imperial
capital's precincts, you 
can let me out anywhere
that is convenient, O.K.!"

Fei
"........."

Citan
"Well, at least until we
escape from the city area
we have got a secure ally.
That is good enough for us,
is it not!"

Citan
"Don't you think?"

Elly
"Well... yes...
I suppose so."

Rico
"We have no time to 
dawdle around here!
We better get out of here
before other guards who
heard this scuffle come
causing us trouble!"

Rico
"So our destination is the
'north lands' of the outer
Imperial city area, right!
Then the Kislev Imperial
capital's military
facilities await us!
We had better make haste!"

Hammer
"Muahahah! Hey bro, I
went ahead and opened up
the locks for you.
What? The Gear? Nah, don't
worry about the details.
I'm the information man!
There's nothing outta my
reach.
But hey, there aren't
any enemies though.
Something's suspicious.
Oh yeah, you can
change your party and
even shop.
Need anything?"
    Party change
    Shop
    Nothing

Hammer
"Go get'em. I'll catch
up with you later."

————————————————————————————
-AFTER-???

Hammer
"Looks like some bad
guys are comin' out.
I'll try to help too.
What do you want?"
    Party change
    Shop
    Nothing

Hammer
"Well, good luck. I'll
catch up with you later."
