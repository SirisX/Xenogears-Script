Margie
"Wow!
It's been such a long
time since I left here."

Citan
"Well...
First of all, we should
accompany Marguerite up
to meet the sisters!"

Bart
"...Huh?
What is it old Maison?"

Maison
"Sniff...
Goodness gracious me...!
To think that little Miss
Marguerite was finally
able to return here...
...
It is so awfully moving!"

Bart
"H...hey!
Pull yourself together,
old man!"

Maison
"F...forgive me.
How terribly embarrassing!
I couldn't help it..."

Maison
"I...
I shall go back and give
some instructions to the
men left on the ship.
Please, young master,
go ahead and escort
Miss Marguerite up to
see the sisters.
...Excuse me now."

————————————————————————————

Little Girl
Mr. Pirate!

Will you let me ride
in your ship someday?

Bart
"Hahaha!
Maybe when you get a
little older, kid!"

Little Girl 2
Margie has come back!

Nisan Inn - 0780

Innkeeper
I'm very sorry but
we're all full.
As an apology please
accept this...

 Special Herb Tea!

 Reduced weight a bit 

Come again!

————————————————————————————

Guard 1
Is the rumor that there
are pirates in the Royal
Capital true?

Guard 2
Through a special
arrangement with the town
representatives, we're
getting lodging.

Nisan - 0792

Man
If it isn't my young lord!
I hear you gave them quite
a show this time!

Bart
(Shhh! Keep it down!
My true identity is
supposed to be a secret!
What if a spy from the
Royal Capital snuck in
here and heard you!?)

Man
(Oh... I hadn't
thought about that!)

Bart
"Hello, grandma."

Grandma
Hey, aren't you the
young master?

Hey you!

Shopkeep
Huh?

Huh!

It's Bartholomew!
Are you doing well?

Bart
"Good enough!"

Shopkeep
Don't try to 
overdo it.
Hey, are those your 
friends back there?

Bart
"Yeah.
Fei and Citan."

Shopkeep
Friends of the young master
are friends of ours.
Take your time and 
look around.

Bart
"Thanks."

————————————————————————————

This place has gotten
to be a pain.
My family is fleeing north
to the mountains.
I'm here to buy supplies.

Officer
Young master, the old man
from the Gun Room sent me
here for supplies.
If you want, I can also
get Gear parts you may
need. Just tell me.

Bart
"Whoa, good preparations!
If that's the case, please
get the parts we need."

Nisan - 0792

Old Man
So you're going to make
your move eh, Bartholomew?
But somehow I don't think
that man's just going to
stand by and let you do
as you please though.

Fei
"That man?"

Bart
"He means 'Shakhan'!"

Old Man
Yes.
It's alright to try and
avenge your father...
...but I don't think
things will be that
easy, though!

Bart
"I don't want to
hurt anyone.
I want you to know
I'm always thinking
about that."

Old Man
Do your best!

Nisan Town Hall - 0782
————————————————————————————

Elder 1
How's Bledavik?

Elder 2
It's under martial law so
it's gotten progressively
harder to contact our
agents in the city.
According to the info we
finally got just a while
ago, there's no major
activity.
We think they've found
some reason to attack and
are getting ready now..."

Elder 1
The possiblity exists.

Elder 2
However I've heard that
Shakhan's powerbase in the
capital is erroding away.
He's probably weaker than
we thought.

Elder 3
Anyway, it's happened and
we're committed now.

Elder 1
I feel the same way.

Now that I think about it,
12 years ago...

Elder 4
Ever since the coup d'etat
by Shakhan, there's been
a lot of tension in our
country.
With Marguerite back now, 
I agree that the former
dynasty should be returned
to power.

Woman
Everyone feels the same
but we must look at reality.
Do we have the strength to
do that now?

Now I hear Bartholomew,
the one who brought back
Marguerite, has started
moving around out in the
open. I'm certain Shakhan
is preparing a large army.

Elder 5
Shakhan may be coming
here soon...

... 

Elder 6
What's gonna happen to us
if he captures this area?

Will everyone be killed?

Elder 7
I seriously doubt that.
Even he won't want to risk
provoking any kind of
outrage with the citizens.
Especially in this
situation, he will
definitely want to avoid
putting himself in a
compromising situation.

Elder 2
We should set up a hiding
place just in case...

Maybe there...

Nisan - 0792

Bart
"Please, don't either of
you talk about this in
front of Margie...
She's only just got back
from her long time in
captivity...
I don't want her to have
to worry...
I want her to be happy 
for a little longer."

Citan
"You should not be overly
worried yourself!
You have just got to think
about what is best for the
future of this land...
What is done is done!
You only did what you
believed was right...
Put the past behind you."

Bart
"Huh...
I'm alright!"

————————————————————————————

Old Man
I've had enough troubles.
I just want to live life
peacefully.

Nun 1
Neither of us serve
heaven within the
Nisan cathedral...
But we pray here daily,
as ones who have lived
here for many years.

Nun 2
The town representatives
have been in discussion
at the assembly hall
since this morning.

I hear they're talking
about a plan to deal with
the troops from Aveh.
Some of them think the
return of Margie is a
nuisance.

Nun 1
I can understand why
everyone is worried.
But shouldn't we be counting
our blessings that the Great
Mother resides in Nisan...?

————————————————————————————
Nisan Studio - 0788
————————————————————————————

Artist
...Sorry, but please
don't talk to me now.
Yesterday morning's view
from the lake.
I'm remembering the
sensation of that light.

Man
Actually Nisan is a
pretty popular place
among artists.
Part of the reason is the
scenery but it's mostly
because of the portrait
of the Great Mother that
is said to be in the
cathedral.
Unfortunately, the public
is not permitted to go
see it.

————————————————————————————
???

No...something's not right.

...I forgot.

Oh...I'm remebering.

I got it!

I was thinking of putting
the arrival of a new era
into a picture.

Fei
(Paint brushes...
I haven't touched them
since I left the village.)

Hm?...Are you
an artist too?

Fei
"Ah...no..."

Oh...pictures
are great.

Fei
"Oh...
Oh, really..."

————————————————————————————
Nisan - 0792

Old Man
It does the heart good
to see the innocent
play of children.

Children
I'll get you!

I'm gonna get you!

Outta the way,
outta the way!

Outta the way!
Outta the way!

Woman
Oh, so you're the ones?
Everyone in town is
talking about you!
Something about the
Great Mother returning...
Since they call her the
Great Mother she must
be really old and frail!

Margie
"These are the people
who took care of me
when I was small."

Nun
I'm so glad you're safe!

Elder
Oh, Bart!
I'm glad you're well.

Old Man
The people at the hidden
port contacted us just
before you came into town.

I've already contacted the
monastery.
Please take Margie up
there as soon as possible.
She'll be so happy...
not to mention the sisters!

Margie
"I must hurry and
see the sisters."

————————————————————————————
???

I've already contacted
the monastery.
Go to them quickly and
show them you're alright.
I'm sure they'll be
happy to see you!

Welcome back!

This road leads
to the cathedral.

————————————————————————————
Nisan Cathedral - 0796

Margie!

Margie!

Margie
"I'm back, everyone!"

Oh, Margie...
We're so glad you're safe...

Margie
"Yes, it is all thanks
to Bart and his men."

We just received word...
So we were singing a
hymn of praise and joy.
We're so happy...
Oh, what a relief!

Sister Agnes
"Welcome back, Margie.
We had faith that you and
your cousin Bart would one
day return safely...
We and your other friends
have been waiting for you."

Margie
"Sister Agnes!"

Sister Agnes
"Unfortunately, your
mother and the blessed
Royal Mother..."

Margie
"I know, Sister Agnes...
I heard about it at
the Royal Capital..."

Margie
"...But at least I
have made it back...
I'll never go anywhere,
or leave you from now on!
I won't make you all worry
anymore...ever again!"

Sister Agnes
"Bless you my dear..."

Margie
"Sister Agnes, this just
isn't like you at all!
Here I am back
safe and sound.
Can't you rebuke
me just a little,
for old time's sake?"

Sister Agnes
"Ha...
I'm sorry...
But I'm just so
happy that I cannot
help but..."

"Sister..."

Sister Agnes
"...There is no reason
to be so solemnly quiet..."

Margie
"...Thank you,
and bless you all!"

Margie
"Oh, yes, Sister...
May I go upstairs?
It's been oh so long,
so I want to have a look
around up there too."

Sister Agnes
"Oh, but of course, dear!
Don't even think of holding
back from anything...
Except for one thing...
Never stay away so long
like that again."

Margie
"Ha, ha!
I knew you'd say that.
Now that's the Agnes
I know!'

"Margie, I am so glad."

Bart
"It's been a while since
the last time I was here."

Bart
"...?
Something wrong, Margie?"

Margie
"...Nothing.
It's just..."

Margie
"I guess I got a 
little emotional...
Heh, heh, heh..."

Bart
"..."

Bart
"Anyhow, take it
easy for a while.
...You've put up
with enough, okay."

Margie
"...If you are trying to
make me cry, you'll fail."

Margie
"Oh yes!
I'll show Fei and Citan
around our cathedral...
Follow me!"

Citan
"What a strong
girl she is...
It is obvious that she
really wants to just
break down and cry..."

Bart
"Yeah, you're right...
That's just the way
she has always been.
For all her talk, she
understands her position
well...
Maybe there are a few
things I could learn
from her too."

————————————————————————————

Margie
"We go up to the gallery
on the second floor from
here..."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"...How magnificent!"

Margie
"If we ever got scolded
for pranks as kids, Bart
and I used to hide here."

Bart
"Hey, stop telling
those old stories.
It's embarrassing!"

Margie
"But to me, Bart hasn't
changed much since then."

Bart
"What!?
You mean that you think
I'm still a kid!?"

Margie
"I like the view from
here the best."

Citan
"Yes, this is
breathtaking!"

Citan
"Light from outside shining
through the stained glass
of the cathedral's front...
What a brilliant piece of
artistry this is."

Margie
"Did you notice that the
two great angels only
have one wing each...?"

   According to a legend
  handed down in Nisan...
  God could have created
    humans perfectly...
But then, humans would not
 have helped each other...
So that is what these great
   single-winged angels
       symbolizes...
 In order to fly, they are
 dependent on one another.

Citan
"Ah, so that is the
reason for it.
I see...
On further inspection,
the left angel looks
somewhat masculine...
...while the right one
looks somewhat feminine."

Citan
"Now that is an unusual
feature, is it not?"

Citan
"Usually these depictions
are not gender-specific.
But these angels are
clearly distinguishable as
having opposing genders."

Citan
"And the space between
them is the path from
where god advents..."

Citan
"Or could it be the
path leading to god?
Well...I do not know,
it could be either,
or even both."

Citan
"...Now I see!"

Citan
"This all coincides with
the teachings of Nisan."

Margie
"Ha, ha, ha!
Why Doctor Citan Uzuki!
You are an amusing fellow!"

Citan
"Oh!
Excuse me.
It is a habit of mine..."

Fei
"The doc knows a lot
about a lot of things...
Sometimes I can't even
understand what he's
talking about..."

Bart
"...Hah!
Forcing them to fly
together...?
It would be less
bothersome if they
could fly on their own,
don't you think, Fei?"

Margie
"Bart!
You miss the deeper meaning
and beauty of it!"

Margie
"Someday I wish I could
be of help to someone
like that..."

Margie
"Oh, we haven't visited
the 'Room of Sophia' yet,
have we?
You're really supposed to
go through some procedures
before you can see it...
But this time I think it
will be alright if I make
a special exception."

Fei
"Sophia?"

Margie
"Yes, Sophia.
She is revered as the
founding mother of the
Nisan nation...
and the founder of the
Nisan religion who set
forth its teachings.
There is a special
room upstairs that
has a portrait of
Mother Sophia in it."

Citan
"I would definitely like
to view that! Fei, let us
go have a look at it!

————————————————————————————
Nisan Cathedral - Sophia Room - 0802
————————————————————————————

Citan
"Oh my...
What an exquisite portrait!
And the beautiful young
lady portrayed is quite
beyond comparison too..."

Citan
"What is more...
this looks rather
familiar...!"

Citan
"What do you think, Fei?"

Fei
"Yes, I was just thinking
the same thing.
The hair is a different
color, but the atmosphere
or personality about her
is exactly the same."

Citan
"What? 
Hair color?
What do you mean?"

Fei
"What do I mean?
Look...!
It's the girl I met
in the forest..."

Fei
"It's Elly! I mean...
there's something about her
that's just like Elly..."

Fei
"You don't think so...?"

Citan
"Yes, now that you mention
it...
She does resemble Elly."

Citan
"But that is not what I
was talking about...
I meant that the brush
techniques and overall
style used in this picture
is similar to yours."

Fei
"...Really?"

Fei
"Does it...?"

Fei
"First of all...
I'm nowhere near
as good an artist."

Citan
"No...it is very similar
to your style."

Citan
"But somehow I can sense
an atmosphere of sadness
in this picture."

Citan
"She is smiling, but in a
way, gives the impression
that she is anxious."

Citan
"Perhaps the picture is
reflecting her inner self?"

Citan
"Or perhaps it is the
inner feelings of the
artist being conveyed."

Citan
"Ahh...
If you look closely,
you will notice that
the painting is not
completely finished."

"The artist put his
brushes down when it
was near completion."

Citan
"...Why is that?"

Margie
"I don't know...
But my grandmother
might have known
about it..."

Margie
"Oh! What if we ask Agnes?
She may know something."

Margie
"Alright then, I'll
be with Sister Agnes."

Bart
"Well...shall we head
back to the town for
now?"

Citan
"Yes, alright...
But this painting has
caught my curiosity.
Do you mind if I speak
to Sister Agnes before
we head back to town?"

Bart
"Yeah, okay...
We'll stop by her
room on the way out."

        Lacan...

Citan
"Is something wrong, Fei?
You look like you are
daydreaming..."

Fei
"Huh?
No...
It's nothing..."

————————————————————————————
Nisan Cathedral Library - 0800
————————————————————————————

Agnes
"I understand you were
shown Sophia's portrait.
The lady portrayed in
that picture is Nisan's
great founding mother...
Some say that it was
painted at least 500
years ago.

Citan
"500 years ago...
Now that is quite amazing.
Personally, I find it
intriguing. Do you have
any historical material
from that period?

Agnes
"In our hands, there are no
such records left intact.
All records and materials
concerning Sophia have
been lost...
The portrait is the only
thing left.
We too do not have much
knowledge about her."

Citan
"That is too bad!
So there really is
nothing left at all!?"

Agnes
"For someone who has helped
Marguerite, I would have
loved to have shared them...
But unfortunately I am
unable to help here..."

Citan
"Oh well, none the matter.
Please do not worry about
it. I was just inquiring."

Citan
"But, it does seem
somewhat strange...
If such a majestic building
as this survived history,
then it is likely a scroll
or two would remain too."

Agnes
"According to tradition,
Sophia was present about
500 years ago...
She sacrificed herself for
the people and has been
summoned to be with god.
That's all I can tell you."

Citan
"...I see.
So everything was lost in
the darkness of history."

————————————————————————————

Margie
"I wonder what kind
of person Sophia was.
I would have loved to
have met her."

Nun 1
(... Somewhere...
It must be somewhere...
The truth that we have
not yet come to know.)

Oh!? That scared me.

Fei
"You're very devoted."

Nun 1
Uh, well sort of...
It's just that after
sneaking into the capital,
I started to think about
a lot of things...
And I've come to realize
the world isn't right
the way it is now!

————————————————————————————

Nun 1
Yes,  the world isn't right
the way it is now!

Nun 2
Why does war never
disappear from this world?
To me, it is clear that
it is meaningless...
Perhaps it is our fate
to be forever at discord
with each other?

Nun 3
The road we must take
is out there somewhere.
A way out of the confusion
we are now facing...
The sister sitting diagonally
across from me, is desperately
looking for that answer.

Nun 4
We're transcribing scrolls.
Scrolls over 100 years old
get worn, so we renew them.
It is one of our daily
tasks.

Nun
I want to see with my
own eyes what will
become of this country.

Soldier 1
As a matter of fact, the
guy next to me and I were
born here.
Years ago, we both got
tired of the peaceful but
boring life here, so we
ran away from home.
But we both ended up
enlisting in the army.
It's not that we have any
particularly happy memories
or whatever here...
it's just that, after all,
this is the land of our
birth, so well y'know...

Man
Preparations should be starting
near the border of this sect's
country for the charge by
the Royal Capital's army.
But a miscalculated move
directed on the enemy is
certain to backfire
on us, so we'll be taking covert
action for a while.
I'm on my way there now, but I
thought I'd offer a prayer
before I go.

Bart
"Ah!"

Maison
"Yo-ung ma--ste-r!"

Maison
"The people of Nisan were
most generous to allow us
to rent this house.
So there will be no need
to seek lodgings at the
inn for a while.
Also, Master Sigurd
wishes a word with you
regarding your next move,
if he may..."

Bart
"Alright...
So where is Sig?"

Maison
"The good Master Sigurd is
 waiting for you inside."

Bart
"Okay, thanks Maison."

Sigurd
"Whenever I come here it

Sigurd
"Anyway, young master...
I want to work out what our
plans from here on are."

Bart
"Alright.
But before we do that...
there is something I want
to ask you."

Sigurd
"...Me?"

Bart
"Yeah."

Bart
"Sig...
What's up with you and
that Gebler officer?
What's the connection
between you and him...?
You know, you sure know
a lot about Gebler for
some reason!"

Sigurd
"...Alright.
I'll tell you."

Sigurd
"Me and...
Citan, here...
We used to live
in Solaris."

Bart
"Solaris...
...You mean...
where Gebler's from?"

Sigurd
"That's right."

Sigurd
"Solaris...
calls foreigners
'Lambs'...
They are used as manual
labor. Basically it's
slavery."

Bart
"Slavery?"

————————————————————————————
??? Cut lines?

Fei
"...Lambs..."

Fei
"Elly used that
term earlier too."

————————————————————————————

Bart
"Is that where
you met him?"

Citan
"Yes, it was there."

Sigurd
"We worked for the
Solaris government
for a short while...
But we learned to
dislike their methods
and escaped the first
chance we had."

Bart
"...You were
friends with
these people?"

Bart
"I met you when I was a kid
and we've been together
ever since then...
So this would have had to
have happened even before
then."

Bart
"I probably wouldn't have
understood this if I had
heard it earlier but...
...Why didn't you think I
could deal with it now?
Surely you could have
told me about this?
Especially when you had
something to do with the
people who are backing
that Shakhan idiot!"

Bart
"I wish you'd
told me sooner."

Sigurd
"...There's nothing I
can do about that now."

Sigurd
"But, there's one thing
I want you to believe...
We left Solaris on our
own will and for our own
reasons.
Now they've appeared
before us, we can't
just sit back and do
nothing.
If need be, I will give
my life to stop them."

Bart
"Alright, I understand.
But can you elaborate
a little more?"

    Where is Solaris?
    What are Lambs?
    Who is that man?
    Why did you leave?

Bart
"What bugs me is this
'Surface Dwellers'
thing...
It's as if Solaris is
in another location.
Like up in the clouds
or something?"

Sigurd
"Yes, well..."

  Sigurd
  "Etrenank, the captial
  of the Solaris empire is
  located in the skies above.
  Solaris is separated from
  the land by dimensional
  distortion fields known
  as 'Gates'.
  Passing between the two
  requires special means of
  transportation...
  such as an airship."

Sigurd
"To get to Aveh we stowed
away on a regular flight
to the surface."

Citan
"I came much later
than Sigurd did...
But I also escaped
in the same way."

————————————————————————————

Bart
    What are Lambs?
	
Sigurd
"That is the word Solarians
use to indicate those who
live on the earth.
As I said before, such
'surface dwellers' or
'earth dwellers' are used
for manual labor there."

Sigurd
"Manual labor could be
anything from soldiers to
administrative jobs.
Solaris gathers its
workforce from the land
dwellers. Jobs are divided
up by who is most suitable.
Sometimes people are
brainwashed."

Bart
"Brainwashed!?"

Sigurd
"I...
When you, young master,
were still an infant...
I was used as a test
subject. There was
probably something they
valued inside of me."

Fei
"You too, doc?"

Citan
"No...
I was born in the lower
city levels. It is not
a complete secret...
But I guess I am a
Solarian..."

Citan
"You see...
You still need people
to run a country...
...No matter how
scientifically advanced
you are, you have no
support without people."

Sigurd
"Pure Solarians are rare.
They would not even make
up a quarter of Aveh's
total population.
So, they support their
country by stealing
surface dwellers."

————————————————————————————

Bart
    Who is that man?
	
Sigurd
"His name is, Kahr...
Kahran Ramsus.
As you know he's the
Gebler Commander."

Bart
"Ramsus...?"

Sigurd
"We call him Kahr.
In Solaris there is an
officer training school
called 'Jugend'.
He became the commander
after leaving there."

Citan
"He is a lower level
citizen, the same as me.
However, with his amazing
abilities...
After graduating, he rose
through the ranks with
unparalleled speed."

Sigurd
"That man had one ideal.
To achieve a consolidation
of all his colleagues.
Even land dwellers, if they
had talent, were brought
into the army."

Bart
"So you two were
picked by Ramsus...?"

Citan
"No, we were not picked
by him...we aligned
ourselves with him."

Sigurd
"At that time...
we agreed with him."

Citan
"At the time,
Ramsus was our hope.
He had high ideals and
wanted to change the
system in Solaris.
To us test subjects and
lower level citizens,
he was truly all that
we wished for."

Bart
"A benefactor?"

Sigurd
"Yes...even I, a test
subject, was changed
by his ideals."

————————————————————————————

Bart
    Why did you leave?

Bart
"So why was it that
you wanted to flee
from Solaris?"

————————————————————————————
Nisan - 0792
————————————————————————————

  Sigurd
  "We were placed in key
  military positions by
  Ramsus...
  And thanks to that, we came
  to know the relationship
  between Solaris and the
  surface dwellers."

  Bart
  "The...'Lambs'...right?

       Sigurd
       "They weren't just using us
       'Lambs' for slave labor...
       They also selected some of
       us, like me, to be used as
       subjects in experiments to
       refine their drugs...
       Drugs that change people's
       personalities, to make them
       more aggressive and to draw
       out their latent abilities.
       They were using us as human
       guinea pigs to test their
       psychological alteration
       drugs!"

  Bart
  "Human guinea pigs...!?
  Experimenting on humans?"

  Sigurd
  "Yes, for example...

               'Drive'

     That drug, and all others
     like it that are used
     now, are by-products of
     human experimentation..."

     Citan
     "However, the role of such
     experimental subjects was
     not limited to just that!"

————————————————————————————
Nisan Villa - 0778
————————————————————————————

Fei
"This 'Drive' drug is
something that anyone in
the Solaris army can use?"

Citan
"At least anyone in the
Gebler forces who is sent
to the surface..."

Bart
"You're worried
about her, huh?"

Fei
"...!"

Bart
"I saw some...
in her room."

Fei
"No..."

Bart
"...Anyway...using slaves
as guinea pigs...
How low are these guys...?"

Bart
"Damn!"

    Ask again
    I understand
	
Bart
"Hmm...I think I
get most of it."

Bart
"Old Maison!
Go reserve the town
hall for us. We'll
finish talking there.
I'm going outside to
get some air."

————————————————————————————

Maison
"I am sure the young
master would never have
dreamed of such a tale."

Fei
"...I guess you
already knew?"

Maison
"Well, now that you ask...
yes I did.
However, when Sigurd was
telling his story I thought
it was best to stay quiet.
Please try and help the
young master come to terms
with all that he has just
heard."

————————————————————————————
Nisan - 0792
————————————————————————————

Bart
"I had no idea Sig 
had such a past..."

Citan
"Are you still
suspicious of
Sigurd...?"

Bart
"Well...I mean...
it was just so sudden.
I kind of expected to hear
something different...
like that we were childhood
rivals or something...
But that's nothing compared
to the story he just told
us, is it?"

Citan
"Hmm. So hearing his story
has you confused because it
was not so simple...
There was a time when he
was cooperating with one
of Gebler's generals...
Furthermore, behind Gebler
was a country that you had
never even heard of..."

Bart
"Hey, what are you
picking on me for?"

Citan
"No I am not picking on you
or blaming anything on you.
What I am saying is this...
If you think about how he
feels, then you should see
why he could not talk about
this with you till now."

Citan
"Looking at the activities
of Solaris toward other
countries up until now...
...It has never gone
beyond simply maintaining
their own empire, or
'self-preservation'.
And as you have seen, their
military power is immense.
So Sigurd was probably
thinking ahead...
First he was probably
concentrating on taking
care of the problems here
on the continent of Ignas.
Once things were settled
here, it would give him
a stronger foundation to
deal with Solaris later.
Which is a much better plan
than rushing straight into
a war he knew we could not
win. Quite logical, really.

Bart
"Sounds like you understand
one another pretty well."

Citan
"Well it is not like we are
newly acquainted, is it?
And we had talked about a
lot of things up until we
decided to escape from
Solaris."

Bart
"Speaking of that...
Why did you leave?
That Ramsus guy was
supposed to be a 'Star
of Hope' or something,
wasn't he?"

Citan
"Yes, I certainly thought
so at first.
But then I realized his way
of thinking really was not
that much of a change from
the previous system.
Basically, the only
difference was whether they
stressed people's rank and
class, or their skill.
The words had changed, but
it was still no different
from what Solaris itself
had been doing until then.
He had no intentions of
bringing everyone a
better way of life."

Bart
"In other words, he's an
elitist. I don't think
I like him much either."

Bart
"So, Citan...
Do you think I can
beat Gebler?"

Citan
"Why? Are you planning
on fighting them?"

Bart
"As long as they're
working with Shakhan,
there's no way around it.
The way things are going,
I'm sure we'll have to
fight them sooner or
later."

Citan
"Hmm...
I suppose so, but...
Even if we were to defeat
the Gebler forces here,
there is still Solaris,
to deal with.
If we are not careful, it
is possible that we may get
involved in a longer war
than that with Shakhan.
Do you not agree that
continuing the way we
have been going is rather
hard on everyone?
I think it is time we
try to get help from
a greater number of
people."

Bart
"So defeating Shakhan's
not going to get rid of
the likes of Gebler..."

Bart
"I know what you're
trying to say...
'To vanquish Gebler,
first gain thy throne!'
...Right?"

Citan
"Hmm...
You could put it that way."

Bart
"What do you mean...
'You could put it that
way'?
But then again, maybe it
is time I did something
about that."
