"...Sig and I will
take two men and head
for the top floor.
Citan, you take the two
remaining men and open
the castle gate to let
in our main force.
If we can catch Shakhan
we are sure to succeed."

Citan
"Right. When you capture 
Shakhan give the signal.
It is probably best to 
open the gate at that 
time."

Bart
"Above us is the
Castle Bailey.
The keep must fall
quickly.
Shakhan should be
on the top floor."

Sigurd
"...In the room that
used to be used by the
young master's father.
Try not to damage the
castle, avoid all need-
less combat, and above
all, remember - speed!"

Bart
"That's why there are so
few of us.
Our objective is Shakhan!
So ignore the Gebler and
Aveh soldiers."

We must succeed at all
costs."

Pirate 1
Damn Shakhan...
When I get a hold of him
I'll swing him around by
his hair...after I've given
him a hair transplant.

Pirate 2
Soon I'll return to the
castle! I wonder if the
old man from the dining
hall is still alive?

Pirate 3
Let's not fight with
our cousins in the Aveh
army and finish this.

Pirate 4
Pull yourself together.

Old Man
Could this be...His
Highness Bartholomew?
It's been a long time.
You were still a child
when your father, the
King, passed away.
How I miss those days.
I am glad to see that
you are still alive!

Bart
"Old man, that was then
but this is now.
When things calm down,
I'll come back."

————————————————————————————

Congratulations on your
return, your Highness.
I knew this day would come
and have been protecting
the water reservoir.
I knew you didn't die.

Even though the war
is over, this old man
has no home or family
to return to.
My only family is this
stray cat.

What!?
You can't go in there! 
Everyone drinks from

Sigurd
"Crap! An ambush!"

Citan
"Oh-oh...!
Where is Kahr...?"

Miang
"I see you are quick
to catch on.
Ramsus should be taking
care of all your divided
forces out by the Nisan
border as we speak.
Ramsus easily saw through
your plan to use a feint
attack by Kislev long ago.
Don't underestimate us...
Hyuga, have you lived
down here so long that
your mind has slipped?
And Sigurd, who would have
thought you would have
joined the last survivors
of the royal dynasty..."

Sigurd
"Damn it...why are you
still backing Shakhan?
What does it matter to
you who the king is?"

Miang
"Hah! You suggest the son
of murdered King Fatima?
He refused to cooperate!
You mean to say that now
he wants to be our
puppet all of a sudden?
That I don't believe...
even coming from the mouth
of a traitor like you.
Ha ha ha... Besides,
stupidity in puppets
has its advantages."

Shakhan
"Stu, stupidity!?
Miang, what's that
supposed to mean?"

Miang
"Minister Shakhan, I'll let
you handle this. You must
protect your own position.
We don't care who is
sitting on the throne.
Any obedient sheep
would be fine.
However, isn't there 
something that you
still have to do?
If you will only do that,
then we'll help you as
much as possible."

Shakhan
"Yes, you don't have
to tell me.
One must take care of
one's own country's
criminals personally."

Miang
"Then, with your
permission I shall
take my leave..."

Bart
"Hey now! 
Wait a minute!!"

Miang
"Goodbye...boys."

Shakhan
"You pirate...no you're
just a sandworm. You've
caused me enough shame.
But this is the end. You
didn't know your place
and now all that awaits
you is annihilation.
Prepare to fire...!"

Shakhan
"Wha!?"

Maison
"You wretched rebel,
Shakhan!
Make one move and
this gatling gun
shall be spitting
fire!"

Maison

arrived, young master.
Please come aboard."

We'll settle this later."

Bart

go get your
head waxed!"

Citan
"This...

Shakhan
"Is this some kind of joke?
Hmm, It seems sandworms
can't fly after all.
Just surrender.
Thanks for the laughs...
I almost hate to have
to shoot you."

Bart

gonna get mauled..."

you could operate
such a thing."

Maison
"It's a trick I picked
up long ago...
It's nothing special.
I'm no expert on it.
I'm actually a bit
embarrassed about it."

Sigurd
"Young master!
The Royal Capital's

We were the ones who took

before we get caught!
Head for the bridge as

How are the repairs?"

Engineer
"The main engine and effect-
fins' oscillators are mostly
unharmed...
...but the electrical
connections between them
are wasted.
We are bypassing the main
connection and trying to
scrape together all the 
energy we can.
But it will only give us
70% of our usual maximum
power at best.
The propulsion-drills are
not damaged, but if the
sand can't be granulated
they might as well be.
We'll make battle speed 3
...only barely."

'Mister Puniverse' got
to say?"

"Sig! Listen!
Surrendering isn't going to
change Nisan's fate.
We'll lose the Yggdrasil,
the core of our power in
saving Aveh and Margie.
I know it looks bad, but
you can still count on us!"

I'm not dying today!!

Perhaps they have political
motives that involve Margie

"That's probably it, Sig!
But they're forgetting one
thing...
It's harder to bring in an

"Don't do anything 
unwarranted, Miang! 
I still have one arm!!"

Miang
"We're pulling out!
...That mad dog seems
to have a new toy to
play with."

Well, now that my motor
coil's warmed up...
...let's start the main 
event!!

Bart
"Today's my unlucky day.
Why does this have to
happen now?
Oh well...
Let's get it over with!"

Sigurd
"Young master!!!"

Sigurd
"Engine, ready for full
power!! Jerico! Give me
the helm over here!"

But first mate!
Now with the effect-fins out
of order, if you run at full
speed, the ship wouldn't be
able to stand the friction!!

Sigurd
"It can 'jump' due to the
Bernoulli effect on the
wings' surfaces instead!!"

First mate!!

Sigurd
"Never mind that!
The Yggdrasil is nothing
without the young master!
Full power!!
Maximum speed!!"

Sigurd
"Eeeeeaaaaarrrrgghh!!!!
Come on, GO!!!"

Sigurd
"Young master! 
Are you okay!?"

Bart
"Don't over do it, Sig...
Trying to make our ship
'fly'...!?
When we get back it'll 
take a month to get this 
heap of junk working 
again."

Sigurd
"Ha..ha ha...
You seem to
be okay!"

Bart
"...Shees!!
What was that
monster anyway?"

Bart
"Sig!
What's going on?"

Sigurd
"What...the ship? 
The engine should have 
fallen out, but..."

Sigurd
"What in the hell?"

That was pretty
interesting.

But dropping a warship
on me is cheating...
Take it back!

Bart
"Sig!! Maison!!...
Uah..."

Desert Despair - Yggdrasil being Destroyed - 1156
————————————————————————————

The sand pump, effect-fins
and propulsion-drills are
all out of commission!!

Main engine, support engine,
engage the auto scram.
Switch power to batteries.
Output ratio 0.5,
operating time...500!!

Franz
"The third bridge
...it's ruined!!"

The hangar section, the
armament section, and even
the pressure shell have
been destroyed!!
We can't stop the sand
from flowing in!

Sigurd
"Close each section down
completely and commence
independent operation!!"

Franz
"Then, damage control 
won't be able to move!!
The hole won't be
covered!!"

Sigurd
"That's alright!!
...Either way, it's
impossible to save
the entire ship.
Our priority is to
secure the bridge!!
Gather everyone
into the bridge
immediately!"

Sigurd
"...Hyuga... No...
you're Citan now.
You need to get out.
I'll have Maison
guide you to an
escape-pod."

Citan
"I cannot leave you
all like this...!?"

Sigurd
"We have no right to keep
you here and get you
involved.
...If you see Kahr and
Miang, make sure you
pay'em back for me."

Sigurd
"Maison...
Please show him the way."

Maison
"This way, please."
