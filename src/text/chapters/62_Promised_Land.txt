Promised Land - Elly in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

Overcome by indescribable
fear, I decided ascend to
Shevat which was stationed
in the skies above Nisan.
Awaiting me there was a
transmission from Krelian...
 
He told me that if I
wanted to save Fei and
the others, I would have
to come to Golgoda.
 
Krelian wanted me.

In order to save Fei and my
other friends, I departed
in the last Omnigear left
remaining in Shevat.
 
My previous fear of riding in
this machine was surmounted
by my desire to rescue the
people dear to me.

Renk
"Are you serious about
going it alone!?"

Elly
"Krelian told me to
come by myself."

Elly
"I can't afford to break
the agreement.
So please, stay behind and
protect everyone here."

Helmholz
"But, it's a trap!"

Elly
"I know."

Stratski
"Then why!?"

Elly
"If I do not go, Fei and
them will be executed for
sure...
Krelian isn't concerned
with anyone else but me."

Renk
"So what makes you think
he's going to hold his
part of the bargain?
Do you have any way of
knowing that you will
definitely save your
friends by doing this?"

Elly
"No..."

Vance
"Then it's suicide!"

Elly
"It might be."

Elly
"But, I've made it this
far because of Fei and
the others...
Because they accepted me
as their friend."

Renk
"If you go away...
what about us...?
What about all the people
who have assembled in Nisan
that you leave behind?
Everyone's depending on
you for their spiritual
support."

Elly
"The people in Nisan will
be fine.
They can stand on their own
feet without any support
from me... This is also
true of you all, right?"

Broyer
"But why do you do
so much for him...?"

Elly
"I don't know...
I guess it's a woman's
prerogative to be selfish
...perhaps."

Helmholz
"A woman's prerogative...?"

Elly
"I'm not a holy woman of
any sort.
I'm just a regular woman.
I get angry...
I cry...
I laugh...
Although at times I can
resent others, I also
know how to love others.
Loving whole masses of
people at times...and
loving just one person
the rest of the time...
I am in supreme bliss
when I am embraced by
the man that I love."

Elly
"Giving what I have to him,
and receiving what he gives
me, we become one flesh...
That is the moment when I
am most at peace."

Elly
"It is my prerogative as
a woman to simply want to
save the man that I love!"

Vance
"Boss..."

Elly
"I'm sorry...for saying
such selfish things."

Elly
"I'll go and do all that
I can do for my friends.
So I want you all to do
whatever it is you can do
for our friends here."

Renk
"..."

Elly
"Well, I had better
get going now..."

Citan
"Elly!?"

Fei
"You idiot!
Why did you come here!?"

Fei
"Krelian's after you!
Forget about us!
Run and save yourself!!"

Elly
"I came as I was told.
I'm the only one you
need...
They have nothing to
do with this.
So let Fei and the
others go!"

Krelian
"How gallant you are,
Elhaym.
It's as if 'that scene
from the past has been
brought back to life
in the present'.
So, you came in an
Omnigear.
That too is...
'her Gear'.
Hmmm...
Allow me to confirm
something."

Krelian
"I'll consider what kind of
treatment your friends will
receive...on one condition.
...That you first defeat
these two men here with
that Gear you came in...
How about it, Elhaym?"

Fei
"Forget it, Elly!
He's up to something!
Don't accept it!"

Citan
"Fei is right!
Krelian is not a man
of his word...
And he always has
ulterior motives when
he sweet talks someone!
What is more, those men
are fighting machines
created by Krelian.
Their combat skills are
immeasurable! They are
not opponents you can
handle by yourself!
Do not take him up
on his offer!
Escape while you can!!"

Krelian
"My my...
Such harsh criticism.
I am not that brutal.
So, what will it be Elhaym?
Even if you were to try to
flee now, it is not likely
you would be able to...
You see...
I have this whole area
surrounded by my guards!"

Krelian
"Wouldn't it be logical to
take the choice where you
may still stand a chance...
...No matter how slight it
may be?"

Fei
"Don't do it, Elly!"

Elly
"Alright then...
I'll do what you say"

Krelian
"Good.
You are indeed my
precious little bird.
Now, get on with it!"

Elly
"If it gives Fei and
them even the slightest
chance of escape...
Then I will fight!
I don't care if it even
costs me my life!!"

Elly
"They're too fast!!"

Elly
"Outmatched...
Even in my Omnigear...
But...I can't just...
No...not like this..."

Elly
"I can't lose!!"

Elly
"M, must... somehow...
stop... movement..."

Elly
"Stopped!?
Now's my chance!
Haaaaaaaaaah!"

Elly
"Did I do it!?"

Elly
"H, how could that...!?
I thought it had some
sort of effect..."

"Girl, that hurt!
I'll get you back!!"
"It was wrong of you
to underestimate
our power!"

Elly
"Gaah..."

Elly
"Guh...!
... Huff...
Huff..."

Rattan (*???add*)
"Hmmm, I'm getting no
results. It can't be
helped, Mugwort.
It's about time to
finish the job."

"Gahahahah! 
Downed yet!?"
"It's to be expected.
Multiple fractures,
major blood loss...
I wouldn't be surprised
if the cockpit is a sea
of blood."
"At worst, death!
Geh hah hah hah!!"

"What the... !?
There's no way you could
stand after taking that
much damage..."

"M, Mugwort!!?"

"Why you! How dare you
do that to my partner!"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"No way...!
Elly...!"

Krelian
"Her true awakening...?
Or just merely...
'protecting her master'...?
Either way, it does not
alter the fact that she is
the -Mother- existence that
I have been searching for!"

Krelian
"Now men...
recover that machine.
Place priority on the
safety of the pilot.
Use whatever it takes
to preserve her life!"

Krelian
"Well then, I shall be
taking this girl with me!
As for the rest of you...
Why don't you just wallow
there pathetically while
you meditate on your own
lack of any real power."

Grahf
"Pitiful..."

Grahf
"You can't even protect
a single woman.
It is not even worth
the effort of putting a
spineless wretch like
you out of your misery!"

————————————————————————————

Fei (*???add*)
Elly was taken away...
And, as Krelian had told
her, we were left alive...
 
Was Krelian just keeping
his promise...
No, that can't be it...
 
There had to be another
'real' reason why he
allowed us to live...

And we had to find that out...

Blue 1
The fleshly body of god
has been recovered...

Red 2
The Anima and the Animus
have all been obtained...

Blue 3
All that is left for us
to do is change into the
Animus, and become one with
the mother -Persona-...

Krelian
"...That is incorrect."

Blue 2
What?
What do you mean, Krelian?
What did you just say?

Blue 4
What are you doing!?
Krelian, have you gone
totally insane!?

Red 3
What are you doing
to the memory banks!?

Red 2
Do not touch them!
We cannot survive
without them...!

Krelian
"You were the only
ones who could have
activated the key...
But now that it has been
activated, I no longer
need you. I am having
you all erased."

Red 3
How dare you!

Krelian
"The only obstacle that
kept me from my goals was
Cain.
He was the one person who
had total control of the
people and thus was my
greatest nemesis.
But the only person who
could terminate Cain was
Cain himself.
That's why I created...
'a copy of Cain'.
Ramsus acted exactly as I
predicted...killing Cain.
Now, there is no one who
can stop 'me'.
And I'm not interested in
your power or authority.
Did you really think you
were acting on your own
free will? You are all
just parts of the system.
Created only as weapons of
invasion and oppression...
You are just terminal
interface weapons."

Blue 1
We...can...
become...god!
And...you're...

Krelian
"God?
Who said you'd be god?
What impertinence!
We are 'humans'. We were
created to be terminal
interfaces of god.
It is the same for you,
who were once humans.
'Man cannot become god.'
...We can only entrust
ourselves to god."

Blue 1
Ri...diculous...
Going... a...gainst
the... Mother...

Krelian
"I have not gone against
her. This is the will of
the 'other mother'."

Blue 1
You...think...you...
can...elim...inate...
us...and...still...
...revi...ve...god...?

Krelian
"It can be done.
Your genes were scattered
in order to keep the world
alive after the 'Fall' in
days of destruction.
Those genes live on today
within the humans.
The -Anima- vessels...
and the recipients of their
alignment, the -Animus-...
and also the -Persona-...
By combining these with my
nanomachines, humans will
become living beings very
much the equivalent of you.
Actually, they may far
surpass you in becoming
worthy terminal interfaces
for god.
So you are no longer of
any use to me. -Deus-, the
physical manifestation of
god, only wants results...
The means are insignificant
to him...
So this is my 'Ark Plan'...
My -Project Noah-!"

Blue 1
K...re...li...

Krelian
"May all your worries
cease. Rest in peace...
ancestors of mortal man!"

Krelian
"Now, it is just
you and I...Sophia!"
