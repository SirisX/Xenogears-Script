Intruder Alert! - Shevat Queen Zephyr's Chamber - 1512
————————————————————————————

Zephyr
"Have you decided?"
    My heart is set!
    Let me think some more

————————————————————————————
-OPTION 2-

Zephyr
"Take your time and think
about it to your heart's
content.
To make sure there are no
regrets."

————————————————————————————

Zephyr
"Alright. (*this line is cut here in-game)
Allow me to hear out
your decision."

Fei
"Huh...!?"

Fei
"What was that shaking
all about...!?"

Maria
"Your Majesty...!"

Maria
"Was that enemy...!?"

Man
Your Majesty,
something dreadful
has...!!

Zephyr
"What's the meaning of
this?"

Man
Yes! That is... We have an
intruder in the dock area!
The Gate generator has been
destroyed...!

Fei
"What!?"

Zephyr
"What's the damage report?"

Man
Y, yes! Sub-systems are
destroyed...
Gate generation has
dropped 70% from normal!
We're devoting everything
to fire fighting and
repairs... It will still
take some time!

Zephyr
"What of the intruder?"

Man
Yes, we believe it's just
a lone Gebler soldier.
It seems the individual
has escaped to the number
17 hangar!

Maria
"Number 17 hangar bay!?
Seibzehn...!!"

Zephyr
"Maria, wait!"

Zephyr
"It is too dangerous
to go by yourself."

Maria
"But...
We can't just let
the spy be...!"

Man
Your Majesty, we have our
hands full just trying to
fight the fire on the
shield generator.
If someone doesn't do
something, it's possible
we'll have more losses...!

Maria
"I'll be fine.
I can go it alone...!!"

Zephyr
"Maria, what can you do
now when you don't even
have Seibzehn?"

Maria
"...!
But..."

Fei
"Then should we go down
with Maria?
It's the Gebler, right?
I'm still ticked off at
them. I'll take'em on."

Zephyr
"...
Is it fine with you, Fei?
Please take care of Maria.
And be careful out there."

Fei
"Then, let's get
going, Maria."

Maria
"Then, let's all go
together."

Man
Umm, this may be asking for
too much, but would it be
possible to have one of you
stay behind with the Queen?

We do not have the combat
experience and...if
something ever happened to
the Queen...

Fei
"Alright, I got it.
Then one of us should
stay behind."

Who will you leave here?
    Leave <Perso2>
    Leave <Perso3>

Maria has joined the party!

Oh my, this has gotten
serious. It seems you can't
get in because of the
emergency security.
But, you are all lucky.
A legendary vendor like
me happens to be here
through coincidence.
I've got a line of quality
goods, sir... So, if you've
got anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

Alright, then what
shall it be?

    Items
    Weapon/Armor
    Gear Parts
    Nevermind

Thank you very much.
If there's anything you
need, please come by
again.

Guard 1
In hopes of making contact
with you and your friends
on the ocean surface...
...the shields were
apparently dropped.
That's when they took
advantage of the situation.
Who would've ever thought
there would actually be a
spy that would get in!?

Guard 2
We aren't permitted to
leave here no matter what.
So please, take good care
of Maria for us!

Shevat Elevator Shaft - 1482

Maria
"It's no use!
The defensive shutter is
closed..."

Fei
"Isn't there another way to
go down to the hangar?"

Maria
"We may be able to go
down if we use the 
emergency shaft. 
But it's not normally
used..."

Fei
"I don't care.
We can't waste time here
anyway."

Citan
"You are right.
It is not like the enemy
is going to wait for us."

Maria
"I see.
The entrance to the shaft
is just above here."

Maria
"This is it.
We can go down by entering
the shaft from here."

Fei
"Fine!
Then, let's go!"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Elly
"You're right.
They won't wait for us."

Bart
"That's right!
They won't wait for us."

Rico
"That's right.
They won't wait for us."

Billy
"That's right.
They won't wait for us."

Emeralda
"...
We're wasting time."

Chu-Chu
"That's right! Chu go out
there and chu blow them
away as quickly as we can.
That's the best way chu
do it!"

Maria
"This map is of the
lower layer levels in
the emergency shaft.
You can use it once we
get down to the floor
several levels below
here."

can change the direction
the windmill is spinning."

Shevat Corridors - 1496
————————————————————————————

Maria
"You can use the map you
found earlier on this
floor.
It's always good to have
a map to look at when you
lose your way, right!?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Fei
"Hey, that map we found
above here... It looks
like it's for this floor.
If we lose our way, we
can look at that map."

Shevat Hallway - 1502

Maria

manhole, we'll be able to

Maria
"Where is the
intruder...!?"

Hmph, it's you again...
You pests aren't making
my job any easier.

Elly
"Dominia...!
Is that you!?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- Fei

Fei
"Dominia!"

————————————————————————————

Dominia
"Never thought I'd come
across Seibzehn
in my place of escape."

Dominia
"I'll take
Seibzehn.
Originally, this 
belonged to us,
Solaris."

Elly
"Dominia!
I can't let you have the
Gear!"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- Fei

Fei
"I can't let you have the
Gear!"

————————————————————————————

Dominia
"Heh, then try and
stop me!"

Dominia
"Huh...?"

Dominia
"That child...
Hey, you...
Are you the daughter
of Nikolai...?"

Maria
"Undoubtedly, I am the
daughter of Nikolai,
Maria Balthasar!
What about it...?"

Dominia
"I see...
So you're his beloved
daughter to whom he offered
himself to undertake that 
difficult task..."

Dominia
"Hey, young girl.
Want to hear
an interesting story?
Let's see...
How about the cursed
secret of
Seibzehn?"

Maria
"...!?
What do you mean?"

Dominia
"What do I mean?
You'll understand it
when you hear the story."

For the past several
decades, our scientists
had put so much effort
into the research to
create evolved Gears.
Regardless of how great a
pilot one is, as long it
is human, there will
always exist a time lag
and human error when
interfacing with a
machine.
That's when your father,
Nikolai was targeted.
He was a genius in the
field of cranial nerve
mechanisms.
They made Nikolai search
for a way for humans to
go beyond humans... By
merging humans and
machines.
In other words, they were
trying to create a new
life, an ultimate living
weapon, by connecting a
living human brain to a
Gear directly.
It would've stayed as a
mere fantasy without
Nikolai. But that genius
made the fantasy come
true...

Maria
"That's a lie!!
My father wouldn't do
such a horrible thing!!"

Dominia
"I don't lie, Maria.
This is the truth.
Your splendid father
succeeded in fusing man
and machine.
And he opened the gates
to hell for the Lambs."

Maria
"...!!"

Dominia
As a matter of fact,
various data and
components obtained from
the war in Ignas, and the
Battling in Kislev, were
used as experimental
materials.
That is how the special
humanoid mutants, Wels
were born. Wels created
in Solaris were tested
on the surface.
Only the Wels that passed
the tests were dismantled,
restructured, and reborn.
They became the Gear's
central control circuit...
and became part of the
machine...
It's all the result of
your father's great
research.
Seibzehn, is the
prototype of 
a man-machine fusion
Gear.
In other words...
Seibzehn was completed
at the cost of innumerable
land dwellers' lives.

And in the nerve circuit
of Seibzehn lies...

Don't you think you've
said enough, Dominia?

Dominia
"Who is it!?"

Jessie
"Why are women so 
gossipy?
They jabber about
things they shouldn't
be talking about.
Hopeless..."

————————————————————————————
-ALT- Billy

Billy
"D, dad!?"

————————————————————————————

Dominia
"Jesiah!?
You...!?
What're you doing in
Shevat!?
At one point, weren't
you considered to be
the next Gebler
commander-in-chief!?"

Jessie
"Don't get so excited. (*??? line cut here)
It's not good for your
beauty, Dominia.
We adults have our own
reasons. But you kids
wouldn't understand."

Jessie
"I think you've played
with enough fire for
today. Just go home.
Maria is the only
one who can operate
Seibzehn.
You should be well aware
of that."

Dominia
"Hmph, fools!
Don't get so cocky.
The party's just begun.
But, I guess it's alright.
My mission is complete.
All that's left is..."

Dominia
"Maria, I'm afraid I must
go now.
Enjoy your party.
Hah hah hah...!"

Fei
"Wait!
Dominia!"

Maria
"...
Father..."

Fei
"Hey Maria.
Don't mind what she
told you..."

Maria
"..."

Fei
"...!?
This...is...?"

Jessie
"It looks like our guests
have arrived.
Let's go upstairs.
The Yggdrasil is also
accommodated in the dock.
I'm sure the other
guys are making a
fuss over it."

Jessie
"I have an ominous
premonition...
I doubt it but...
they could've..."

Maria
"Seibzehn..."
