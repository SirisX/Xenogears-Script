Friends Again - Yggdrasil Docked at Thames - 1230
————————————————————————————

Bart
"Sorry about what I
said earlier..."

Fei
"It's alright. I was at
fault too. I haven't seen
you in such a long time.
We shouldn't be fighting."

Bart
"Sigh...
The Yggdrasil II was
constructed so quickly
we had no time to ready
its depth charges.
Also it was my fault we
didn't have depth charges
because I prioritized the
Bart Missiles over...
...everything else."

Fei
"Bart Missiles?"

Bart
"Oh uh...um, well,
they're not that
great anyway."

Fei
"?
Anyway, I'm glad you're
okay.
I always knew that you'd
be alive."

Bart
"Of course.
I'm Bart the immortal.
Whaddya trying to say...?
But this time I got reamed
by a red Gear monster."

Fei
"A red Gear..."

Bart
"Yeah. He beat me and then
left us to sink into the
sand.
But this next part sounds
wild.
We sank into this huge cave
under the sand! And then
a sand cruiser just like
the Yggdrasil was there!
We replaced the usable
parts and the bridge and
remodeled it."

Citan
"Frankly, I do not believe
it myself. It looks
the same but it can float.
Most likely it is the
Yggdrasil's prototype."

Bart
"People lived there
long ago and they
had many weapons.
That's how we got them."

Citan
"Bart already showed me.
Those weapons are most
likely...from Shevat."

Fei
"Shevat......
you mean the aerial..."

Bart
"More importantly, we
should go say 'ahoy'
to the Captain."

Fei
"...Yeah."

Thames Screw Elevator - 1240

Bart
"I...didn't want to 
get her involved."

Fei
"You mean Margie...
Sorry, I know I promised...
that if anything happened,
I would protect Margie
and the people of Nisan."

Bart
"You're worried about that?
It's okay, you've had it
tough too.
I made it okay. That's my
job. When the
Yggdrasil's fixed, I'm
going on straight ahead..."

Bart
"Of course I know Nisan's
in danger. 
But since everything's
messed up there, I thought
now would be a good time
to sneak in there.
I didn't plan on taking
her along. As long as I
knew she was safe there."

Citan
"But I certainly doubt
Shakhan will just stand by
and do nothing..."

Bart
"That's what the people
from her Sect said too.
But it's still risky,
so they say they want
me to stay close to
her and protect her."

Fei
"Really...
And you're okay with
that?"

Bart
"...Yeah."

Thames Bridge - 1234

Captain
"I see you've brought
along another strapping
young lad."

Bart
"I'm Bart. Thanks for
letting my ship dock here."

Captain
"Gahahahahahahaha.
This's great. Ya come to
ask about the ship?"

Bart
"My submarine, Yggdrasil,
was damaged by an enemy
attack...
It'll be out of operation
for a little while..."

Margie
"Bart!
You're terrible.
You went on without me!"

Bart
"Aw Margie?
Just when I'm starting
to sound like a captain."

Margie
"I get away from Nisan
but then I'm stuck on
the Yggdrasil.
I'm sick of it.
Captain?
Hi, I'm Marguerite."

Bart
"Awww man! Look, we're
having a man to man talk
here.
So Margie, why don't you
go back to the Yggdrasil."

Margie
"You're terrible!
You're starting to
sound like Sig."

Bart
"What!
Me, like Sig?"

Margie
"You're always so
thoughtless, Bart.
Fei and the others
were floating around
because you fired on
that craft impulsively."

Bart
"Whoa, st, stupid,
you're not supposed to..."

Fei
"Bart...?
You...didn't...
No...you didn't..."

Citan
"It is true, Fei."

Bart
"Couldn't be helped.
How could I have known
you were..."

Fei
"I'm so disgusted, I
don't have anything
to say..."

Bart
"Don't get so mad."

Bart
"Tch. I shouldn't have
brought you out
of Nisan."

Margie
"I heard that,
you big jerk!"

Captain
"Gahahahaha.
Great, great.
It's great to be young."

Captain
"Hey, kiddo.
You supposed to be some
kinda pirate?"

Bart
"Oh yeah.
A man of the sea!
I was a man of the
desert but..."

Captain
"Alright!!
Even better.
Yes, man of the sea!
Bart, right?
I'll show you to our
famous beer hall."

Captain
"My lady, may I borrow
this fellow?"

Margie
"What a weird guy."

Margie
"Fei, are you mad
about Bart?"

Fei
"No that's not it..."

Margie
"......About Elly then?"

Fei
"......Yeah."

Margie
"It'll all be okay.
If you're so worried,
why don't you go rescue
her?"

Margie
"Just like...
Bart helped me out."

Fei
"......"

Dominia
"Cease your naive
utterances!"

Elly
"I've said nothing wrong!"

Dominia
"I have no intention of
discussing this matter
further with you!
Your traitorous actions
are already apparent!
I will beat you down
right here!!"

Stop it at once.

Miang
"Are you okay?"

Dominia
"Miang!
What are you doing!?
She is a traitor!"

Miang
"Such acts will not be
allowed on a ship under
Ramsus' command...
No matter the reason!
I have examined the
records of the battle
between the Haishao and
Vierge...
From what I can tell,
it was you who attacked
first, wasn't it?
She had no choice but to
defend herself after you
took it upon yourself to
attack without permission.
Above all, you were meant
to be under Kelvena's
command. Were you obeying
Kelvena's orders?"

Dominia
"..."

Miang
"You are not to prosecute
any soldier for treason
without proper authority.
Even if you both are
Elements. Further...
Isn't your attitude toward
the lieutenant, nothing
more than your own
personal prejudice...
Or am I mistaken?"

Dominia
"What!?
I would never..."

Miang
"Thus far, we still cannot
determine whether or not
she is guilty of treason.
To investigate the truth
of this matter further, I
am placing the lieutenant
under my supervision.
Is that clear?"

Dominia
"How dare you!
By what authority!?"

Miang
"Let's go."

Dominia
"...
Wha...what was that?
Those eyes..."

Miang
"...I see...
So that's what was
going on."

Elly
"..."

Miang
"Since I have other
matters to attend to,
would you mind staying
here for awhile?"

Elly
"Not at all."

Miang
"You don't have to worry
about a thing. Leave the
rest to me. 
What you need is to 
recover from your fatigue."

Miang
"Crystalline, blue... 
like the surface of a
lake..."

Elly
"Uh...excuse me?"

Miang
"Your eyes...
They're beautiful."

Elly
"What?"

Ramsus' Ship Bridge - 1150

Miang
"Here is the engagement
report between Haishao
and the enemy Gear."

Ramsus
"!!
This is the..."

Miang
"I'm sure of it.
It's currently at Thames.
If not, somewhere in the
ocean nearby."

Ramsus
"Change course!
Head for Thames..."

Miang
"Wait. Their mother ship
Yggdrasil seems to be
able to submerge.
If they submerge,
they'll have the upper
hand on Haishao.
Any attack we might make
would just be wasted
since they could
simply dive.
But if we eliminate that
function first, it's
still not too late.
I've already made the
proper 'arrangements'."

Ramsus
"Arrangements?"

Miang
"Yes, sir."

Ramsus
"All right.
We'll try it your way."

Miang
"Thank you, Commander."

Ramsus
"By the way... What
happened between you and
Dominia? She was livid."

Miang
"I'm sorry. It had to
do with that Yggdrasil
incident earlier.
Those girls work hard.
Especially for you...
It's my job to be hated."

Sigurd
"Fei, the young master
hasn't come back yet.
What's he up to?
Would it be too much to
ask for you to go and
call him for me?"

Fei
"No problem!
He's probably wining
and dining with the
Captain of the Thames!"

Thames Beer Hall - 1236

Bart
"They came out...
one after another...slam,
bam, crash...that's 
how it happened..."

Fei
"Hey Bart, Sigurd was
asking about you..."

Captain
"Gahahahahaha.
Of course, if you're not 
strong, you can't be a
man of the sea."

Bart
"Yeah, check this arm
out..."

Proof!

Of the men!

Of the sea!!

Fei
...

Captain
"Gahahahha."

Bart
"Wah ha ha ha."

Crew member
Captain, your first
mate is calling you.

Captain
"Oi, he's interrupting
our men of the sea story.
That Hans, he's such
an unrefined chap.
What does he want now?"

Crew member
Our Lady seems
to have returned...

Fei
"Our Lady...
Oh, you mean Elly!"

Captain
"Fool! 
Why didn't you
tell me earlier."

Crew member
Well...

Fei
"Well, let's go."
