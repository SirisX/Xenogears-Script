"Get a load of this!
I can't believe they'd
make such a thing..."

Citan
"...
Shall we see if it works?"

Fei
"Doc, do you know
how to operate it!?"

Citan
"Not really...
But, Fei...
You were not thinking of
stealing this big thing
without knowing how to
operate it, were you?"

Fei
Errr...

Citan
"Well, anyway..."

Citan
"Well then, shall we go?"
    Yeah, let's go
    Hang on a sec.

Citan
"Well everyone, this
could be dangerous,
so please be seated."

Citan
"Is everyone ready?"

Citan
"It will...
shake a little."

Rico
"Couldn't you
tell us..."

Hammer
"...
a bit sooner..."

do now?
Go to Aveh as planned?"

"Grahf!?"

Grahf
"The Goliath wasn't
built for you to use.
You must remain on this
land a little longer.
I can't allow you to
leave..."

————————————————————————————

Grahf
"So, you can now
draw upon more of
your power...
If that's the case
then..."

Citan
"Fei!
Hold on tightly now!!"

Grahf
"Huh!?"

Hammer
"Aaaaaaah!
Looook ooouut!!
Master Citan!! It's alright
to throw the black creep,
but bro and Master Rico as
well...?"

Citan
"If it is them,
they are okay.
Nevermind that,
Hammer, go to
that trigger!"

Hammer
"Trigger...?
You mean this?
What do I do with..."

Citan
"You must fire.
Look, it is coming."

Hammer
?

Hammer
"The~y're he~re!!"

Citan
"Hammer! Calm down and
concentrate. It is
heading straight at us.
All you have to do is
aim well, pull the
trigger and fire."

Hammer
"Aiming..."

Hammer
"L, like this?"

Citan
"Good, keep it there and
do not move your aim.
Get ready to fire in..."

5...4...3...2...1...
Fire!!

Hammer
"Y, ye, ye,
aaaaaawwww yeeeaaahhh!!!"

Hammer
"Master, sir, did you
just see my MAD SKILLZ!?
I just might be a genius!
...Wha?"

Hammer
"By the way, what's up
with bro and the gang?
You don't think they
fell off?"

Hammer
"Well, at least you
still got me.
It should be a piece
o'cake with me around.
Right, Master, sir?"

SMACK!!

Fei
"...Doc. I don't know how
to say this but...I've got
a bad feeling."

Citan
"Are you thinking of
that man in black?
Thinking about him will
not get you anywhere.
First of all, it is not
like you..."

Fei
"It's not that.
It's not like...
It's like this feeling
of uneasiness that
I've had before..."

Citan
"You too!?
Well, to tell the truth,
I am getting a terrible
feeling of deja vu..."

Fei
"And I feel like we're
being watched..."

It's huge...
It appears to be a...

That's it! The Goliath!
The one from the

Crap...they're taking

Threat is minimal from
looking at the radar

What is happening?
What was the alarm
all about...?"

"Young master! Again!!?"

"Battle stations, everyone!
Surface navigation!
Close the vents!
Blow the main tank!
Prepare for anti-aircraft
battle upon surfacing!"

Sigurd
"Just doesn't know
when to give up..."

Maison
"Y, young master!
The Gungany Missiles...
You need permission from
more than a half of the
crew members to..."

Bart

Stand by with the

Gunner!
Give me the trigger

"What's wrong?"

Fei
"Oh, it's nothing."

Elly
"Okay... I'm glad..."

Elly
"Anyway, Citan is it
okay? We're flying in
such a large ship. 
What if Kislev or Aveh
finds us..."

Citan
"We are fine. I thought
ahead and picked a course
over the sea.
There are not any military
units stationed out here.
Even then, this thing is
not something that will
go down so easily..."

Citan
"This cannot be right!?
Are we being attacked!?"

Fei
"Enemies!?"

Citan
"I do not know. But I did
not think they would be
submerged here..."

Elly
"Are we okay!?"

Citan
"...Unfortunately, there
is no way we can avoid
descending.
Fei, Elly, get out first.
I will follow later."

Fei
"But..."

Citan
"We have no time for a
debate now, Fei!!
Do you think you have the
skills needed to keep the
Goliath in the air as long
as possible!?"

Fei
"..."

Citan
"Then hurry up
and get out."

Citan
"Now then..."

Citan
"...And you too, Hammer!
You are going too!"

Hammer
"Y, yy, yessir!!"

Rico
"Argh! Quit dawdling.
We're going."

Hammer
"Yessir!!"

Ramsus' Ship Bridge - 1150
————————————————————————————

Crewman 1
We have the coordinates
of those recent
dimensional vibrations.
N24, E92, Ignas, in the
Lahan region, the
northeast ocean.
From the wave pattern,
it's definitely a Gatekeeper.

Crewman 2
There are no regular
mainland flights.

Ramsus
"Could it be Shevat's
Aphel Aura?"

Crewman 1
No. The mass is
different. It's a much
smaller pattern.

Crewman 2
I can't believe that
the Lambs have a ship
equipped with a
Gatekeeper. 

Ramsus
"It probably is Kislev's.
The last purge was not 
complete."

Ramsus
"Damn you..."

Grahf
"Shouldn't you pursue?"

Ramsus
"What?"

Grahf
"The one who caused
you so much pain and 
grief is on that ship.
And it's headed for
Aquvy."

Ramsus
"Put all the crew members
on emergency alert. We're
attacking the Kislev ship."

Miang
"We can't, Commander!
We don't have orders 
from the capital yet.
If we move from here..."

Ramsus
"I don't care!
I won't allow them
to escape!"

Grahf
"I believe I already
said your tricks will
do you no good."

Miang
"I'm just trying to help.
Didn't I help get those
'shackles' off?
Now, you know the 'vessel'
will only respond to the
chosen one.
They don't know this.
But...he's necessary for
Kahr.
He's the very meaning of
Kahr's existence."

Miang
"Yes, I must thank you.
After all, you did help
me didn't you?"

Grahf
"..."

Miang
"Was it for me?
Or for him?
...Or...for yourself?"

We will take the boundary
between gates 1 and 2,
it's the shortest way to

Ramsus
"Fine."

Crewman 2
Message from Kelvena.
Dominia is withdrawing
in Haishao. She will
pursue the aerial
battleship.

Gazel Ministry SOL-9000 - 1152
————————————————————————————

Disobedience...
Ramsus' orders are to
excavate the 'Anima
Relics' in Ignas...
and to watch over the
Lambs. What is he...
...

We can recover the
'Anima Relics'
anytime.
Moreover, we learned
that 'he' was on the
transfered ship.
Ramsus was probably
after 'him'.

...
So it was the trauma.

Nay. In this case,
Knigret...
It was the severe
external wounds.

According to the
memory cube...
we've found multiple
subjects around
'him' that possess
the 'Animus' factor.

Is it -Sufradi-,
the subject of
the M Project?

Yes.

Coincidence?

Nay, it is beyond that.
They were either 
attracted to 'him' or...

Unexpectedly, it's
developing into
the same condition
as 500 years ago.

That does not rule out
the possibility he planned
it this way intentionally.

The transfer point
is Aquvy...
It's near the
Thames.

If it is Aquvy,
Krelian's headed that way.

Krelian?
Himself?
What for?

It seems they've found it.
For over 4000 years he
searched for Zeboim's
legacy.

Legacy...
Is that the technology
he was talking about?

Emperor Cain
Yes.

Molecular engineering...
...nanotechnology.
The land of all creations,
the capital of Zeboim
culture...resting beneath
the ocean of Aquvy.
For 19 years, the 'Ethos'
kept it secret.

Is this acceptable,
Cain?

Emperor Cain
"Yes, it will do for now."

19 years...
That coincides with
the time when the earth
shifted...

Indeed.

But, I don't understand.
That technology doesn't
seem that crucial to
us...

He is still a Lamb.
Giving him the ability
to do as he wishes is
questionable.

There are times when
even we do not know
what he is thinking.

Emperor Cain
"Let it be.
I will take
responsibility for that.
On another matter...
Weren't you all going
to...
'eliminate' it?"

It's just
by chance.

It is probable the
location is Ignas.

Anyway, I never
believed it would be
eliminated so easily.

The purge was
a failure.
This shall never
happen again.

If the 'Animus' are
together, it is all
the more reason.

Yes.

Cain, why are YOU so
concerned about it?
To us, 'he' is
insignificant...

It could only be
a poison to us.
It could never
be a remedy.

'Anonelbe'...
You don't still believe
that, do you?

That is merely an
illusion. Not
even an ideal.

The result...
is what I am now. It is
as you see it.

Or rather...
Is it the 'emotion'
you have long
forgotten?

Emperor Cain
"..."

Cain,
we are 'gods'.
