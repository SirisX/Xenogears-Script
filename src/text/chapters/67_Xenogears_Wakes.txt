Dad!!

Fei
"Dad!
Are you okay?
Dad! 
I'm sorry...
this is all my fault..."

Khan
"Fei...?
You've returned to
your own self...
You've become one..."

Fei
"Yes, thanks to you all.
If all of you hadn't
called out to me..."

Khan
"Urgh!"

Fei
"Dad!"

Khan
"Don't worry...
This is good...
This is, after all...I..."

Fei
"Dad?"

Khan
"You and..."

You and I must
become one!!!

Fei
"Huh!?
G, Grahf!?
What's going on...?"

Grahf
"Ha ha...
'I' reached the limit of
the body I possessed, on
that day 3 years ago...
'I' required a body that
would tide me over until
your true awakening.
That is why 'I' acquired
the body of your father.
Regardless of your
awakening, your merging,
and the inherited memories
you had acquired...
...there was no way for
you to know of this, since
you had lost your memory
at that point...
At the point in which 'I'
merged with your father."

Fei
"Impossible...!
What about Wiseman...?
What about father...?"

Grahf
"Of course they were just
parts of me... I couldn't
hold on to Khan totally.
His ego was far stronger
than I imagined. When my
control weakened he showed
himself to you as Wiseman."

Fei
"Arggh..."

Grahf
"You have awakened.
This body is now
useless to me.
Now I must return to
my original body...
the reincarnation of my
body that you inhabit."

Fei
"Stop it...!
Dad...!"

Grahf
"I hear you Fei...
You see, he and I are one.
I am Khan, Khan is me.
He has become one with me,
so you too should open
your heart and unite with
me.
Then we can go on to
eliminate everything!"

Fei
"No...I...can't
...allow...you...to
...control...me!"

————————————————————————————

Grahf
"Hmph.
Protecting your master?
Then so be it.
I'll merge with both you
and your machine then.
Now come, Fei!
Fight me!"

Fei
"It's no use!
I know you're Lacan, and
that you're a part of me.
But that doesn't change
you being my father.
I could never really
fight you!

Grahf
"You're so naive!
Why don't you understand
that your naivety is what
killed Sophia, what killed
your mother 'Karen'?

Fei
"I already know that!
That's why I swore never
to run away again...
...that I must rescue Elly.
So don't get in my way!
Wake up! Open your eyes,
father...-Lacan-!"

Grahf
"If that's the case
..then fight me!
Fight me!!!"

Fei
"I can't!"

Grahf
"I see...
Then there's
no choice."

Fei
"!?"

Grahf
"Since you are so unwilling
to fight, I believe I'll
have to use them as bait."

 ! 

Fei
"Stop it!
Don't we have the same
memories? Can't you also
remember that sadness
you felt way back then?
Why then...why must you
destroy everything?
If we stop Deus, won't
this all be over!?"

Grahf
"You still don't understand
...even after your contact
with the Existence?
I came to understand after
my contact with the
Existence that, even if
Deus was destroyed...
...as long as humans still
inhabit this land, Miang...
Elhaym, will be born time
and again.
Then all living things may
as well perish along with
Deus itself. That's the
only path to freedom.
The path to release us from
the eternal cycles of life,
the tragedies of history
and the spell of fate!
Once I awaken Deus as a
weapon, I'll obliterate
all living things...
Then I'll use your awakened
self and that machine to
return everything to
nothing...
That's what I concluded.
Miang and Elhaym...are not
just Deus' mouthpieces.
That 'woman' is its main
body!
Why can't you see that?"

Fei
"That's not true.
She gave her life for me
by shielding me from harm!
Her eyes weren't Miang's!
Mother came back at the
last moment!
Miang, mother...even Elly,
were all humans born on
this planet!
Deus doesn't matter!
You'll see...
I will bring Elly back!
Father...
No, Grahf -Lacan-! 
If you won't back down..."

Grahf
"Never!"

Fei
"Then I have
no choice...!"

The time has come
to truly become one!

Ω Battle - Fei vs Grahf
————————————————————————————

Grahf
"Nnnuuahh...
Ghaa!"

————————————————————————————

Grahf
"Why don't you
finish me off?
If you don't get
rid of me, then
you cannot get
what you want."

Fei
"It's alright...dad.
I understand.
You are not Grahf.
You are my father.
You and Grahf are one.
Your will and purpose
never change.
I knew that once we fought.
But let's stop now.
Our objectives should be
the same. 
It is the same as our
becoming one.
We don't have to fight."

Fei
"Arrghh!
What...!?
My body...!?"

Grahf
"Zohar is after you!
The last piece to combine
with Deus' system.
It seeks to unify with
you...the first to have
been divided from it."

Fei
"What..!?"

Grahf
"This is what Lacan wanted
all along. After all, I'm
an imperfect existence.
It was inevitable that
it would come to this...
considering what had
happened in the past.
Lacan's imperfect
secondary contact with
the Wave Existence split
his personality into two.
Eventually his body died,
but the original Lacan
transmigrated...
Bringing the destiny of
becoming a Contact with
him, he was reborn as
your present body.
The remaining persona,
just his desires, lived on
seperately by possessing
the bodies of others.
That is Grahf...that is
me.
I may have inherited
Lacan's will, but I'm not
the same as the 'Contact
Lacan'.
It is impossible for me
to make real contact.
There would be no true
melding and release.
Even though our bodies
may be different, I am
still half of you.
That fact remains.
Although I'm imperfect, I
can merge temporarily with
Zohar, and thus may be
able to buy you some time.
This is the only way I
can be one with you."

Grahf
"This is all I can do.
Deus' system will start
to look for you again.
Before then, you have
to destroy the newly
perfected Deus and
this Zohar modifier.
You're the only one
that can destroy the
physical barrier that
encases god's body."

Fei
"Dad!"

Grahf
"As you said, that was
Karen.
Through many generations
Miang is beginning to break
free from her bounds.
Now that Elhaym has merged
with Deus, she has all of
her memories back.
All the memories from her
original birth as the
Contact's complement up to
her current transmigration.
That includes all of the
lives she has lived as
Miang, and her substitutes,
over the centuries.
And of course, that
includes your mother's
memories too."

Fei
"Mother's
memories...?"

Grahf
"Fei, cut away all the
binds on mankind...
You should be able to
do that now. Save her
and all the other women
bound with her!"

I'm begging you Fei...

————————————————————————————

Fei
"What's this...?"

Fei
"This pendant...
Is this Sophia's...
or my mother's...?"

 ?

Fei
"It's nothing...
I'm just talking
to myself.
I'm sorry, for all the
trouble I've caused
everyone.
Thank you all so much!
Anyway, let's get going!
There is little time
left now...for me...
and for our planet!"

Kadomony - 1944
————————————————————————————

Citan
"What is this place...!?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT-

Elly
"The land of genesis, 
Kadomony...
where...everything started.
But why do people have no
memory of this..."

Bart
"What is this place...?"

Billy
"...What is this
divine place?"

Rico
"...What in god's name
is this strange place?"

Emeralda
"...What this place?

Chu-Chu
"What is this place?"

Maria
"...What is this place?"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"This is where it all
started.
This is our genesis!
We...no,
humans were born here."

Fei
"...Long ago, Deus crash-
landed on this planet in an
interplanetary colony ship.
In order to revive itself
someday, Deus detached
the Zohar Modifier's
core...
After this core unit came
down here, a single woman
awoke and arose from out
of it."

Fei
"She's the mother of all
humanity..."

Fei
"After she awoke, she
used all her power to
bear several beings.
These would become the
ancestors of the whole
of humanity."

Fei
"These were the
Emperor and the
Gazel Ministry."

Fei
"Finally, she gave birth
to replicas of herself to
be humanity's caretakers."

Fei
"Two selves... 
The -human- Mother
and the weapon...
The Subject and
the Complement."

Fei
"That is Elly
and...Miang."

Fei
"I, the sole survivor
from the colony ship,
met Elly and...
Everything started
from there..."

Fei
"The land of genesis,
-Kadomony-...
This is that place."

Bart
"Yeah, but Fei...
Even with your shared fate
with Deus, why do you have
such ancient memories...?"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Elly
"...Fei"

Citan
"Even so Fei...
Even with your shared fate
with Deus, why do you have
such ancient memories...?"

Billy
"...But Fei.
Even with an ancient fate,
there's a limit to what
normal people can remember
about the past..."

Rico
"Well, I don't understand
that ancient destiny you
have with Deus...
But even then how do you
remember all these ancient
memories so well?
That just ain't human..."

Emeralda
"...Odd.
Why you have ancient
memory...?"

Chu-Chu
"...Churuly amazing.
Chu-Chu's tribe have 
memory as good as any 
humans, but Fei's is 
churuly amazing!"

Maria
"That is incredible.
That you can clearly 
remember the past so 
long ago, I mean..."

————————————————————————————

Fei
"Usually, human memories
cannot be passed down
through the generations.
Humans do not normally have
the ability to compress and
store memories in their
introns."

Fei
"But Elly and I...
and Miang...
are different."

Fei
"Due to our connection with
the 'Wave Existence'...
That is, due to Zohar's
ability to change possible
phenomena, we can clearly
store data in our introns.
In other words, we can
leave behind memories
to be inherited by our
descendants."

Fei
"Just as the Wave Existence 
is bound inside of Zohar...
the information is affixed
to me, so to speak, by some
of the power of the Wave 
Existence."

Citan
"Then this is...!"

————————————————————————————
-ALT- ???

Elly
"...This is...  
It can't be...?"

Bart
"So this is...!"

Billy
"...So that means
that this is...!?"

Rico
"So you mean to tell me,
that the body in there
is..."

Emeralda
"Fei...
...What's this?"

Chu-Chu
"Wha, what's this then?"

Maria
"So this is...!?"

————————————————————————————

Fei
"This is the form from
when Elly and Miang
were still one being...
This is the first
woman of our world..."

...Our mother...

Yggdrasil IV Bridge? - 1194
————————————————————————————

Bart
"...So if we destroy that
Zohar thing, everything
will be over, right?"

Citan
"Yes.
The source of our Ether
powers, and the source of
power for the generators
that make our Gears work...
It all comes from the
'Zohar Modifier' engine
which can control any
potential phenomena.
If we destroy it,
Deus...
and the -Seraph- angels...
will all be deactivated...
And then we should also be
able to free Elly, who has
become bound to the Deus
weapon system as 'Miang'."

Right, Fei?

Fei
"Yeah.
That's what the 'Wave
Existence' said."

Citan
"But then there is the
downside...
It will also mean that we
will no longer be able to
use our Gears or our Ether
powers anymore."

Rico
"What are those -Seraph-
angels all about anyway?
That odd appearance as if
they lack something...as if
they were neither living
beings nor mere weapons..."

Citan
"Zohar senses the human
consciousness and
incarnates the -Seraphs-."

Billy
"Human consciousness...?"

Citan
"Zohar itself involves the
principle of uncertainty.
The observer's perception
of Zohar determines the
entity it actually becomes.
In other words, I believe
that those angels are
incarnations of the
spirits of people...
...The people who have
been absorbed by Deus to
become parts of it."

Bart
"So what merit is there for
them to gain in eliminating
all of civilization?"

Maria
"Is it some kind of hatred
for those humans who have
survived?"

Citan
"Of course not.
Those people who were
created and assimilated
as parts for Deus would
not have such intentions.
Try to remember what
Elly, when she became
Miang, said."

Fei
" 'The creations of god
   will someday be a
   hindrance...
   That is why they must
   be eliminated...'"

Citan
"Yes. That is why Merkava
is being used to begin the
destruction.
But...Deus is not
following its programming
of exterminating all of
civilization...
The -Seraphs-, which are
terminal interface weapons
of Deus, are using their
bodies composed of...
...nanomachines to absorb
massive numbers of people
regardless of whether
they are dead or alive.
It is not discriminating
between the mutant and 
non-mutant people. This
is highly peculiar...
...The fact that the
people who are meant to
be destroyed are being
taken in as well...
That is the absolute
opposite of what it is
supposed to be doing."

Fei
"Maybe there aren't
enough parts?"

Citan
"That is unlikely.
Aside from those bodies
that were destined to be
parts for it...
...Deus, who has already
acquired the abilities of
the nanomachines, can just
about use any material...
...to construct its body.
It is obvious, it has other
intentions in mind."

Citan
"Those intentions...
Krelian has called Deus
the mother.
If god is the mother, then
those motives are coming
from the Great Mother...
Impeding the growth of its
child, enveloping it, to
bring the child back to the
womb to become one with it.
That is its motive. Such a
program does not exist
within its design though.
It was probably given this
unique will by someone.
Either from Elly who has
merged with the Deus or..."

Fei
"Either way, it doesn't
change the fact that we
have to fight.
Regardless of what their
intentions are.
The problem is how we're
supposed to deal with them.
You think we can do it
in our current state?"

Zephyr
"This secret battleship,
Excalibur, will also take
part in the final battle.
Additionally, the military
potential of all the
surface forces will
assemble here."

Bart
"Even if we can put
together a massive force...
...we still have the
problem with the main
armament of the Merkava.
We need to know how to take
that out. As long as we
don't do that..."

Citan
"Merkava's ultra-long-range
cannon has the ability to
vaporize any substance.
On top of that, they have a
barrier around their
perimeter that nullifies
all attacks."

Zephyr
"We've fought against the
Merkava many times to try
to stop its onslaught.
However, we cannot even
get close. Hence we have
had to withdraw everytime."

Fei
"Dammit!
No matter how much we
want to save Elly...
...if we can't get
inside the Merkava,
it's meaningless."

Sigurd
"To add to that, there
is the problem of those
-Seraphs-.
...They function as the
terminal interfaces weapons
for close defense.
I can easily say that their
attack power is equivalent
to the Omnigear class."

Bart
"They even have the
regenerative ability due
to the nanomachines."

Taura
"Don't be concerned
about that."

Taura
"I was able to obtain some
data from Xenogears...
You see, Xenogears has
mutagenically evolved due
to its contact with Zohar.
Using that data, all of
your new Gears ought to
be completed soon.
Additionally, all the other
weapons and armaments are
being modified to implement
the 'Disassembler-Device'."

Billy
"Disassembler-Device?"

Taura
"In contrast to the Nano-
assemblers, which create
matter to repair with...
...the Disassembers have
the ability to dismantle
or destroy matter.
They can even deactivate
the nanomachines' restoring
ability by disengaging
their repair programs.
This should be sufficiently
effective even against the
Deus' -Seraphs-."

Fei
"Alright, even if we can
deal with the angels...
...just how are we gonna
deal with that Merkava?
We can't even get close
to the thing..."

Citan
"There is no such thing
as a perfect defense.
There is a way."

Citan
"Look over here."

Merkava's main gun requires
a 1.2 second interval to
reload because of its
tremendous output.
Upon firing, although it
is only sectional, there
will be a portion of the
barrier that will be opened.
There is a 1.87 second
delay before the barrier
reforms in that area. If
we can use this window of
time to target and destroy
that cannon, it will be
possible to close in on it.
If we can get close enough,
we can break through with
gravitational-spatial
correction.

Citan
"Well, this is the
rough idea."

Sigurd
"Unfortunately we don't
have such a long range
cannon...
...that could acquire
a target in such
a brief time frame."

Bart
"So what you're sayin' is
we just need to shut that
annoying cannon up, right?"

Fei
"...You want to
go head on into
Merkava!?"

Billy
"Now you're being reckless
again... That's suicide."

Bart
"No, listen. We're not
going to just rush in.
The Yggdrasil IV and
this Excalibur are also
equipped with barriers.
That's what we'll use.
Although only for a short
time, we can withstand a
direct hit from Merkava's
main cannon.
Then we can close in and
watch for that part of the
barrier to go down and
then destroy the cannon."

Fei
"How long will our
barrier last?"

Bart
"About 20 or so seconds."

Fei
"That's all? It wouldn't
matter how fast we fly.
In that amount of time,
we'll be without a barrier
before we can get within
firing range.
And those numbers are valid
only if the generator is at
full drive, right?
You can only get those
numbers if we sacrifice
all other output and
propulsion."

Bart
"I'm not suggesting we go
in with guns blazing
knowing we're gonna lose.
We're going to physically
put a lid on it,
directly!!"

 ? 

Bart
"As you've said...
The Yggdrasil IV or
Excaliber's barrier can't
sufficiently defend against
Merkava's attack.
At least with one
generator that is..."

Billy
"Meaning...?"

Bart
"Meaning, we can defend
against the Merkava with
twice the amount of time...
...40 seconds, if we couple
the 2 generators together.
This way, we can make it
into the heart of Merkava."

Maison
"Then, what about the
propulsion..."

Bart
"Just hear me out."

This is what we do...
First we transform my Yggdrasil
into heavy assault mode and
load it onto the Excalibur so
we can couple the generators.

By doing that, we can
reduce the energy usage
down to just supporting
the hull of the ship and
generating the barrier.
This will allow most of
the energy to be devoted
to generating the barrier.
Next, shift the barrier to
full front and focus it to
a single point where their
main cannon will make its
strike.

Now for movement.
First off, we develop
a barrier by engaging
Excalibur's generator
to maximum power.
For propulsion during that
time, we'll install on the
Yggdrasil those large solid
rockets we got from the
ruins of the Mass-driver.

When Excalibur's barrier
expires, we'll use the
Yggdrasil IV's generator
to develop a barrier.
Then we'll also detach
the solid rockets and
shift the Excalibur into
conventional flight.

Using this method, we can
get right in Merkava's
face. After it fires,
it'll be defenseless.
During this time, we'll
block the muzzle of
Merkava's cannon with
Excalibur's bow ram.
Upon which, we should
have 0.67 seconds...

With the cannon fire of the
Excalibur, we'll destroy the
Yggdrasil IV's slave
generator and incapacitate
the Merkava along the way,
and then...we breakthrough!

Bart
"...That's what the plan
is all about.
The combination of the
barriers of both ships...
Storming the Merkava...
The timing of the cannon
fire of the Excalibur...
These are all going to
be crucial.
Mess up any one of these
and the consequences are
going to be severe.
Hence, it'll be necessary
to have both crews in
synch with each other.
That's why I'd like to
place Sig in command of
the Excalibur."

Sigurd
"I have no qualms
with that..."

Bart
"What do you think, Queen?
Will you lend us your
battleship?"

Zephyr
"Since there appears to
be no other alternative,
let us go with that.
Please use it as you
see fit."

Citan
"But are we not cutting it
uncomfortably close...?
...When you calculate the
arrival time and the
barrier generation time,
you will see what I mean!
One minor mishap will put
us in a situation where we
could run out of barrier
power before our arrival."

Sigurd
"Also, we will be devoting
both generators to keeping
the barriers up...
Won't that leave us
without perimeter
defenses?
We won't stand a chance
if we get engaged by the
-Seraph- angels on our
way to Merkava."

Fei
"We'll hold them off.
You can count on us!
You guys just concentrate
on taking out that main
cannon."

Bart
"Thanks.
We're depending on you."

Fei
"Already, everywhere
else has been taken out.
This is the only place
that's left. This is
going to be the true
'final battle'."

Billy

Citan
"Oh no!
I should have known better.
What a miscalculation!!
The explosion was too big.
It reacted with the main
condenser right under
the main cannon...
...and induced a
secondary explosion...
How could I have been
so stupid!?"

Bart
"You mean,
we overdid it!?"

Citan
"Why did I not
realize it sooner!?
This means...
We might have...
Oh no, Elly...!"

Fei
"Oh...oh my gosh...
Elly...!!"

Billy
"W,what is it,
this time?"

Bart
"Hey, Citan!
What more is going
to happen!?"

Citan
"Something is happening in
the center of Merkava...
What could it be...!?"

Fei in The Chair - 1840

At that time, the earth
quaked and shook. And,
from the location where
the Merkava crashed, a
giant object appeared.
 
It was Deus' final form.
 
The Merkava was merely
its vessel.
Deus evolved through
the use of Krelian's
nanomachines into a
planetary scale weapon
and began terraforming.

It was attempting to
convert this entire
planet into a weapon...
 
We retreated back to the
base at the snow plains
to form a new strategy...
 
We decided to go back into
Deus. Time was running out
for us.

Shevat Man
Though this base is the
last refuge for humans...
as you can no doubt see we
have almost no supplies.
Anyway, we're using a
fallen piece of Shevat
as the main base...
But you probably could
have guessed that, huh.
If we can take out Deus
even one day sooner...
We can't hold out much
longer like this.

Hey-hey, welcome.
What can I do for

Hey, thanks.

Hey, aren't these Picotiles

Wanna buy my Picotiles?
    Buy Picotiles!

Alright!
20000G for the lot!
And no haggling for a
discount! So pay up!

Forced to pay 20000G.

Thanks.
They're really delicious
if you grill them...

Aaaaaaaah...!!

If you give it to me,

I'm sure something
good will come up.
How about it?

Hand over Gold Nugget?
    Hand it over

I'm a celebrated Gear
weapons specialist...
But lately there's been
no interesting work...
There are no men with
enough guts to ask me
to forge them a weapon
to fight Deus...
If you bring me a nifty
sword, I can forge it into
something truly amazing
for you, anytime...
But I won't work for
anyone rude enough
to ask me to check a
weapon while it's still
equipped to their Gear!

Ohh...the Kishin!
You sure have a
novel sword.
Looks interesting!
Lemme take a peek!

This came out great!
It was like turning
plowshares into a
sword!
Use this sword and
make Deus and his
legions pay!

'Kishin' sword was enhanced!

Received 'Kijin' sword!

Dan
"In the prison, when I saw
you change into a monster,
I understood everything.
Living inside of you, Fei,
there is a monster that's
not you... He's the bad
one... He's to blame..."

Dan
"So...to forgive you, or
not to forgive you... Well
...that's not the problem!
It's not like it's gonna
turn back things the way
they were...but...
errh, it's just...
I don't know how to say it
properly, but I'm sorry...
I...I, errh...
I...!"

Fei
"It's alright, Dan.
...Enough already.
I understand.
It is my fault.
I'm sorry I caused
you such pain..."

Dan
"..."

Fei
"I'm just glad that I could
finally make peace with
you. Take care, kiddo."

Midori
"Fei...
I was scared a little,
but not really scared.
Cause I knew that inside
of that monster, you were
doing all you could to
fight it, Fei. I knew it."

Fei
"Midori! I had better give
this back to you... It's 
your precious ring, right?
Be a good little girl,
and listen to your mother,
Yui, alright, Midori!
Oh and...
look after Dan
for me, OK!?"

Midori
"Yep, we, 
are all fine.
Fei, you be
careful too.
I'm sure your
voice will reach
her too, Fei..."

Fei
"Yeah...
I guess you're right!"

Fei
"Okay...
Well, I'm going now.
So see you later!"

Midori
"Here...
I got this

Fei, you can

I'll trade you

"The snow keeps falling...

Our sorrow, our defilement,

things as easily as that...
What have we...have I...
been doing...
been pursuing...
for these past 500 years?"

Zephyr
"By the way...
How is the person you
rescued from Merkava?
I heard he recovered
consciousness..."

Citan
"Yes, well, at first, he
had lost faith in himself
but now he is better.
Kahr has revived himself,
and has found some real
meaning in his life.
If he decides to fight on
our side then our total
fighting power shall be
greatly increased."

"Trash...
Reject...
You can take pity and call
yourself that all you want,
but what about them!?"

Citan
"Are these women stupid,
or trash, or rejects too
for believing in you?
The reasons why you helped
the girls, who had no one
to turn to, may not have
been that noble...
But in spite of that,
they stuck with you.
Do you know why?"

They know you better than
anybody else. They know
the true kindness that
exists inside your heart.
They know because they
want to be loved.
That is why they won't
leave you.
Kahr...
Do not make them into the
trash or rejects that you
speak of.

Fei
"Perhaps..."

Zephyr
"Fei...
May I ask you something?
About Elly...
What if, even if we break
Zohar's spell, she doesn't
return to normal..."

Fei
"Elly will be back to
her usual self! I will
go on believing that.
But even if that doesn't
happen...I will still...
...Well, let's just say
I'm prepared for that too!"

Zephyr
"You don't have to do
this if you don't want
to, you know.
Your opponent is the
person you love...
If you decide to quit now,
no one will blame you."

Fei
"To quit would be
meaningless.
All that I have fought for,
and all that I live for,
would come to have no
meaning at all...
People should be free. With
no one bound by others, and
no one binding others...
Inside of me, there is a
part of me that desires
that freedom, and a part
of me that gives me hope.
So, I shall fight to
win true freedom!
For we are still alive!
We fight to live.
That is the reason
why I fight.
It's proof I'm human.
I promised my father, and
myself too, that I would
free Elly from Deus' binds,
that I would save her..."

Zephyr
"I understand.
So, let's keep believing...
And hope for a miracle..."

Little Girl 1
It's not bad. There are
a lot of people, and it's
fun to play in the snow.

Woman 1
After losing our home in
Kislev...we lost our home
in Aveh, too. So we decided
to stay here for a while.
But next time, I want to
live somewhere that's green.

Man 1
I never thought I'd live
here...I wanted to make
my parents happy.

Little Girl 2
It's tremendously lonely
without cats.

Woman 2
We had a hard time
evacuating because my
daughter begged us to take
all the cats with us.

Man 2
This isn't bad at all
compared to military camp
and the cat house.

Old Man
I don't know why but
recently, families
keep increasing.

Old Woman
I wasn't planning on living

Man 1
...It's a different system
from what humans have been
creating. In other words,
it should be called a
machine made by non-humans.

Man 2
It wasn't made by humans.
That I can see. But what I
want to know is if it's a
machine to begin with.

Man 1
Be quiet!
Sister!
Please take the
children elsewhere.

Nun 1
You want the children to
stand in the cold hallway!?
This is the warmest room.
Why can't they stay here?

Man 1
We're having a very
important meeting.
They're disturbing us.

Nun 2
Please don't get so upset.
I really appreciate that
you're trying to protect
us.
But you know those people
are the only ones who can 
change our fate...
don't you?

Man in red robe
There may be a few things
we can do.
But I've been a soldier
all my life.
I can't sit still as
long as there are
people to protect and
enemies to fight.

I am Yggdrasil X!
Come on! Catch me
if you can!

Child 2
Hey!

Man in turban
I'm prepared to protect
everyone here.

Imperial Guard 1
I want to help people.
But all I know how to
do is fight.

Imperial Guard 2
I had doubts about fighting
before, but not about
protecting the people here.

Aveh Soldier 1
You think it's just going to
sit there while we gather
all of Aveh's and Kislev's
armies...?

Aveh Soldier 2
Really, how can we fight
against an enemy like that?

Little Boy 1
This is the first time
I've seen snow.
It's so light and white,
and a beautiful pattern
appears for an instant
then it melts on my palm.
It's amazing...

Little Girl 1
I wanna see my mom and dad.

Aveh Soldier 3
The children are annoying,
but, they're the reason
why I'm here.

Little Boy 2
What is it?
Can I do that too?

Imperial Guard 2
Kids are all the same
in Kislev, Aveh and Nisan.

Little Girl 2
Her outfit is so cute,
isn't it?

Dragon Girl
My grandma made this for
my mom when she was a
child. It's really warm.

Demi-human Boy
Good luck to you too.
I...will protect these
people, so don't worry.

Mole Man
Uh...I'll play with
the sister.

Nun 1
Now more than ever I feel
as if each child is very
important.

Nun 2
We both no longer have
anything to lose.
Do as you wish.
I hope you'll have
help from heaven.

It doesn't matter whether
it's a machine or a

"The Thames...
sank.
The 'Angels' attacked...
The Thames withstood the
onslaught of Reapers, but
was defenseless against
those 'Angels'...
Hardly anyone got out in
time... They went down
with the Thames..."

Bart
"Wha...wait a minute.
What about the Captain?
He's okay, right?"

Fei
"What...? By the way,
where is the Captain?
What happened to him?"

watch the end of the Thames
with his own eyes..."

Fei
"So, what's happened with
you lately. I didn't know
you had a son?
The kid who just left...
seemed pretty angry about
something."

Hans
"I'm embarrassed you just
saw that.
I got married just before
the Thames went down."

Hans
"Her name is Anna. She's
my wife. She was saved by
the Thames when the ships
were attacked by Reapers.
Unfortunately, that's when
she lost her husband...
Don't misunderstand me.
It wasn't out of feeling
sorry for her or anything
like that... Or...
Well, perhaps it was...
I just wanted to protect
her, that's all. If you
call that feeling sorry,
then I suppose I don't
mind.
The Captain teased me
mercilessly. He said...
 'What! A cold guy like
 you, seducing a widow?
 Just make sure the kid
 doesn't hate you...'
Ha, ha... I guess the
Captain was right.
My stepson doesn't like
me yet. 
But I'm hoping someday..."

Fei
"I see...
Boy, you've changed!"

Hans
"Ha, ha. You've changed
too, Fei. I don't know
how to explain it, but...
As for me...well, I don't
know what it is...
I guess I've always had
someone protecting me..."

Fei
"Hans..."

Hans
"Fei, I believe..."

Hans
"I believe that one day,
the Captain will come
down that stairway...
Tap-tap-tapping
with his cane..."

Hans
"And he'll say...
 'Haaaans! It looks like
 we'll get our hands on
 a priceless treasure!
 What kind of face is
 that? You don't believe
 me, huh? This time it's
 true...honest!'"

Hans
"...Maybe
someday..."

Captain
"Haaaans! It looks like
we'll get our hands on

face is that!?"

"Ca, ca, cap..."

Cut it out, you fool!"

you all along.

This time it's true!
It's an island with
buried treasure.
It's called 'Duneman
Isle'.
An ancient hero defeated
a monster there, and now
legend has it, his fabled
sword rests there."

Hans
"What info. do you have...?
Do you know where the place
is? What about a ship?"

Captain
"Don't know where it is!
Don't have a ship!
Don't worry with details!
Don't you know that
attitude of yours is why
that kid won't take to
you?"

Hans
"That's none of
your business!"

Captain
"Well, by the time that
kid actually decides to
like you...
I'll have managed to get
a new ship. Till then,
give it all for your
family, lad!!
Give your family the

Zeboim Room - 1388

 "A discussion on the
excavated Slave Generators 
and their special effects"
 Strange engines discovered
in structures buried under-
ground in ancient times, the
"Sub-" or "Slave Generators"
(hereafter abbreviated as 
"S.G."'s) have, after diverse
study, become widely known to
have their output divided
into 3 levels.
However, it has been
ascertained that a higher
mode exists that far surpasses
these output levels.
 For convenience's sake we 
shall call this 'Hypermode'.
Hypermode is invoked at a
certain probability when an
S.G.'s attack level reaches
three. The explanation below
covers the various conditions
and probabilities for
invocation, that we have been
able to ascertain at present,
assuming that a S.G. has been
installed into a humanoid
fighting machine (or "Gear").
In all cases, a basic
constant exists, which we
observe to be approximately
the value of 5. 
The probability is computed
by multiplying this constant
by one tenth of the
percentage that the HP have
been reduced.
For example, if a Gear's HP
has been reduced by 50% of
its total, then the chance of
invocation would be
     5 x 50/10 = 25 (%)
 So in this case, when the
Attack Level reaches 3,
there is a 25% chance that
Hypermode will set into
motion.
Also, apart from this, there
are modification values,
which are added to the basic
value accordingly with the 
release of each attack from 
levels 1 to 3.
 In other words, the chances
of Hypermode being invoked 
increases the more a Gear 
attacks and the more the Gear
is attacked.
The S.G.'s Hypermode induced
by the aforementioned
probability can emit
immeasurable amounts of
energy, so from that aspect
may appear ideal for use as
the master-engine of a
fighting machine.
However, in reality they
have not yet progressed
to the level of use as power
for actual warfare due to
reasons such as their
unpredictability and
the fact that no Gear-frame
exists that is rigid enough
to possibly endure these
energy emissions.

What's this movie...?

A record of the Zeboim
culture that died out
4000 years ago.

Stop it!
Who is this woman...?

Miang, as she appeared
in the Zeboim era.
But I don't know who
her host body was.
She resided at the side
of the  Prime Minister,
manipulating the world
behind the scenes.

To resurrect Deus?

In the beginning, yes.
But later it was different.
Many people then, couldn't
have children. They were
defective humans...
So...she did it over again.

Right before man was about
to be killed out by war, a
new being was born to foster
the next generation.
Remember the missiles in
the Mass-driver facility?
That was the most important
thing to the Zeboim people.
Because of that, we now are
descendants of the few
strong people who survived.

Fei
"A slipping economy...
Rising crime...
Urban blight...
A nation of fanatics
looking for their own
living space...
...believing in religious
sect leaders and gathering
around totalitarian rulers.
These people were cut off
from the next generation
thanks to genetic damage...
...and would have died out,
if left to their own
devices.
So, Elly and I took the
hopes of the people and
created Emeralda..."

Kim
"Think about it.
What's the purpose of
fighting each other on
such a tiny planet as
this?
Fighting out of fear
of being hunted into
a corner...
Rushing in to fight as
if there were only so
many 'reserved seats'
to the right of life..."

Kim
"Starting a war is stupid.
Inciting it is also stupid.
Killing people as an act of
terrorism or as a protest
against wars that kill
people is just as stupid.
You're all fools!"

Elly
"...Kim, I felt sorry for
that child.
But I don't think people
in Ravine destroyed the

intention.
They don't have any other

The government is the one
to blame."

"Is that a good enough
reason for that child,
or those dead people?
It wasn't much of an
operation. It was
difficult but there was
enough chance to win...
We'd have won if we had 
better equipment...
That child would have
been saved if there
was electricity..."

Kim
"It's not just that child.
Five people died in my 
hospital.
The ICU didn't function..."

Kim
"Stupid. Just fools.
Humans, creatures are
meant to live.
Why do they want to
die out?
Why do they strangle
themselves?
Humans are defective
creatures.
A bunch of fools!
That's why genetic damage
is up lately. The birth
rate is also going down.
Only 30 years to live...
Nature, this planet, won't

Sigurd
"Deus integrated with
Zohar and awoke...
But we've found out Deus
is in the center of the
giant structure created
out of the fallen Merkava.
The only way we can think
of to destroy Deus is to
penetrate into there and
make our way to the center.
That structure used to be
Merkava itself, but we
must assume the inside has
changed significantly.
We don't know what dangers
await inside of there.
Please be very careful.

"Yeah, thanks Sigurd.
Let me take care of it.
I will destroy Deus.

If you destroy Deus...
...the proliferation of the
nanomachines that are out
to turn this planet itself
into a weapon will stop...
But, if you end up losing
Elly who was united with
Deus for that very purpose,
then what good will it be?"

Fei
"But..."

Sigurd
"That's right, Fei.
She's our friend who's been
through a lot with us too.
I think that saving a dear
friend is just as important
as protecting our planet or
saving the world...
What better reason is there
to fight? If you can't even
save your friends, then how
could you save the world?
Don't you agree?"

Bart
"Yeah, Sig's right!
Don't you ever give up,
Fei, no matter what!
You're the only one
who can release Elly
from Deus' spell.
But, we'll give you as
much backup as we can.
So..."

them all over again.
Wanna see my notes?
    Let me see them
    Not right now

1) The <T> button is the
   accelerator.
   It moves you forward
   really fast!!
2) If you press the
   Directional button with
   the <T> button held down,
   you can...
 go down by pressing Up,
 go up by pressing Down,
 and change direction by
 pressing Left or Right.
3) When you want to turn
 quickly, also press the
 L1 button for left, or
 the R1 button for right.
4) You can reverse by
   pressing the R2 button.
5) Press the <S> button
   to go to the bridge.
   Press the <C> button
   to land.
 But note...
 There are places where
 you cannot land, such as
 mountains and forests.
 But then again that was
 the same conditions the
 Yggdrasil had when it
 was a Sand Cruiser.

I can't wait until I become

Tech 1
This is Xenogears.
It is Fei's Gear.
Height 19.8 sharls
Base Weight 18.9 kahnns
Full Weight 21.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.
Weltall-2 was
transformed after its
contact with Zohar.
Detailed specs cannot be
ascertained by the
measuring devices here.
But then again, I wonder
whether this Gear has a
limited ability to measure
at all?
It almost seems that this
Gear gets stronger and
stronger as Fei's mental
powers increase...
Anyhow, the engine seems
to have been left in there
from before, so it should
require fuel as before...
But it wouldn't surprise
me if this thing doesn't
actually need fuel anymore!

Tech 2
This is Andvari,
the young master's Gear...
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior...
They made it using the data
on the Omnigear left by Roni
Fatima, an ancestor of the
young master, and the data
obtained from Xenogears.
It is a combination of the
latest Gear technology and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.
Even when it was found
hidden in the underground
in Nisan, its basic weapon
equipment was the whip.
That must mean, the young
master's ancestors must've
used whips and rods too...
I guess it's in the blood,
huh!?

Tech 3
This is Fenrir,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.
Height 18.6 sharls
Base Weight 17.2 kahnns
Full Weight 20.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior.
They used the data from the
Omnigear, Fenril, brought
from Solalis by the Doctor,
and Fei's Xenogears.
It is a union of Gear and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.
The default equipment is
the sword...which seems
to be the doctor's weapon
of choice.

Tech 4
This is Stier-2.
It is Rico's Gear.
Height 19.2 sharls
Base Weight 22.2 kahnns
Full Weight 26.7 kahnns
Like the other Omnigears,
it was at one point an Anima
Relic absorbed by Deus and
deactivated...
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar
and Mechior, reconstructed it.
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.
Its standard weapon is the
same as it was before its
reconstruction.

Tech 5
Renmazuo2
This is Billy's Gear.
Height 18.8 sharl
Base Weight 14.9 kahnns
Full Weight 19.3 kahnns
Like the other Omnigears it
was at one point an Anima
Relic that was absorbed by
Deus and thus deactivated.
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar and
Mechior could reconstruct it.
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.
The standard weapon is the
same as before reconstruction.
Billy's father's Buntline
Cannon can still be used too.

Tech 6
Crescens
It's Emeralda's Gear.
Height 15.4 sharl
Base Weight 9.7 kahnns
Full Weight 13.3 kahnns
This Gear's controls are
quite unique.
The colony of nanomachines
from Emeralda's body
physically merges with the
Gear for direct control.
Theoretically, this Gear
shouldn't require repairs
but it seems they don't try
to repair anything except
Emeralda herself.
So, we're left with no
other choice but to have
to maintain the Gear.
The surface hovering and
flight capabilties are
quite impressive.

Taura
"Thanks for visiting.
You're looking mighty
healthy.
I want to help you more...
but this body can't survive
unless it breathes the air
here...
Looks like I'm just about
ready to meet my maker,
huh...
Ho, hoh, hoh!"

Oh, Taura...

Taura
"Don't worry, I'll stop my
moaning. Besides, I have a
nice present for you."

Former Imperial City Guard
"What inhumed our world that
day was...an angel...a, a
so-called messenger of god ?
My sister, my mother, my 
father...they are all dead!
I, I am a soldier of the 
military empire of Kislev!
And yet, ...and yet, ...and
yet, I could do nothing!!!
Damn it! ...Damn everything!"

Big Joe
"Destruction was poured out
onto our entire world...
Death poured down on all 
the living...
It was fate,
unavoidable fate!

Big Joe
Allow me to show my 
appreciations for all 
you have done fellas.
I brought this here from the
Wildcat bar in what was the
Imperial capital Nortune.
I also fixed it up a little.
It should be a lot more
friendlier now. But you'll
never know unless you try,
so give it a listen, huh!
It was hard to get rid of
the elegant old grain look
it had when placed in the
'Wildcat', but...
well, anyway, don't you
think the new faux marble
design is kinda groovy?"

Amazoness 1
"The continent of Ignas
and its countries...
the Empire of Kislev and
the Kingdom of Aveh...
these all no longer exist.
Our world lost such names
on that day... The survivors
have gathered in the snow
field far to the south...
It's 'the last stand of the
living'!"

Amazoness 2
"I abandoned this place
once, but it's the city
in which I was born!
I can't turn my back on
it that easily!
That's why I came back...
Back to what was once the
Imperial Capital.
Even if destruction was to
come on this world, I'd go
on protecting it!

Diana
"From that day on, peace
has disintegrated.
But, we are alive...
That's a truth that can't
be changed.
It's not that everything
has ended.
Our planet has just returned
to its original state...
And we are still alive.
All has not been lost..."

Diana
"Looking at your eyes, I
know you too haven't lost
your hope...      
Hehe...
I remember the day you came
to the Imperial Capital."

Battler
"Oh, so you too heard the 
rumors and came to try out
Battling, here, at this 
place once known as Kislev?
The world has been shattered
by angels of death but we
still live on like this.
This is not the end for us!"

Battler
"I'm a 'Battler', a warrior!
I'll fight, fight, fight on
to the end, unto death do
me part!"

"We went through a
lot together...
But this one's going to
be really tough...
But, we won't die! 
We'll come back alive!
I'll be asking you to
join me again when
this is all over!"
