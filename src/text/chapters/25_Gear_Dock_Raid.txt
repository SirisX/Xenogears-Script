Fei
"Who are you?"

Battler
"Don't be so cruel.
We've been waiting for you."

Citan
"Waiting?
For......us?"

Battler
"Please,
come with us..."

Fei
"...This isn't going to
be another stupid 'Baptism
Ceremony' is it?"

Amazoness
"Hey, hey,
wait a minute!"

Amazoness
"We're not trying to pick a
fight. Keep talking like
that and there's bound to be
a misunderstanding.
Leave this to me..."

Battler
"Right, sorry."

Citan
"...Well, I assume
you are not hostile..."

Fei
"..."

Amazoness
"...Not here.
Let's go somewhere else.
Come, follow me."

Citan
"It seems we have
no choice.
Shall we go Fei?"

Battling Champ - Kislev - Champ's Room - 1042
————————————————————————————

Fei
"So... what do you
want with us?"

Amazoness
"The Champ...no I mean...
Rico needs your help."

Citan
"Help the Champion...?"

Fei
"Hang on,
what do you mean?"

Battler
"Y'know what just happened...
The special broadcast on the
dorm's vid by the Committee!"

Battler
"Yeah, y'know, the broadcast
said somthin' like this...
This evening, the former
Champion was found guilty
of attempting to assassinate
the Kaiser, as well as
breaking Imperial Code
section B..."

Thus, a public execution
will be held at the arena..."

Fei
"Yes, I know he got caught,
and was arrested...
But, what's this about an
attempted assassination
of the Kaiser!?"

Battler
"Those committee members...
The Champ probably got in
their way somehow..."

Citan
"...The Battling
Committee?"

Amazoness
"The Battling Committee is
made up mostly of people
from the 'Ethos'.
They used to have a lot of
pull in the government...
But the current Kaiser,
Sigmund, ousted almost all
of the 'Ethos' influence
from the government."

Battler
"On top of that, these
past few years...
In order to strengthen the
military or something, the
Kaiser has started to
interfere with the Battling
operated by the 'Ethos'."

Battler
"The Kaiser probably got in
the way of them operating
the Battling smoothly.
So, they used the Champ..."

Fei
"Why Rico...?"

Amazoness
"Rico was originally
born in this town...
But because Sigmund whipped
up anti-demihuman sentiment
Rico was chased out of this
town when he was young."

Amazoness
"So Rico hated the Kaiser,
the capital Nortune, and
the whole Kislev Empire."

Fei
"And that's why they
went after Rico..."

Battler
"In the past, the Champ has
had many chances to kill
the Kaiser.
That the earlier crash into
the box seat was disguised
as an accident..."

Amazoness
"But that failed too.
The committee, fearing
being exposed, used
Rico..."

Battler
"The Champ is being
manipulated by the
committee.
Please, Fei!
Help the Champ."

Battler
"Now, you are the
Battling Champ, but
our Champ is...

Hammer
"B,b, bro-!!
Are you he-re?"

Hammer
"The supply train times,
dates and destinations!
I got them all... no prob!"

Hammer
"...Wha?
Hey bro, what are you
doing talking with them?"

Fei
"Hold on a minute.
Hammer, tell me about 
those supply trains."

Hammer
"Huh?
Is it...alright?
With these outsiders...?"

Citan
"It is alright,
they are our friends."

Hammer
"Oh, really?
Well, okay...
The next supply train's
operating date is...
tonight!
But...
if that's too soon,
then the next one is..."

Fei
"Hammer, did you say that
a supply train will pass
by here tonight?"

Hammer
"What? Tonight?
Well there are trains
passing through...
Um, but bro...
we need a thorough plan.
Tonight is impossible!"

Fei
"The situation has changed,
and so have our plans.
We move tonight!!"

Hammer
"We move tonight...?
What the...?
Are you serious?"

Citan
"... Did you hear any
interesting tidbits of
information outside?"

Hammer
"Well...the dorms are in
an uproar over that Master
Rico thing..."

Citan
"Do you know any details?
Rico is to be executed at
the arena, tonight, right?"

Hammer
"Master Rico's going
to be executed...
is this true?"

Fei
"Didn't you say there
was one more route?"

Hammer
"Huh? Oh yeah, you mean
via the arena, right...
Bro! You're not thinking..."

Fei
"Yes I am thinking
exactly that!
You said it may be
possible to get out 
through the Battling 
Arena, right?"

Citan
"I see! Then we 
probably can help
the Champion..."

Fei
"Doc."

Citan
"Hmm...
It might just work!"

Hammer
"Wait a minute!
Might just work...?
You don't intend to
just go bursting into
the arena, do you?"

Fei
"Either way, we were going
to escape via the arena, so
it's on our way... right!?"

Amazoness
"Then that means...?"

Fei
"No problem. It's just one
more thing to do on the way
to getting my Gear back..."

Citan
"Leave the rest to us.
And I would like you all to
go to the arena tonight.
We will leave Nortune, but
if they think you were all
involved with us, I do not
know what they might do..."

Battler
"We're counting on you
...for the Champ's sake."

Amazoness
"Sorry, we had to ask
you to do this..."

Battler
"We really appreciate 
what you're doing...
Here...
Please take this."

Received 2000G!

Fei
"Hammer, you hide
yourself somewhere.
When we get out into the
arena, I'm just going to
go wild in my Gear...
We'll play it by ear from
there to escape from the
Imperial capital...
You got it, Hammer?"

Hammer
"I got you, bro!
Show them your stuff
for me too, bro!"

Fei
"There is still some
time until the train
passes by..."

Citan
"Well, if everything is
ready then, why not
take a light nap?"

Battler 1
There's a rumor that, behind
the scenes, the 'Ethos' is
actually involved with the
'B-Info. Center'.
Officially the 'Battling
Committee' is run by the
Imperial capital, but it
too is rumored to be an 
agent of the 'Ethos'.

Of course this is all gossip!

Battler 2
It seems that after the bout,
the former champ's Gear moved
on it's own accord and crashed 
right into the Kaiser's stand!
The pilot, Rico, was not found
within the Gear, so they put
it down to the machine going
out of control!

Battler 3
I am glad that that sewer
monster affair is over.
Now I can get back to work!

Informer
The new doctor that came
after that lady doctor got
put in charge of civilians,
barely works here anymore!
It's got to the point that
if you get injured you have
to buy Aquasol with your
own money and cure yourself!
Where did he go to?
Oh, and don't you think he
looks a lot like the guy
that hangs around the Champ?

    Don't
    Rest

Citan
"No time for that.
We must hurry..."

————————————————————————————

Citan
"Hold on, Fei.
Are you fully prepared?
You know there is no
turning back now."

Fei
"Huh? Yeah, you're right."
    Go get prepped
    I'm ready 
	
————————————————————————————

Citan
"...Good.
Shall we go?
There is not much time."

Citan
"...There is still some
time before the train
arrives... Let us rest
here for a while."

Amazoness
"...Sorry.
I...can't go in the arena.
No matter what you say,
I can't.
Well it's time...
Tonight's train will be
coming through here...
I wish you success.
Maybe...we can meet again."

Kislev Train Tunnel - 1000

Citan
"Whew, that was a close
one! We almost got thrown
off."

Fei
"It's all because of
those mischievous punks!
When the old man's gone
they always do this.
Oh well."

Citan
"Kind of odd hearing that
from a mischievous 'you
know who'."

Fei
"Huh? You say 
something?"

Citan
"Well, anyway we should
be alright if we take
this all the way.
As for the mission,
so far so good."

Fei
"What's that sound?"

Citan
"The connector...!
Fei, hurry up
and jump off!!"

Citan
"This train is almost
falling apart.
That was another close one."

Fei
"What if it derails
before we get to
the Gear dock..."

!!

Citan
"This car is unstable too.
Let us get to the front!!"

Citan
"One disaster after
another..."

Fei
"Pretty unreliable
train."

Citan
"The entrance to the
ventilation shaft
that leads to the Gear dock
should be
coming up soon."

Citan
"Here we go!!"

Officer 1
Everyday work, work, work.
Doesn't anything fun ever
happen around here?

Officer 2
No doubt...
That last champion looks
like he's been matched with
the beast.

Now that's something.
Let's get this work done
and go check it out.

Yeah. We need to do
that, we've been workin'
too much lately.

————————————————————————————
???

It is locked.

It is already unlocked.

Used the Master Key.

You have no key.

"There seem to be people.
It may be best not to go
in through here..."

Officer
Hey, make sure you
return the Master Key back
to the shelf.

Guard 1
Yes, sir.

This should do it...

Guard 2
Heeeey, did ya'll hear?
The battle between the
ex-Champ and the beast
is about to begin.

Officer
Oh, it's already
starting. There's no way
we can miss this.

————————————————————————————

 Received Master Key.

Citan
"Hey...Fei, wait a
minute."

Fei
"What's wrong, doc?"

Citan
"This is a part that
allows a Gear to recover
30% of its HP. 
If you have this equipped,
you can activate this
during battle. It is a
highly useful item but
the drawback is that you
will use fuel, so you must
use it with caution."

Fei
"That really doesn't
matter unless we get
back the Gear, doc.
There's no one here so
let's hurry up and get
out of here."

Citan
"Uh, oh yes. My usual
habit...
Well, we should take
it anyway since we
have the chance."

 Received Frame HP30.

Oh...well whatever.

No one is here.
