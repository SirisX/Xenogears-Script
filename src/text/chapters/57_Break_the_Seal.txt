Break the Seal - Elly in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

In order to disperse the nano-
machines, Emeralda and I headed
for one of the ruins of the
Zeboim civilization...
the Mass-driver facility.

————————————————————————————

Fortunately, the facility was
still active which allowed us
to proceed on to the central
control room with little
difficulty.

Along the way we saw various
missiles and giant rockets
that were created during the
Zeboim era...
They stood like tombstones
of that ancient civilization.
 
It was a graveyard for a race
of people who destroyed each
other over pride and arrogance.

Once arriving at the
central control room,
we met up with Citan
who helped us activate
the Mass-driver.
 
We succeeded in launching
the capsule containing the
nanomachines which would
release the seal -Limiter-.

————————————————————————————

The nanomachines that were
scattered into the upper
atmosphere began to multiply
and spread throughout the
whole of the world.
 
The nanomachines glittered
in the sunlight.
Flowing like a large river
in the sky...
 
That glitter would remove
the 'bonds' restraining
everyone.
 
It was to be our light of
hope for regaining back
our true freedom...

Fei Recounts Solaris Invasion of Nisan - 1842
————————————————————————————

Solaris' 'Mobile Surface
Supremacy Weapon' invaded
the area with great force...
Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no
match against it.
 
It was only a matter of
time before the Solaris
Mobile Weapon arrived in
Nisan.
After we pushed back the
Solarian Gear units, we
headed for Nortune...
to the Kislev capital's
administrative district.
 
We went there to obtain
our one and only means
of standing up against
the Mobile Weapon.

————————————————————————————
Kislev Capital - 1002
————————————————————————————

The Kislev capital's, Nortune's
'Central Administrive District'
itself was a secret battleship
constructed by Bart's ancestor,
Roni Fatima, after the Great
War with Solaris many hundreds
of years ago.

The existence of the secret
battleship remained hidden.
Later, the ship was turned
into a section of the Kislev
Imperial capital during the
founding of the Empire.

Uncovering this truth from some
ancient records, Bart activated
the secret battleship in order
to fight against the Solarian
Mobile Surface Supremacy Weapon.

The 'Sand Cruiser Yggdrasil'
was actually the center of
command and also the main
secret weapon of the craft...
 
Awakening from 500 years
of dormancy, its true
form appeared before us.
 
Commanded by its 'new master',
the secret battleship stood
before the Mobile Weapon with
all of us inside of it.

————————————————————————————

The Solaris Mobile Weapon
was destroyed...which
brought a sigh of relief
to the continent of Ignas.
 
Peace was signed and after
some 500 years of division,
the land of Ignas once
again became united.

Excitement spread throughout
Aveh, Nisan, Kislev, Shevat...

The sky shimmered as if to
celebrate. By the hands of
Elly, Citan, Taura and
Emeralda, the nanomachines
had been dispersed into
the atmosphere.

That was when disaster struck.
...Our songs of victory were
replaced by the sounds of
total pandemonium...

In the beginning we had no
idea what had transpired.
We...witnessed unexplicable
phenomena.
People from all parts of
the globe began to mutate
into abnormal forms.

It seemed to be triggered
when the nanomachines
removed the -Limiter- seal
that was placed on humankind
by Krelian in the past...
 
...The 'human' form with its
innate abilities released.

That's when I remembered
what Hammer had said back
in Solaris.
 
His words were...
 "What becomes of the
 normal humans...?"

So, they are naturally
germinating because the

near...

Those who will become the

I never knew so many would
exist, even without using
the key...

But, some of them
still have not yet
begun to germinate...

Red 3
Are they not
destined to be

are the enemies

Miang
"The chains that restrained
humankind have been removed
because of you."

Krelian
"But that doesn't mean
there is anything wrong
with our plan...
Everything is still
under control."

Krelian
"In the event of the
explosion in the capital
of Solaris earlier...
...I had set up a nano-
machine virus to diffuse
into the atmosphere.
I knew they were eventually
going to break the seal...
But the timing was a little
close for comfort...
The current mutations of
the humans are an initial
response to the virus...
Once the virus we spread
over the world germinates
inside of the humans they
are no longer the same.
They change into a
controllable form.
We need humans that do
not depend on the key's
invocation in order to
awaken.
In other words, a being
to take the place of the
original body of god..."

Miang
"It's like a trojan horse
released at the time of the
assimilation with god...
A literal virus...
But...isn't it different
from what they intended...?"

Krelian
"Of course. We can't let
them have it their way.
The 'Ark of god' is mine."

Miang
"...Either way is fine by
me.
I will just side with
whichever is the more
certain one anyway..."

Soylent System - 1848
————————————————————————————

The Soylent System...
 
A group of facilities
formerly created by
Solaris.

These facilities existed all
over the earth.
It is said that, originally,
these were used for biological
experiments and brainwashing.

————————————————————————————
Wels Mutation - 1846
————————————————————————————

The people who mutated into
what were called Wels...or
the true form of humans...
gathered at these facilities.

Some of the humans turned
Wels were attacking healthy
humans and devouring their
flesh and blood.

That is because healthy
human flesh and blood
eased the pain of their
sudden molecular changes
and let them live longer.
 
Their lives were so short...

Soon after, severely mutated
beings started to seek the
flesh and blood of the less
mutated beings.

  Go to those facilities and
  you will be freed from the
  unbearable agony...
 
So people gathered, seeking a
fulfillment of this promise.
 
  There is salvation there...
 
The news spread...although
no one actually uttered it.

Their mutated blood
probably told such
people to 'gather'
there...

We went there to destroy
the Soylent System...

————————————————————————————
Soylent System Facility - 1850
————————————————————————————

There, humans fought
amongst themselves
greedily for limited
pardons to live.
It was an ugly battle
to keep on living.
Or so it may have seemed
to the casual passerby...
But to me they were
desperately trying to live.
It was each person's
'natural human form'.

There were the 'haves'
and the 'have-nots'...
And...among them...
were some of my former
friends from Solaris...

They wanted our flesh
and blood. They told us,
the 'haves' should share
with the 'have-nots'.
 
They asked if a 'have',
such as myself could
understand their pain...

I couldn't answer...
 
No matter what I said it
would have sounded like a
conceited 'have' speaking...
 
Even so, I wanted to
relieve their anguish...
And I decided to do so.

Just like the person in the
memory of my dreams...
in the distant past...

Then suddenly the System went
out of control!
The 'Sufal Mass', a monstrous
organism still in the process
of amalgamation, broke through
the barrier of the life-support
facilities and stood before us.

No longer of human form...
that which was once human
began eating the people
gathered there seeking
relief...
We had to fight it...
In order to save the people
and in order to save 'him'...
 
The eyes of that which was
once human looked at me,
pleading for...death...
to take away the agony.

Elly
"Citan...
please lend me
your sword."

now is ease your wounds."

Soylent System Facility - 1850

Elly
"Please! Listen to me!
Stop fighting among your-
selves. We are all humans!"

Elly
"This facility was built
by the Solaris Ministry...
It was created to implement
their 'no waste' plan.
Such facilities were to
convert mutated humans
into weapons that serve as
tools for their ambitions.
Just one part of their
overall plan of racial
purification."

Sophia
"Of course, once you
enter their umbrella
of protection...
...you can avoid
absolute death.
But is that human life?
Even if you are the only
one left, if you're
devoid of a heart,
what does it all mean?"

Elly
"All of you, want to be
loved...needed by someone,
so we look to others...
By ourselves, we are
lonely, so we try to
draw close together to
live...
That's what it means to
be human...
That's how people live.
A single hand cannot
clap."

Sophia
"To relieve your pain,
I'll give however much
of my flesh you need.
Therefore...
don't throw away your
dignity as humans...
Don't let go of your
human heart..."

Fei
"Elly...!
Are you okay? 
What are you doing?"

Elly
"You think I am doing
something...foolish?"

Fei
"No..."

Elly
"I only did what I could.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
A well-to-do 'have'.
Maybe it's only pity for
the 'have nots'...
But if I can know the joy
of giving out a little of
the life within me...
Then maybe someday it may
just be possible that one
human can truly give love
to another...
People can do it...
I truly believe they can.
That's why..."

Fei
"Elly..."

Fei in The Chair - 1840
————————————————————————————

After that, we went from place
to place, destroying all the
Soylent System facilities
located on the surface of the
earth and freed the people
held at each of the locations.
 
All the people that had been
mutated were taken in by Nisan
where they received treatment.

————————————————————————————

Those who had mutated only
mildly were treated with
Taura's nanomachines,
which reconstructed and
revived them.
 
They were able to return
back to their normal
bodies.
 
Unfortunately, there were some
that had such accelerated
symptoms that their treatment
was not as promising...

Trying to bring them back
to a form that resembled
a human was the best that
could be done.
 
However, mysteriously,
they no longer fought each
other for survival as they
did when they were held by
the Soylent System.

Of course, their recovery
from the physical pain of
the mutation may have
played a factor, but it
wasn't only that...
 
The majority of the people
received by Nisan were those
that had been admonished by
Elly and had regained their
humanity.

————————————————————————————

Between her work in destroying
the Soylent System facilities,
Elly also went around and
nursed the people in Nisan.
 
She aided the bodies of the
mutated and lent an ear to
those who had no other place
to go for help...

She was the very image of the
woman who created Nisan...
 
  'Mother Sophia'...
 
It became rumored that Elly
was a reincarnation or a
second advent of Sophia.

Go to Nisan and you will
receive salvation...
 
The news seemed to spread
further about and people
came from all over to be
saved, both physically
and spiritually.
 
Free from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers began to unite
in one place.
