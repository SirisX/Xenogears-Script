...Fei
...Fei...

Who is it?
Who's calling me...?

I...am...Har...

What is this light...?

I...I reside in Zohar.
I am the beginning and
the end.
The first and the last.

...God?

God...
Some would refer to me as that.
From a certain point of view,
it is right to view me as such.
But at the same time, I am not.
I...am also a part of you.

A part of me?

I am defined by how people
observe me.
You are actually talking to
a virtual version of me that
you yourself create...
I am 'your perception' of me.

I don't understand what
you are talking about.
Who, or what, are you?

In one word...
...EXISTENCE.

Existence?

In actuality, I do not have
a physical form.
I am an 'Existence' of a
higher dimension.
A place you cannot perceive...
But in terms you understand, it
is a world where everything
acts as kinds of waves...
It is the source of this
four-dimensional universe...
The place where time and
space is controlled...
The fluctuating void...
The 'Wave Existence'.

What does such an 'Existence'...
have to do with me...?

Long ago, a 'modifier', or a
pseudo-perpetual, infinite-
energy engine was created.
That engine was named 'Zohar'.
That reactor was created by an
ancient people from another
planet to attain what is
considered to be the ultimate
energy possible within this
four-dimensional universe.
Eventually, those people used
that same engine to create
the ultimate inter-planetary
invasion weapon, 'Deus'...
Zohar was used as its primary
source of power.
But the unexpected happened...
During the connection tests of
Zohar with the newly completed
Deus, the engine started to
examine infinite potential
phenomena...
Requiring energy, the engine
connected this dimension to
the higher dimensional space.
As a result, that reactor
'merged' or 'synchronized'
with the wave existence in
that higher dimension...ME.
I 'descended' from the point
of contact created by the
machine through the 'Path
of Sephirot', or the domain
you are in right now, and
incarnated in the four-
dimensional world.
After I 'Advented' to the four-
dimensional world, in order to
stabalize myself here, I had
to exchange, or materialize,
my form and enter into the
'modifier' engine...
In other words, I became bound
in 'Zohar'... the 'cage of
fleshly existence'.
Since the time I was bound in
Zohar, I have always wanted to
return to my own dimension...
And I came to a conclusion.
I had to reverse the process
I went through to arrive here.
I must be released by the one
who instilled within me a
special feature of this
dimension - the 'will'...
That one is you.

Decided it was me?
A special feature??

Yes.
I was given a special attribute
of a human by you, the Contact,
when you observed me...
I was given...a mother's will.

A mother's will?

I'm sure you remember.
After my descent, you had
contact with the modifier
engine, 'Zohar'.

————————————————————————————

!!

As a contact, being but only a
child, you defined my existence
with your desire to return to
your mother. Thus I came to
prepare the mother's will...
That will is Elhaym.

Elly's disposition was
influenced by me?

Yes.
My will was incarnated through
a bio-computer which was vital
for Deus.
After combining with me, the
bio-computer evolved its
functions, and that bio-plant
generated a central element.
That is her.
I was split by your contact.
My physical form or flesh
stayed in Zohar, while my
will went into Elhaym and
my power went into you.
That's why I waited to
unite with you.
And now, it is fulfilled.
My only remaining desire
is to break this 'cage
of fleshly existence'...
In order to do that, I must
become perfect by combining
with Elhaym, as well as my
other split physical form,
'Deus'.
The only way to return to
my original dimension is to
destroy this physical body.
In the four-dimensional world,
Zohar is perfect, so in order
to destroy Zohar I need the
strength that was attributed
to you...
Zohar can only be destroyed
by the hands of the 'Contact'.

What about Elly?
If Zohar is destroyed,
what will become of Elly!?

Zohar and Deus are one.
She is bound to the system
by another's will to become
one with me.
In order to release her, it
is necessary to destroy that
very system that serves as
the Deus weapon...
However, having been created
as a weapon, the Deus system
seeks to unify itself with
all of you for a different
purpose than that of mine.
Originally, her release
should have been performed
by me, the one who desires
to return back to the higher
dimension...
But, I am also bound to the
system just as she is, so I
am unable to participate.
You are the only one who
can release her from the
spell.
Just as Deus and I are
inseparable, you and her
are also inseparable.

...Alright.
I'll destroy Deus and
the Zohar modifier.
And I'll save Elly.

You have experienced much loss
and deprivation in your life.
It is very tragic.
Our contact, and the resulting
transference of power and will
between you and I, most likely
played a factor in splitting
your personality.

I disagree.
I can't blame anything
or anyone besides myself.
Regardless of what may have
happened in the past, with
the passing of time the
cause becomes more remote.
It is a problem that comes
from within myself, that I
myself must deal with...

I see...
You have managed to accept
those tragedies, to tolerate
all things, to comprehend
and find where you stand in
this world.
If you have succeeded to
do all these things, I am
sure you will succeed in
what awaits you now.

To liberate all of us...
Use...the...Xe...no...gears
...des...troy...Zohar...

Wait!
There's more I need
to ask you...

The system...is awakening...
Ask...her...later...
