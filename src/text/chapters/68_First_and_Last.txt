Fei
"This
is...Deus!?"

Chu-Chu
"What are those
four orbs spinning
around it?"

Maria
"It seems as if the power
of those four things is
supporting the center."

Rico
"So that means that big
thing in the middle is
the core of Deus?"

Citan
"Probably."

Bart
"Who cares about those
orbs. Let's just crush
the core."

Citan
"Striking directly at the
center rather than using
fuel unnecessarily...
That is one strategy. But,
I believe another plan of
attack would be to defeat
its surroundings first.
If we decide to attack
the supporting orbs first,
then it might be wise to
leave the battles up to us.
We should be able to do
something about them
without using up Fei's
power."

Emeralda
"That'll allow him to
use the full power of
Xenogears...
...To defeat Deus.
And yes, of course,
to save Elly!"

Billy
"Whether we do a direct
strike to the core or take
down the supports first...
I guess that is best left
up to Fei to decide..."

Fei
"...
Thanks everyone.
To attack Deus directly...
or, to take out its
supports first...
I wonder which is best?"

Ω Boss Fights - Deus Final Form (& Supports)
————————————————————————————

Fei
"What...happened?"

Rico
"My Gear won't
budge anymore."

Citan
"The Zohar Modifier
has ceased functioning.
That is probably the
reason why our Gears
cannot move anymore. 
There is only a slight
energy response coming
from the core now."

Fei
"What about Elly?
What's happening to her
inside of that thing?
The Deus system's bind
on her should have worn
off now. 
So why aren't we getting
any kind of response!?
You don't think we hurt her
in that battle too...!?"

Citan
"Fei, calm down!
The sensors are picking
up a response from a
life form within Deus.
It is probably Elly.
So do not worry...
I believe she is okay!"

Fei
"Elly!
Can you hear me, Elly!?
Deus is no longer active.
It's all over now...
So come out of there.
Show me your face! 
Elly! Elly!"

Bart
"W, what the...?
What's happening...!?"

Fei
"Doc!?
What's going on?
What's wrong?"

Citan
"I am now detecting a
tremendous amount of energy
coming from within Deus.
It seems as if something
that was sealed up till now
has suddenly been freed and
is growing enormously..."

Fei
"It couldn't be...
the 'Wave Existence'!?"

Bart
"The 'Wave Existence'?"

Fei
"That's gotta be it.
The 'Wave Existence' was
just freed from its 'cage
of fleshly existence' in
Zohar...
It's probably attempting
to return to the higher
dimension that it
originally came from."

Citan
"Which means...this is
the aftereffect of the
dimensional shift!?"

Rico
"What do you mean...
'aftereffect'!?"

Citan
"It is like a shock wave
that is induced by the
dimensional displacement.
But...so much energy!?
If this much energy is
unleashed here now..."

Fei
"...If so much energy is
unleashed...then what will
happen, doc!? Tell us!"

Citan
"...Then this planet
will be annihilated!
These numbers indicate
that it has more than
enough energy to take
out a whole planet!"

Chu-Chu
"Whatchu mean!?"

Bart
"You can't be serious!?"

Billy
"We all fought so
hard...only to see
this happen...!?"

Fei
"Isn't there...
isn't there anything
we can do?
Can't we stop the
aftereffect!?"

Citan
"Unfortunately, there
is nothing we can do...
Almost all machinery,
including our Gears, are
out of commission due to
Zohar having been shutdown.
This time, there is nothing
we can do...
To put it to you straight
...this is the end for us!"

Bart
"This is freakin' stupid!
How the hell could it all
end like this!?
What were we all fighting
for up to now!?"

Billy
"Th, the vibrations
are intensifying..."

Rico
"Hold on a sec...!
No, these vibrations
are different!
It has to be something
else causing it..."

Maria
"Look!"

Bart
"Deus is...!"

Fei
"Deus is rising!?"

Chu-Chu
"What is it
this time!?"

Citan
"Deus is releasing its
remaining energy and is
beginning to accelerate...
If it continues to
accelerate at this rate,
it will soon leave the
atmosphere..."

Fei
"You don't think...!?"

Bart
"Think what!?"

Fei
"That it's Elly!?
Elly is moving Deus...!"

Rico
"Are you sure!?"

Fei
"I'm sure of it!
Elly is trying to save
us by moving Deus away
from our planet!
She's going to
sacrifice herself..."

Maria
"That can't be...
Oh, Elly..."

Billy
"Can't we do anything...?
We can't just sit here and
watch this happen, can we?"

Citan
"..."

Fei
"Wait...
There is still
something I can do!"

Chu-Chu
"What is it, Fei!?"

Fei
"My Gear still works.
Without Zohar, the power
source for your Gears, the
only Gear that now remains
active is mine.
Just like Deus, my Gear
and I made contact with
Zohar. We are the only
one's who can move now.
I am going to go save
Elly!"

Citan
"That is absurd!
Even if you were able to
catch up to Deus, you will
not have enough energy to
make it back!"

Fei
"Even so, I still must go.
Elly's taking the whole
burden upon herself!
If anything happens to
her...
I want to be there with
her..."

Bart
"Hey!
Just wait a minute!
You know I'm not gonna
stand by and let you commit
double suicide...if that's
what you're planning!"

Fei
"Bart..."

Bart
"...
You better come back
alive, you hear!?
Promise me!!
Promise me that you
will come back...
Then I'll let you go!!"

Fei
"...Thanks, Bart.
I promise.
I promise you that
I will return...
with Elly!"

Bart
"You better."

Fei
"Yeah, of course!"

Bart
"Alright!
Then get goin'!"

Citan
"But...!"

Bart
"Let's let him go, Citan.
At this point, Fei's the
only one that'll be able
to bring Elly back.
There's nothing we can
say or do about it."

Citan
"...You are right. Fei,
keep your promise..."

Billy
"No matter what..."

Maria
"Fei and Elly..."

Emeralda
"Both of you..."

Rico
"Come back home..."

Chu-Chu
"We'll be waiting
for you chu!"

Fei
"I appreciate this...
Bart...
and the rest of you...
Well I had better get
going now...
But don't worry!
I will be back soon!"

Fei
"I guess this will be
the last journey you
and I make together...
I'm counting on you...
partner!"

Elly!!

Inner Consciousness - 2044
————————————————————————————

Where am I...!?

That's Elly!
This must mean that
I am inside of Deus!?

Not exactly.
Your actual body is but a
physical object... It has
merely been absorbed into
Deus' outer-shell.
Only your consciousness is
here.
Of course, the girl you
perceive in front of you is
also not a true being.
Your consciousness is merely
creating her image.

!?

The 'Wave Existence'...?
No...that's not you...!!
Who are you...?

It can't be...!?
Is that you Krelian!?
That's right, isn't it...!?
Krelian! It was you who did 
this to Elly!

The 'Path of Sephirot' has
been connected.
No one can stop god from
returning to his world now.
So what have you come here
for, Lacan?

I came here to take the
person I love back with me!
So set Elly free!
The Deus' system has been
destroyed.
It's all over now!
So instead I ask you...
What are you hoping to
achieve now!?

The time when all things
started...
The place where all things
were one...
I am going to return there!

What place?

Before the beginning of the
universe, in the undulating
waves of the higher dimension,
all things were one.
It was the waves spilling out
from there that created this
four-dimensional universe of
ours.
'Humankind' and the 'Souls of
Humankind' that were born from
there, are merely leftovers of
those spilled waves.
So...

You're going back there?
Is that what you desired?

Lacan...
Why such reluctance to
become one with the god?
What attachment could you
possibly have to this
wretched old world?
What meaning can be found
in living out such a short
existence...hurting others,
hurting yourself, grinding
one another down...only to
inevitably die and return
to dust?
Why, everything we could
ever desire is here...
No need to be troubled by
the need for love...
For this place is filled
with the love of god.

I have not lost hope in
humans as much as you have,
Krelian...
Someday humankind will come
to understand one another!
I sincerely believe that!

How can you be so sure?
Humans will never come to
understand each other.
You said that she is the
person you love.
But can you say that you
even truly understand
each other?
All humans do is place
themselves at a comfortable
distance from each other
and call that 'mutual under-
standing', 'spiritual unity',
or 'true love'...
but it is all lies!
Man cannot associate with
others without first
deceiving themselves.
That is the way that they
were created.

But one being's ego can't
determine everyone's fate!
People have the right to
choose their own destiny!
That is why humans have
free will!

And what if that 'will'
itself was predetermined?
What then?
Oh, what folly!?!
Humans are just primitive
life forms that have no
such things as free will...
Mankind has merely been
allowed to live in an
imperfect state...
"as is", "as will be"...
It is for this very reason...
because humans have this
wretched 'will' or whatnot...
that humans must experience
sadness and loss.
For someone to gain something
means another must lose it...
It is impossible to make
humankind share limited
"things" and "affections"...
So I came to the conclusion
that everything must be
reverted back to where it
all began.
To go back to when all was
one...
waves, and nothing else...
It is not my -Human's- ego...
It is the will of the 'Waves'
...the will of -god-...

Well that's alright, too...
We don't have to be perfect.
Actually, being imperfect
makes mankind live by
helping each other...
That's what being human is...
That's mutual understanding!
That's 'unity' and 'love'...
I'm glad...no, I'm proud...
to be human!

Elly placed the future,
-tomorrow-, in our hands,
based on our choice...
And she is working to keep
Deus far from our planet.
She is also trying to heal
your heart...
you, who wants to journey,
all alone, to be with god...
Can't you understand Elly's
feelings!?
Do you have to become one
with god before you are able
to comprehend all of this?
I understand...
I know her feelings...
as if they were my own...
Yes...she and I are one!
We don't need god's help!!

Well then, prove it to me...
Show me this power of humans!
Show me this -love-,
that you say can make you
independent of god...

Fei
"Elly..."

Elly
"Fei...
It was Krelian...
Krelian released me..."

Fei
"Krelian...?"

Elly
"Yes. I came to understand
after becoming one with
Krelian...
His heart was so full of
sadness. That is why he
desired for he and I to
become one with god...
Because that would be the
return to the beginning of
everything...
He told me...
"You should be with him..."
That is what he said...
You see...
He already knew!
Yes, he already knew...
how I felt, how you felt...
But there was nothing we
or he could do...
He had no choice but to go
forward... even if it meant
he lost all feelings, lost
everything that was human!
For all humankind's sake...
There was no going back...
Even looking back held too
many memories...
And he would have...
just wanted to go back...
Even though he couldn't...
So please forgive him...
Krelian loved people more
than anyone else..."

Fei
"I... 
I, somehow...
knew it all along...
I just knew he was really
that kind of person..."

Elly
"...I am so sorry...
Please forgive me!
I was wrong...
I thought sacrificing
myself in order to save
others was the right
thing to do...
But my actions only brought
sadness to all the people
who I left behind.
And that sadness gave birth
to even more sadness.
As long as 'I' still live
within you, my life is not
just mine alone."

Fei
"Elly...
That isn't wrong.
To sacrifice yourself for
others is a noble thing...
Even if it were to benefit
yourself, it's no problem.
There will always be a
person healed...
One or the other...
Love gains its original
shine only when there's an
interrelationship between
the giver and the receiver.
It is incomplete when one
or the other is missing...
The two are one.
It was you, Elly, who
taught me that.
I believe that is what it
means to be human...
I can now understand the
true importance of it.
I don't know if it's the
right answer or not...
But we have a lot of time
to think about it...
What Krelian himself was
looking for all along...
We will find the answer to
it all...ourselves..."

Elly
"Thank you...
Fei!"

Fei
"Elly..."

"This is your home planet,
that you're now standing on."

Fei
"Krelian...you aren't going
are you?"

Krelian
"No...Since that time,
I have stopped being human.
I've committed so many sins,
that any attempt at living
like a human...is impossible.
The only one that could have
forgiven me...is God."

Fei
"That's not true!
I know they would understand.
There's still plenty of time
to atone for your sins.
You, of all people, 
could do it!"

Krelian
"Always the peacemaker, hey
Lacan? Perhaps that's what
it means to be humans.
But regardless, I cannot go.
It's something I've already
decided. I go to walk with
God. Even if there's no
place left for me...upon
my return."

"I must go now..."

Fei
"Krelian!"
