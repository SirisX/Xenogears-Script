Ramsus
"Miang,
is that him?"

Miang
"Yes, he's in the
black Gear in the
center there."

Ramsus
"Right.
I've got him!"

Ramsus
"I have been
looking for you!
My arch rival!!"

Fei
"Uh! You again!?"

Ramsus
"...I see you have a
different machine...
So, what happened to
your 'other Gear'!?"

Fei
"What are you
talking about!?"

Ramsus
"Not to matter...
At any rate, until
I eliminate you,
there will never be
any 'light' for me!!"

Doctor
"...I don't know. 
But for now he's on life 
support......"

Citan
"...You mean... 
He will be alright...?"

Doctor
"...I guarantee nothing. 
I don't know why he's like
this in the first place."

Bart
"..."

Elly
"...My fault?
...I..."

Doctor
"...Then there is hope
...at the infirmary in
the 'Ethos' headquarters."

!

Elly
"Fei...
Can you save Fei?"

Doctor
"I cannot guarantee it.
But if we were to take
him to the 'Ethos'
headquarters' hospital..."

Elly
"Then could we save him?"

Doctor
"I think then that he
would most probably
pull through alright...
But unfortunately, ordinary
citizens are only allowed
into the main hall at
the 'Ethos' headquarters.
You would have to become a
monk, or be introduced by
someone in the 'Ethos'..."

Elly
"..."

Doctor
"Ah, I just remembered.
I heard that the Etone,
-'atoners of sin'-,
are coming to Thames
from the 'Ethos' H.Q...."

Citan
"What purpose do such
Etone from the 'Ethos'
have here?"

Doctor
"They're coming here
to do some type of
investigation."

Bart
"Etone...
What are they?"

Doctor
"They are religious people
from the 'Ethos' who cleanse
away the 'Reapers' or -Wels-
that appear here in Aquvy."

Elly
"So why don't we ask them?"

Doctor
"I'll ask them if they can
help us, but I don't know
if they will...
I guess there is no harm
in asking though..."

Elly
"Alright. Let's go look
for them."

Citan
"I will go with Fei and
the life support machines
to the Yggdrasil.
Bart and Elly, you two go
look for the Etone."

Bart
"...Right."
