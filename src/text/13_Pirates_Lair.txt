Citan
"Fei!
I was worried about you!"

Fei
"Doc..."

Maison
Welcome to the sand cruiser
"Yggdrasil". We apologize
for that earlier incident.

Maison
"I'm sure everyone has
already had the courtesy
to introduce themselves. 
But allow me to introduce
the sand pirates' leader,
Master Bartholomew."

Maison
"By the way, may I ask,
young master, did you
apologize to Master Fei?" 

Bart
"What?  Uhh...yeah...
I told him I was
'wrong'... Right?"

Fei
...

First Mate
Just telling someone you
were 'wrong' after the
event isn't going to solve
everything, young master.

First Mate
"I'm sorry I've delayed
introducing myself...
My name is "Sigurd", the
First Mate of this sand
cruiser.
Fei...that was your name,
right? Hyu... I mean,
Citan told me a little
about what happened.
We caused you so much
trouble because we acted
recklessly. I sincerely
apologize to you.
As recompense, allow us to
give you a ride to what-
ever destination you want.
But, please excuse us for
a while as we make a detour
to go back to our base for
supplies.
In the mean time, enjoy a
pleasant cruise...or should
I say, 'sand cruise'.
It must be fate that we
met like this..."

Maison
"Well then, please let me
know if you need anything."

Bart
"...That's the situation...
So now, forgive me, will
ya!?"

Sigurd
"Young master!
Stay out of mischief."

Bart
"Ouch ouch ouch!!
Don't pull my ears!"

Citan
"Let us go and wait in our
cabin until we arrive...
It is well-made and
comfortable."

Fei
"..."

Citan
"What is wrong?
You look down."

Fei
"No...
Well..."

Citan
"Something happened?"

Fei
"No, nothing."

Gear Mechanic
What do you want to do?
    View Gear from here
    View Gear from front
    Hear lowdown on Gear
    Nothing

This is Weltall.
Height 16.3 sharls
Base Weight 17.8 kahnns
Full Weight 22.7 kahnns
when fully equipped.
A well balanced Gear in
offensive, defensive,
and Ether abilities.
But it has some parts that
cannot be disassembled...
I guess you can call them
'blackboxes'...?
They don't cause problems
in maintenance, but they
just get on my mind every
time that I see them.

This is Brigandier,
our boss, the young
master's Gear.
Height 17.0 sharls
Base Weight 13.9 kahnns
Full Weight 18.6 kahnns
when fully equipped.
It is specially tuned for
desert battles. The power
of the Hover-thrusters in
the legs are especially
worthy of attention...
Oh, and the eyepatch and
feather decorations were
added later at the young
master's request.

We didn't know what to do
when young master said,
"Destroy one sensor and
put an eyepatch over it
...without weakening the
ability to reconnoiter..."!

Soldier 1
That Gear with the
slender build withstood
Brigandier's rod?
What kind of armor did
they use to cover it?

Officer 1
Maitreya admired your
dive technique.
I hear your zoom
technique is flawless.
Do you think you
can train me on
my next watch?

Officer 1???
Now, I must ready the Gear
parts. Maitreya's strict
with this sort of thing.

Officer 2
Hey? Did you see this month's
edition of "Gear Fan Magazine"?
They say, 'Hovering' is all

Until a while back, it used

only the young master had
equipped on his Gear!

Oh please, no one's there.

Hum...you're too skinny.
You need more nutrition.

Good!!
Perfect weight.

You're too fat.
Cut down on sweets!

Oh my!
This is what they call...
You'd better watch it!

Sick Man
Is this wound from the

"I hope you are not
too taken back?
Lately, there are far too
many barbaria... I mean...
highly energetic lads,
around the young master.
So, yours truly, who is
in charge of education,
demanded to have this
room created!!"

(But, because of that,
I ended up having to
take a side job...)

"How may I be of service?"
    Items
    Weapons/Accessories
    Nothing now, thanks.
	
Maison
"I hope I can be of
such service again!"

Technician 1
Once again, final checks!
Every second counts!
The young master forever!

When we had engine trouble
a long time ago, the young
master jumped in to fix it.
Sigurd tried to help the
young master and they both
ended up injuring one eye.

Technician 2
We are proud of the young
master, but...he sometimes
rushes into things.
The chief thinks it's
all his own fault.

Chief
Amateurs don't

So get lost!

Nobody touches the machine
here except myself.

Bart
"We're almost at
my hideout!"

Crew 1
That Jerico! He lets the
Yggdrasil drift, so that
the time and routes we
take end up being off...

Crew 2
Do you want to see
the ship's chart?
    Yeah, show me!
    No thanks.
	
Crew 3
While under the sand, there
is nothing but static...
As a matter of fact, there
is nothing to do either...

Crew 4
It's a lot harder to
control the ship after the
young master steered it.
He is so reckless...

Crew 5
I had a competition going  
on with the young master
the other day to see who
could tip the boat further.
Old Maison literally was
white as a sheet, saying
all the teacups were
destroyed...

Franz
"Oh, sorry...
I didn't realize that you
were there! 
Wanna hear some hot sounds
that I have recorded?"
    Sure.
    No thanks.

Franz
"Wanna hear some more?"
    Yeah, this is cool!
    No, enough already!

Franz
"Ahh...
Well that's too bad."

Gunman
When it comes to cannons, 
you don't know where the
shells will fly to until
you've actually shot'em.
But, they're suitable
for the pirating trade
because they're cheap
yet intimidating...
On the other hand though,
torpedoes blow everything
to blazes and are down-
right expensive too...

Crew 6
This ship uses innumerable
effect wings to pulverize
sand and wade through it.
If our balance is lost, 
we roll over in the desert.
It's all up to our skill!

I have to repair some of
the pumps that died now.
Oh, I also have to re-cover
the effect wings...

"We're almost at the

you back!

Everyone
Welcome back!

Girl
Bart! 
What did you bring us?

Bart
"Well...I've got a new
model Gear and two people
that we helped out."

Little Boy
Ehh!
A Gear...how boring! 
Don't you have anything 
more interesting?

Bart
"I thought you'd
say that..."

Bart
"Look! This is amber I
found in a stalactite
cavern under the desert.
It's rare to find one 
with a bug in it!"

Girl
Wow!
Thanks Bart!

Girl
We got some amber!

Boy
What's that?

Girl
Let's go!
We gotta show it
off to everyone!

Bart
"Well then...
I'm gonna tune up
my Gear a little...
Why don't you two go
have some tea with
Old Maison."

Maison
"This is the dining hall.
I'm sorry it is so gauche."

Maison
"Please take a seat."

Maison
"Perhaps you would like 
some of my famous tea? 
Master Fei? Good Doctor?"

Maison
"Young visitors are rare
indeed, the young master
must be very happy.
If things were normal we
wouldn't be living in the
desert, but rather back
in the royal palace..."

Citan
"Royal palace...? You mean
that young one is connected
to the old Fatima dynasty?"

Maison
"Pardon?"

Maison
"N, no...
I'm just a senile old fool
who talks too much...
Pay no attention to what
I just said...
Hahaha..."

Citan
"But...that one-eyed
youth does have a
certain bearing."

Maison
"Oh...oh...oh...!
Well spoken Sir! Awfully
good of you to notice!"

Maison
"If I may...
I would like to tell you.
The young gent is the last
forgotten reminder of the
once proud Fatima dynasty.
...That is, before it was
destroyed by Shakhan's
minions...

Prince 
Bartholomew 
Fatima.

Citan
"Bartholomew?
Edbart IV's successor...
I am sure they announced
Bartholomew died of an
illness 12 years ago..."

Maison
"Officially, yes.
However in reality, we
rescued the young prince
from Shakhan's evil grasp."

Citan
"Then why must the prince,
the rightful heir, resort
to piracy...?"

Maison
"..."

Maison
"Since fleeing here, we
have had only one wish...
...that the young master
would grow up to be a
great man..."

Citan
"Not to...
reclaim the throne?"

Maison
"That is correct.
Of course, to say we have
absolutely no desire to
restore his rule...
would be a lie.
We have plans for that
as well."

Citan
"And part of those plans
would include piracy...?"

Maison
"Well, yes... 
But there is a reason
for that..."

Pirate's Lair - Maison telling their history - 0768
————————————————————————————

Maison
"Both Aveh and Kislev are
devoted to excavating the
ruins.
Each country's strength
is increasing daily.
Even if we could get the
help of all our comrades
to start a revolution...
...the combined strength
of all of us would still
not be enough.
We would certainly be
suppressed by Shakhan's
guards in no time at all."

We needed power.
We tried excavating the
ruins using the Yggdrasil
but it didn't work as
well as we expected.

Excavating requires
tremendous amounts of
time, labor and capital.
The best we can do with
our sand cruiser is find
small items in the sand.

Citan
"And the piracy..."

————————————————————————————
Pirate's Lair - Dining Hall - 0756
————————————————————————————

Maison
"Regardless of who gains
the ruins' technology,
one thing is certain...
Both Kislev and Aveh will
simply use that power to
oppress the other.
I agreed with the young
master's idea of creating
a new power to balance
things out a little."

Citan
"I see...
It is far more effective
to plunder from the
shadows, than to excavate
the technology oneself."

Maison
"Of course pillaging is
an unpardonable act.
However...
for Aveh,
for Ignas, 
to continue like this..."

"I'm sorry if it sounds
rather self-righteous."

Citan
"That is something which
outsiders like ourselves
cannot comment upon.
From what you have told
me, I feel that the result
of what you are doing will
be good.
Seeing your children here
tells me that."

Maison
"I am much relieved 
by your words."

Maison
"Another cup of tea?"

Citan
"Yes please.
Thank you."

Citan
"You mentioned you had
plans. Why have you not
put them into action?"

Maison
"With Miss Margie
imprisoned, we dare
not do anything."

Citan
"She would not
happen to be
Nisan's...?"

Maison
"You are well informed,
my dear doctor.
She is the Great Mother
Marguerite of Nisan...
and the young master's
cousin, as well."

Citan
"Why would Shakhan
take her captive?"

Maison
"For the 'Fatima Jasper'!"

Citan
"The Fatima Jasper that
is said to show where
great treasure is?"

Maison
"My, good Doctor!
You do know an awful lot.
I am most impressed."

!

Maison
"You do not like my tea,
Master Fei?"

Fei
"No...
I'm just not
thirsty now!"

Maison
"Well, we have no idea
what the great treasure
actually is...
But it is said to be
strong enough to save
our kingdom if it is
ever in plight!"

Citan
"And Marguerite has
the Jasper that tells
the location?"

Maison
"Only half of it,
to be precise.
The young master
and Miss Marguerite
each have half.
Only by combining
the two halves will
anyone know where
the treasure is."

Citan
"What exactly is
the Fatima Jasper?
When you say a half
of the Jasper, I
imagine some kind
of necklace..."

Maison
"Only the heirs to Aveh
and Nisan know what it
really looks like."

Citan
"I see.
So that is why they
have her locked up.
My guess is that when
they do find out, her
chances of living are
not..."

Citan
"Ah, I apologize. 
I simply,
I mean...
I was only supposing
the worst case. 
So please do not take
it to heart..."

Maison
"No, that is a terribly
realistic scenario."

Citan
"..."

Citan
"Ahem.
What exactly do you mean
by great treasure...?"

Maison
"Well,
I haven't the foggiest..."

Bart
The Gear...!
He means the Gear!
It has to be it!

Maison
"Young master...
are the Gears alright?"

Bart
"Yeah...
Even though they were
sealed, sand's gotten
into the joints.
It's a pain in the neck
to fix, so I'm having
the crew take care of
it now.
My job is just to pilot
them anyway.
Besides, I'm bad with 
machines, so I'd just
get in the way."

Maison
Young master...

Bart
"Anyway...
What were we
talking about?"

Citan
"Whether the great
treasure could be
a...Gear?"

Bart
"Oh, yeah.
You know, something like
that is drawn in one of
the Aveh picture scrolls."

Citan
"Picture scrolls?"

...

Bart
"Well, if you're interested
then let's go to the
planning room...
I'll show you what I
mean...since you're my
special guests."

Citan
"That sounds
interesting."

Bart
"Heh heh. Surprised? 
All this technology
is thanks to Sig."

Bart
"Hey, Fei!
Don't stand on the screen.
We won't be able to see!"

Bart
"Alright men!
Display my special file
on the main screen."

Citan
"What is this...?"

Bart
"A picture scroll, nearly
500 years old.
This is King Fatima I...
'body cloaked in flames
making a blood oath with
giants'.
They say he used the
strength of the giants
to found Aveh."

Citan
"It is amazing that such an
ancient scroll exists...
and in such good state too!
I thought the 'Ethos'
controlled all such things
as these..."

Bart
"Normally, yes.
But this was one of
my father's prized
possessions."

Bart
"Next!"

Bart
"After founding the
country, Fatima forced the
giants into slumber...
...to protect his kingdom's
people if needed in the
future. But we don't know
where they are hidden.
In another record, one of
the giants is called the
'Great Fatima Treasure'."

Citan
"What about
the 'Jasper'?"

Bart
"Hey...
you sure know a lot.
Perhaps you're one
of Shakhan's spies?"

Citan
"Of course not.
It is only an intellectual
interest..."

Bart
"Just kidding. It appears
the Jasper is the key to
finding our treasure."

Citan
"A key...
Could that be what
Shakhan is looking 
for?"

Bart
"Not just him.
Gebler is also
looking for it."

Citan
"Really?
Then we must rescue
Marguerite as soon
as possible."

Bart
"You're telling me!"

Bart
"Since we helped you...I
was wondering if I could,
in turn, ask you a favor?"

Citan
"Would that be...
for us to help you
rescue her...?"

Bart
"Bright boy!
That's exactly it.
I heard from Sigurd...
it seems that both Aveh
and Kislev are after you!
So we can help you and
you can help us...
How about it? 
It's not much to ask."

Citan
"Well, if it pays for my
room and board then I will
help in any way I can..."

Citan
"What do you think, Fei?
You have not said
anything for a while..."

Bart
"Yeah.
You were great back there
in that stalactite cavern.
Your strength alone is
greater than ten or twenty
of Shakhan's guards."

Fei

Bart
"I'd love to have
your power on my
side!"

Fei
"Why does everyone want
to make me fight?"

Bart
"H, huh...
What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?"

Citan
Fei?

Fei 
"I just don't feel like it!
'Love to have my power'?
I don't have any!
What's wrong with you,
doc, everyone...
You're driving me to the
brink.
Then there's that Gear...
Grahf and my father...
I don't have the time to
help you out with your
problems when I've got
enough of my own!!"

Bart
"What's with him?
Is he always that
short-tempered?"

Citan
"No, that is not it...
I am sorry.
Things have happened so
fast that he has not had
time to deal with it all
yet. Try to understand."

...Is that it?"

Fei
"Don't you? 
Sure looks that way.
It looks like the only
thing you do enjoy is
fighting."

Bart
"I can't let that slide.
Who likes fighting? 
Take it back.
Like it or not, I fight
because I have to.
I got my reasons, but
you wouldn't understand."

Fei
"Well I don't have a
reason to fight!
I don't want to fight.
I just want to live 
in peace and quiet.

But you people keep on
hounding me to get into
a Gear? Why don't you
just leave me alone!?"

Bart
"It's because I
see your skill
and think..."

Fei
"Well I hate it!
Whenever I get in a Gear
people get hurt.
If I fight, people die.
I don't want to hurt people!
I don't want anyone to die!
I hate it...
can't you see that?"

Bart
"Yeah, I know the
feeling of just wanting
to run away from reality.
But do you think the kids
left behind in your
village would understand?"

Fei
...

Bart
"Citan told me what 
happened in Lahan.
Would it have been better
if you had done nothing? 
Sure, that happened because
you were in the Gear.
But even if you hadn't,
people would have died...
Right?
You weren't the reason.
War...no, the people
who started the war are
the reason.
And unless you get rid of
the reason, nothing will
change. I fight to get
rid of the reason...
Right now there is no
other way so I have to
fight... But that doesn't
mean I enjoy it."

Bart
"I understand why you
would feel guilt toward
the kids in your village.
And I know why you don't
want to harm others.
But if you want to make 
it up to those children,
don't you have to fight?"

Bart
"You do have a reason to
fight. A reason you must
fight.
But as long as you ignore
it and continue to run
away, those kids will
never forgive you.
Just remember that."

Bart
"And another thing,
I'm not saying that not
helping me is running
away.
You don't have to help.
This is my own problem.
I don't wanna get you in
this against your will.
But, if I had your skill
I could bring all of
this to an end...
And make it up to those
kids. At least that's
what I think..."

Anyway...
sorry to hold you up.
The mechanic wanted to
talk to you about your
Gear.
You probably don't care
now, but at least hear
what he has to say.

Alright, alright!!
Off your butts and
back to work!

Oh, Fei! 
You can take this elevator
down to the Gear Hangar.
Why don't you check on
Weltall and do
whatever maintenance
you feel like doing?

Gear Mechanic
Looks like someone really
knew how to tune up your
Gear...
Attack, defense, 
Ether amplification... 
an exceptionally balanced
machine.
But we don't seem to be
able to dismantle some
parts to see what they
do...
I guess you could call
them...black boxes.
There are quite a number
of them on this machine...
Do you have any idea what
they actually do?

Fei
"No..."

Fei

Citan
Fei! 

Fei
"Sigurd, doc...
What's up...?"

Sigurd
"We would like
to have a word
with you..."

"Oh, okay!"

Sigurd
"Look over there..."

Bart (Inner Monologue)
Hey, dad...
Can you hear me? 
Ever since I first looked
in Fei's eyes I knew...
He's the same as me.
He'd understand me...
Or so I thought...
Did I just imagine it?

I have no confidence. 
If I follow after you,
dad...It'll just be like
I'm some decoration.
At the moment, I can't
even carry out your will,
let alone rescue Margie...

I told him he was only
running away but I'm
really the one who
wants to run away...

Sigurd
"The young master asked
me to apologize to you. 
Pretty strange, huh?
He knows it's best to
apologize in person...
But the young master
isn't all that good at
this sort of thing..."

Sigurd
"He may not look it,
but he's really quite
lonely...
He's always searching
for a friend.
We, his minders, can't
become his friends.
Even if we wanted to,
he just wouldn't see
us that way.
He knows that."

Sigurd
"Why you ask?
It's because of the
burden that he bears.
It must be difficult
for one so young to
carry so heavy a
responsibility.
But he does try to do
his best, you know?
That is why we stick
by him... It has
nothing to do with
him being the prince."

Sigurd
"Fei, I sense you too
are carrying a heavy
burden.
This might be a selfish
request, but...would it
be possible for you to
help the young master?
I'm not asking you to
burden yourself with
his problems or
responsiblities.
But could you two...
with whatever it is only
you two each know, help
the other? Please..."

Fei
"I'm sorry...
I need time to think."

Sigurd
"Of course...take your
time. It is completely
up to you.
Whatever you decide, we
will be leaving early
tomorrow morning.
After you're finished
preparing for tomorrow,
you probably should get
some rest.
You can use the bedroom
in the residential area
above."

Citan
"I wish to speak to Sigurd
some more...so you go
ahead and get some rest."

Fei
