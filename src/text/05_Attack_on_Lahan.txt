Fei
"No!
Lahan's...!?"

Citan
"Alice!?
Timothy!!"

Alice
"Doctor Uzuki!?
Fei!!"

Timothy
"Doctor! They just came
outta nowhere and landed
right in our village...!"

Citan
"I know. What on earth
are they doing starting
a battle here...!?
Are you all okay?"

Alice
"Yes!
But it's Dan...
We can't find him!!"

Timothy
"I'll go look one more
time! Alice, go ahead and 
get out of the village."

Citan
"No, Timothy, wait!!
You, Alice and the
rest of the villagers
should evacuate to a
safer location!"

Timothy
"Doc, you know I
can't just leave
Dan behind!"

Alice
"Timothy..."

Citan
"I understand how you feel,
but leave the rest up to
Fei and me!
The primary thing you
should be concerned with
is your own safety...
Timothy, your
responsibility is
to protect Alice!"

Timothy
"...
But..."

Fei
"It's just as doc says.
The two of you should get
out of the village now!
Don't worry about Dan.
Knowing him, he has
already evacuated and
is waiting for you!"

Timothy
"...
I guess you're right..."

Timothy
"Okay! Alice, let's let
Doctor Uzuki and Fei
handle it from here!"

Alice
"...
Yes, okay.
Thank you, Doctor!"

Alice
"But, Fei...
Please look out for Dan!"

Fei
"Yeah, don't worry.
If he still happens to be
in the village, I'll be
sure to save him!"

Citan
"Now, both of you,
hurry!!"

Citan
"I will go check inside
the houses to see if there
is anyone left behind.
Fei, please go around
the village and guide
the stragglers to a
safe location!"

Fei
"Alright!
But doc...
You be careful, okay!!?"

Citan
"You too, Fei!"

Fei
"Whoa!!"

Fei
"...
Ah...!?"

We had better get
away from here."

Timothy
"I knew you were still
in the village! Boy,
I'm glad you're okay!"

Huh...!?

Citan
"Oh no...!
Timothy!!"

Timothy
"Uh...!"

Fei
"Wait!!
Don't shoot!!"

Fei
"Stop it!!
These people have nothing
to do with you!"
